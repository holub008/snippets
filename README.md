# snippets
This repository contains:

* Demos of (what I think are) cool algorithms & methods
* My first trys at new problems and technologies
* Small pieces of code that don't belong as an isolated project

My favorite pieces are:

* [Tree learning](tree_learning/tree_learning_overview.pdf): a hands on description of decision trees & ensemble methods like RandomForest & boosting
* [The overlapped hyperrectangle problem](overlapped_hyperrectangles/overlapped_hyperrectangles.pdf)
* [The uniform Plinko problem](uniform_plinko/description.md): generating an asymptotic uniform distribtion from Plinko boards

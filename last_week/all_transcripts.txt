let's talk about Mexico number seven on

the list of things that Donald Trump is

most frightened of just a head of

Muslims and just behind the concept of

self-reflection Mexico is a nation of a

hundred twenty three million people give

or take a few Americans spring break

douche bags like these to Cancun is the

hands-down best phasing and every spring

especially being a college kid give a

tip see then get drunk and then a little

bit of Yale on top of everything a lot

of it if you get tired here can't

confess for that so cool it's my

favorite part of that clip is that in

the corner it promotes something called

brain surgery life which I sincerely

hope is just a brain surgeon

lobotomizing these two bros but but

Mexico isn't just a tourist destination

we share a 1900 mile border and they're

our third largest trading partner and

something massive is about to take place

there it's going to be the biggest

election in Mexican history with

positions up for grabs from Mexico City

Mayor to congressional seats to the top

job itself it's true next Sunday we'll

see the biggest election in Mexico's

history which I know probably doesn't

mean much to most Americans it's like

saying the biggest mattress sale in

Dutch history or the biggest Mouse penis

in Portuguese history great that Mouse

is sort of hung how does this affect me

in any way but what this actually means

is that they could replace their

president their entire Congress and huge

chunks of their state and local

governments and many believe a major

shift may be about to take place there

because Mexicans are sick and tired of

the status quo their current president's

approval rating sunk as low as 12

percent last year and has become very

common for people to shout a particular

phrase at him your ability Rozier

opinion evaluate genius of DC matter

[Applause]

Wow go your mother is something

people only shout at you when they are

angry nobody shouts it because they

think you and your mother have great

chemistry that's never happened so

tonight let's look at why people are so

angry at Mexico's current president

Enrique Pena Nieto and who they are

considering to replace him and if we're

honest most Americans don't really know

much about him for instance that's not

Pena Nieto that's just what came up when

we talked Mexican man into a stock

English side but as long as he's here

let's give this guy a spin look at him

go

the man is absolutely leaving it all on

the field look just just so either just

so you know this this is the real pena

nieto although he is also so handsome he

actually resembles a stock photo model

he was swept into office in 2012 on a

wave of hype he made the cover of Time

magazine with the headline saving Mexico

and us coverage of his election was

breathless dashing 45 year-old former

governor is married to a famous Mexican

soap opera star wherever the couple went

they drew huge crowds especially women

who despite the fact peanin Nieto was

married couldn't get enough of him

calling him bonbon which means sweet

thing or hottie

the fact he admitted cheating twice on

his first wife and bearing two children

out of wedlock before she died of

epilepsy didn't seem to faze the adoring

crowd yeah all of that is true and that

would be completely unforgivable if he

wasn't so violently attractive how are

you gonna stay mad at that he is

visually Acula and Pena Nieto's

election was dramatic for a number of

reasons his party the Institutional

Revolutionary Party or Prix had

previously enjoyed a 71 year long era of

one-party rule in Mexico which only

ended in 2000 so real multiparty

democracy is very much a new thing there

and for many the hope was that painting

the 8'o would clean up the party's image

and restore it to glory but to put it

mildly that did not happen he himself

was implicated in a number of

serious scandals and on his watch not

only did corruption not improve it hit

such a fever pitch that visitors to

Mexico City could do this this is the

corrupt tour a 90 minute bus ride to the

seamier side of Mexican business and

politics on its itinerary ten city

landmarks where public money has

allegedly been diverted for private gain

it's true there were actually bust tools

of Mexico's most appalling landmarks and

I sincerely hope that that tour includes

Guillermo del Toro's two Oscars for the

shape of water guess what guess what I

was rooting for the fish man to die the

first man was gross and I didn't enjoy

watching him and anyone who did is

weird and wrong but but for sheer the

sheer scale of government corruption in

Mexico is hard to comprehend many many

politicians have close ties to cartels

and gangs at least 14 current or former

governors of Mexican states are under

investigation for corruption some of

them for colluding with organized crime

like Xavier Duarte he's the governor of

Veracruz on his watch the state was

bankrupted with nearly three billion

dollars missing from official coffers

he's been charged with racketeering and

using illegally obtained funds among

other things and what he denies those

charges it frankly didn't look great

that he fled the country in a helicopter

only to be tracked down and arrested and

by the way what is that smile then that

is not the face a grown man makes after

being arrested that is the face a

nine-year-old makes after urinating in a

public pool and this pervasive

corruption contributes to a sense of

impunity and diminished faith in cops or

courts violence has spiked in Mexico

with the country on track for 32,000

murders this year twice as many as in

2014 and yet only 2% of crimes in Mexico

get solved which may explain why these

two Yayo fiends didn't seem to put much

effort into their disguises

and for many the incident that

encapsulates all of this frustration

government corruption violence and a

serious lack of accountability is what

happened on painting the ATO's watch in

2014 43 students disappeared September

26th after boarding a bus to the town of

Iguala to raise money for an upcoming

trip

authorities say the mayor there feared

the students would disrupt an event for

his wife and had police stopped down the

officers opened fire and turned the

students over to a drug gang which

killed them and burned their bodies it

was horrific and incredibly it got worse

than that because there is evidence that

the federal police and military were

involved in the students disappearances

but the government did not pursue it and

when you hear all of that you can sort

of understand why so many people want to

tell painting the 8'o

kinga tu madre now now he is not running

for re-election as Mexico's presents are

limited to one term so who are his

potential replacements well there is

Jose Antonio Mead also from the

pre-party but he has no chance we're not

going to talk about him

there is also Jaime Rodriguez and

independent candidates and state

governor known as el Bronco he also has

no chance but we're very much going to

talk about him because he is a human

wrecking ball just just watch his idea

for stopping government corruption your

could okay we need to cut off the hand

of anyone who steals in the public

service you're not speaking literally

are you candidate yes of course

literally well explain to me please

anyone who steals must have his hand cut

off a bill must be presented so that

members of Congress approved this

penalty cut off the hand of the

criminals of course that is what you're

gonna propose in the Congress that's

right god what a writer gave him five

separate chances to say that he wasn't

being serious

and he just Bronco his way through all

five of them and chopping off somebody's

hand is a pretty drastic punishment for

political corruption although a perfect

way to eliminate contestants from my new

reality competition show America's next

top sock puppeteer

I'm sorry Flopsy bunny just didn't Wow

Anthony please place your hand on the

chopping block

but but that is not el Broncos boldest

position because he also has a firm and

unwavering hatred of Santa Claus

I don't believe in Santa Claus do you

believe in Santa Claus how many believe

in Santa Claus look at just three Santa

Claus is bad it's true el Bronco hates

Santa and if you think we are cherry

picking just one example of virulent

anti-semitism think again when did you

tell your kids there was no Santa Claus

every day every day yeah he tells his

children every day that Santa is not

real that is harsh that is so hot

hello boys and girls it's me Santa

sorry to interrupt Santa I can't believe

you're here this is fantastic yes I just

wanted to tell Mexican presidential

candidate el Bronco that I do exist I

bring magic to children all over the

world so that el Bronco is on my naughty

list now if you'll excuse me I must get

back to the North Pole Oh actually

central I've always wondered what do you

do up there all year when you're not

delivering presents why I masturbate

dear boy I masturbate all day and night

I ask to beta masturbate until my sack

full of presents is empty if you catch

my meaning why would you say that Santa

every day is Christmas for Santa when he

masturbates I even do it sometimes when

I'm flying on my big red sleigh I try

not to get any on the reindeer but even

Santa's not perfect this is so different

than what I thought meeting you would be

like yeah yeah no no I get that a lot

I'm not sure why I mean look at me I'm

very weird and I love to stroke it till

it looks like a candy cane

[Music]

the pointed the point is el Bronco is

not going to be the next Mexican

president the the candidate currently

polling second is this guy

Ricardo Anaya a 39 year old center-right

wonk he is known for delivering

twenty-minute policy presentations that

are somehow even more explainer II than

the ones on this show the yellow line

shows the behavior of manufacturing

employment in the United States now as

you can clearly see it remains steady

despite NAFTA right we get on one hand

that was extremely boring but at least

we now know what it would look like if

pitbull went to grad school now Kylie

this guy is a bit of a nerd although he

does desperately try to be cool because

he plays a bunch of musical instruments

he plays guitar he plays ukulele he

plays keyboard and the coolest

instrument of all the recorder that is

simply pathetic and it is not just me

saying that in Mexico that clip is

unleased what's been called a tsunami of

memes including videos where people swap

in different songs like this version of

Britney Spears toxic

[Music]

[Applause]

muy bien where he go or even muy bien

now now I know I did try and toughen his

image opportu in the campaign but he

struggled to stick the landing like when

he released this video ahead of a debate

what are you doing just hitting that

speed bag his teddy will impressive but

you then ruined it with that weird smile

at the end

he's like someone successfully pulling

the cloth from underneath a table

setting and then immediately pissing

their pants he was so close you

ruined it though but the outright

front-runner and the man widely expected

to win this election is Andres Manuel

Lopez Obrador a populist who often goes

by his initials am lo and he served as

mayor of Mexico City a building a

reputation as a man of the people

famously commuting to work in a Nissan

Sentra the vehicle rated by JD Power and

Associates this is actually amylose

third time running for president he lost

in 2006 and 2012 not taking that first

loss particularly well cuz not only did

he refuse to accept the results he held

a gigantic alternative inauguration

ceremony in Mexico City in which he was

sworn in with a fake sash and declared

himself the legitimate President of

Mexico his supporters occupied the city

central square for months and that is

ridiculous when Al Gore lost the 2000

election he didn't hold a fake

inauguration he just told us we were all

gonna die and it was our fault it was

it was just called basic good

sportsmanship

now look I'm lost campaign has caught

fire this time around because he has

tapped into populist anger he's promised

to help the poor and eradicate

corruption and he often rails against

the elites and the Mafia in power

oh why you have been sir okay so more he

Wireless Kalos political caucus solo

they see less hero Martha Corinne tan

your chant all of public yes Thank You

Moira

we are say Gila chant por la gente per

mil de por la gente he says he doesn't

look that sounds great and you can kind

of see the appeal there am low is kind

of like Bernie Sanders but with a better

haircut and significantly better Spanish

Washington Roscoe a goldman sachs ER

Wall Street they sue Barker otter

obviously think he could have carried a

hundred percent of the Hispanic vote if

his slogan had been vote for me and I

will never speak Spanish again am lows

goals may be clear but but the details

of how he plans to achieve them can be

pretty sketchy his opponents of attacked

him as a dangerous leftist but

journalists who've covered him say it's

hard to judge things based on his policy

platforms because they're prone to

change often seemingly overnight and

that he often makes big promises while

keeping his own advisers guessing as to

what he really means so in that way he's

actually more reminiscent of a Mexican

Donald Trump which I know is a weird

image to conjure up like Orthodox Hitler

or jacked Gandhi the two concepts don't

fit well together but but but the lack

of concrete policy hasn't dampened the

excitement around AMLO who supporters of

made some pretty striking ads for Garvey

salos politico's cortos campo bernardo

and Ostrow Pais get each other Mickey

Cohen a fabrica recoveries and

don't see holes and thicker than no

clean emir of seniors damn holy

that is the most terrifying Tiger I've

seen since the episode of Winnie the

Pooh where Tigger ate eel and was that

really so put their wild animals

Christopher Robin you can't just keep

them in your backyard it was bound to

happen sooner or later not a tragedy

that was inevitable but that that ad

actually becomes less fun when you

learned that it was made by the social

encounter party an evangelical Christian

party that opposes same-sex marriage

homosexuality and abortion that party is

in am Lowe's coalition which kind of

speaks to the fact that by being so

vague he can let people see what they

want to see in him so sure a Christian

conservative party can think that he's

on their side as can be presumably much

more liberal people behind this ad which

pitches am low as an aphrodisiac

paulien skip let's give away what our

poor undressed man we're just a meeting

is insidious most sexually explicit

campaign ad since Theodore Roosevelt's

famous slogan of teddy will make you

but the point here is what our hope in

AMLO is real the content is a question

mark and it says something about how

entrenched the problems in Mexico are

and the level of people's

dissatisfaction that they seemed so

willing to take a gamble on him and look

for much of this piece we've talked

about the problems in Mexico of which

there are many but that is what makes it

all the more impressive the people are

putting their lives on the line to solve

them there are journalists tackling

corruption despite the fact that Mexico

is the third deadliest country in the

world for them to work after Iraq and

Syria and there are honest politicians

running for office

even though 120 politicians including 44

candidates have been killed during this

campaign in the town of Piedras Negras

an anti cartel congressional candidate

was murdered just earlier this month but

but the mayor there is refusing to hide

we reached the current mayor of the

others named as Sonia via Reyes who says

her life was threatened just rude asses

no Tina still more of these are you

you're not fearing them no Wow porque

you are shocked even if it means risking

your life doesn't happen I mean that is

just amazing and and for the record I am

NOT that brave I am NOT that brave at

all sure oh took the drug cartels

from the safety of New York this this

produces the actual head of the Sinaloa

cartel and I'll happily say that he

looks like Andy Garcia won a pizza

eating contest cuz that guy

him I'm not scared of him but I wouldn't

have the courage to say that in Mexico

and

I wouldn't even have the courage to say

it here that's not the head of the

Sinaloa cartel

that's another stock photo do you think

I'm crazy the point here is

Mexico is on the verge of the biggest

election in their history with a chance

to combat endemic corruption that has

betrayed its people for far too long and

I sincerely hope the candidates they

choose at every level are worthy of the

trust that's about to be placed in them

because it's going to take brave bold

work to give that country to change it

needs Santa Claus is not coming to save

Mexico as we learn tonight that man is

very busy

don't do what vividly describe how I

bring myself to climax 364 days out of

the year I concur in my toy shop John I

fill my stocking I polish the North Pole

the elves taught me yoga and now I can

blow myself

you

sexual harassment in the workplace which

you may know from its supporting role on

the hit show Mad Men and look who better

to talk about it than me a man

when will the male perspective on

harassment be heard the public has been

crying out well wait no longer tonight

is the night we've been dealing with

workplace harassment for decades as

demonstrated by this unfortunately

titled training video from 1981 what's

wrong with that huh everything is a

matter of fact when it's unwelcome and

when it occurs at work okay so first

never call it good old sex you sound

like a grandfather explaining the birds

and the bees let's talk about good old

sex tiger because sometimes pop up likes

to stick the old spatula in me Moore's

Easy Bake Oven you get it you get it the

kid gets it but but the fact is the fact

is store brands Ted Danson is right

workplace harassment is something

important to discuss and it's been in

the headlines again this week with the

New Yorkers expose a about CBS and les

Moonves coming hot on the heels of

similar investigations into everyone

from Harvey Weinstein to Charlie Rose to

SpongeBob who five different employees

accused of being unable to keep his

sponge dick in his SquarePants

you're a monster whenever the subject of

workplace harassment comes up you can

bet on one thing men getting very

nervous I think right now men are scared

and you could get to a point where women

are gonna be denied opportunities to

advance in corporate America because men

don't want to be alone with a woman

don't want to be in the same office as a

woman I'm so scared to look at a woman

I'm so scared to compliment a woman I'm

so scared to even a hug woman because I

better have a big enough bank account

for her to turn around and file a

complaint or file a lawsuit against me

huh I'm starting to be concerned that

innocent people are afraid of being hurt

and that's a bad sign and so the

question is what are the rules how do we

find out what they are how do you know

if you're guilty what is going on you

know you know you can tell so much about

a question from the mayor tone with

which it is asked because what are the

rules is not inherently a bad question

to ask if you want to know the answer

are the rules sounds more like an

erections temper tantrum but but but the

point here is it does seem like we're on

the verge of a national reckoning about

sexual harassment major companies like

Ford have had to pay multi-million

dollar settlements and promised to

change their corporate culture a wave of

women are now running for office in

what's being called the year of the

woman and times up was even a theme of

this year's Oscars show now

unfortunately everything I just said

also describes the 1990s when powerful

companies like Ford paid out

multi-million dollar settlements and

promised to change their culture and a

wave of women ran for office in 1992

prompting it to be called the year of

the woman and that theme was the back

job of the next year's Oscars featuring

this moment

[Music]

I just

[Music]

we'll leave

[Music]

ouch the only way that could be anymore

on the nose is if after they sang

Hillary will lead the way Donald Trump

came on stage grew up to the backup

dancers and somehow won best picture

despite losing the popular votes

national conversation in the 90s was

largely kick-started by the experience

of this woman and if you are too young

to remember who that is first enjoy

snapchatting your student loan avocado

toast or whatever it is you people do

and secondly that is that is Anita Hill

she was compelled to testify before the

Senate Judiciary Committee in the

confirmation hearings of Judge Clarence

Thomas and she informed them that when

she twerks for him years before she'd

been repeatedly harassed she gave a

detailed account of inappropriate

behavior from unwanted advances to

Thomas bragging about the size of his

own penis to an infamous story about a

pubic hair in a coke can which is the

most disgusting thing you could possibly

discover in a coke can other than Pepsi

and and while enough senators believed

Thomas's denials to confirm him the

terrible treatment that Anita Hill

received during the hearings inspired a

nationwide effort to stop workplace

harassment once and for all now clearly

that did not work so tonight since we

seem to be going in circles on this

issue let's try and at least talk about

it if only because no one wants to see

ending workplace harassment as the

unofficial theme of the 2048 Oscars

hosted by a somehow still ageless Paul

Rudd and let's just start with one of

those basic questions that Tucker Carson

wind into his camera what are the rules

it's something that continues to confuse

people despite all those shitty training

video showing examples of a dangerous

office culture have you seen the new

blonde secretary over at shipping

to see the file man listen of you boys

are impressed with her typing and filing

wait until she takes your dictation

[Music]

now I realize this isn't necessarily the

most relevant criticism of that man's

behavior but he just left without

washing his hands that was that was just

zero daylight between the time his

fingers adjust if his colleagues necktie

and the time they adjusted his own penis

but but but the questions what is sexual

harassment actually does have an answer

because while companies may have their

own policies from a legal standpoint

sexual harassment is considered a form

of employment discrimination just like

discrimination on the basis of race or

age it becomes unlawful when it is

severe or pervasive enough that it

creates a hostile environment or when it

includes a quid pro quo meaning

employees have to enjoy the harassment

or risk losing their jobs so that is

what constitutes sexual harassment under

the law it's not a single shitty joke or

a botched compliment it's going out of

your way to make someone else's work day

a psychosexual nightmare but of course

behavior doesn't have to be illegal to

be inappropriate anytime that you're

making someone else uncomfortable that's

gonna be a problem and some of this

involves judgment and consideration so

is a hug okay well in certain situations

maybe I would argue if it's from behind

never incidentally is a hug okay is

Britain's top selling sex ed book and

the answer is simply no the problem is

some people have decided to handle the

complexity of this issue not by

modifying their behavior but by

modifying their staff and I will let

instantly exhausting Easter Island head

Tony Robbins the author of the book the

worst person you know is currently

reading this I'll let him explain

tonight Tony Robbins taking heat after

these comments

robbing saying some men in Hollywood now

afraid to hire women what are you

talking about Tony you do get them

that's not a story about a problem with

the me to move it right that's a story

about a man who shouldn't be allowed to

have employees at all you you probably

think Jeffrey Dahmer was just the victim

of dangerous men and boys who walked

around all day being too edible now this

thing is unfortunately arguments like

that can slow down any movement towards

finding real solutions and too often

aspersions are cast on anyone coming

forward from they're just doing it to

get rich - they're just doing it for

revenge - why are they coming forward

now and it is strange that we go there

so quickly because that just doesn't

happen with other traumatic events if

your house burnt down you wouldn't

expect a newscaster to immediately start

asking what are you coming forward now

was this insurance fraud wish your house

wearing something flammable and is it

even on fire at all because where is the

line between fire and not fire anymore

it's so hard to tell I'm terrified to be

around houses anymore but with sexual

harassment that is so often where these

conversation immediately goes with

immediate concern less for the victim

and more for the accused there is no due

process right now right now accusation

allegation goodbye everybody gets fired

I wonder if you destroy men or complete

the destruction of men there they're

pretty close to being destroyed I would

say how's it up women exactly it's true

it's absolutely true men are destroyed

it is the end of man women are taking us

down and even worse they even worship

monsters now now that all the

Ghostbusters are women that means that

when we die we'll spend all of eternity

being destroyed by more women it's not

and look look the court of public

opinion

is far from an ideal place to deal with

individual claims but it's worth

considering why son who've been harassed

feel the need to speak publicly publicly

because it often has to do with the fact

that we have a piecemeal inadequate

process for addressing the issue

privately the law requires you to first

go through the EEOC before you can file

an employment discrimination lawsuit and

they are notoriously difficult to win

and while state laws vary if you work

for a business with less than 15

employees there is no federal remedy for

workplace sexual harassment not and

let's say you don't want to file a

lawsuit maybe you like many people don't

don't even want your harasser to be

fired you just want the bad behavior to

stop that is where a company's HR

department might come in but people can

be reluctant to go to HR for

understandable reasons HR exists to

protect the company from liability not

necessarily to seek justice on an

employee's behalf and all those guys

that you just saw complaining about due

process should really know this because

they work out Fox News where harassment

allegations are so rampant that their

biggest stars have been dropping like

suspects in an Agatha Christie novel

there were there were multiple

allegations against Bill O'Reilly after

which their parent company responded no

current or former Fox News employee ever

took advantage of the 21st Century Fox

hotline to raise a concern about him and

maybe that is because those women knew

that the huge power disparity between

them and O'Reilly was unlikely to work

in their favor though this is something

that was actually pointed out to our

Riley

but perhaps the single worst person

imaginable every allegation in this area

is a conviction they don't look for the

truth think about those five women and

what they did they came forward and

filed complaints against the biggest

star at the network they worked at think

of how intimidating that must have been

how nerve-racking that must have been

doesn't that tell you how strongly they

felt about the way they were treated by

you wow that is an admirable

confrontational question Matt Lauer

you've really backed him into a corner

pressured him into giving you what you

want

locked the door behind him

metaphorically of course

metaphorically of course but but as we

now know the absence of calls to a

hotline does not mean an absence of

systemic sexual harassment and while

bill o'reilly denied the allegations

against him he reportedly settled one of

them for thirty two million dollars

thirty two million dollars to one person

and that's where the negotiations ended

up and a figure slightly more than the

production budget of lala land o'reilly

allegedly engaged in a lala lands worth

of harassment so if nobody called fox's

HR hotline that might be a problem with

their HR hotline and when you

combine a toxic workplace with a lack of

confidence in systems of accountability

bad things can happen just look at the

US forest service where women have been

coming forward describing a boys club

atmosphere rife with harassment and

retaliation just listen to one employee

explain what she went through in filing

a complaint i wanted justice but i

wasn't like in it for some personal

vendetta i don't want this to happen to

other women and i don't want him to do

it like in the future her complete

detailed several instances of

inappropriate physical contact

once he rubbed her butt another time it

was her inner thigh another time he

grabbed her breasts put his hand between

her legs and groped her two months later

the Forest Service sent her a letter it

said an investigation against

allegations of misconduct was conducted

and we found that there was no

misconduct and so then it just feels

like you're like screaming into a void

like this happened and nobody hears that

or believes that were they hear it and

don't believe it at all that is very

depressing and honestly I can't even say

on that surprise that the Forest Service

is a hotbed of sexual misconduct what

sort of government agency routinely

allows an employee to show up to work

without wearing a shirt and I do not

want to hear the excuse Oh Smokies our

bear of course he doesn't have a shirt

he has

personalized hat and belt that our soul

is wise to shirts put one on and look

look the point is it's not about him the

point is she is not alone Abbi bot a

battalion chief with the Forest Service

was sexually assaulted while on

assignment and while she did tell the

police she didn't press charges and her

description of why she felt she couldn't

tell her bosses about the incident is

just heartbreaking

watching somebody that would file a

complaint or make a complaint

immediately became the problem and you

know we have the term that girl or those

girls I don't want to be one of those

girls you know I've I've introduced

myself that way to people before like

hey I'm now you don't worry I'm not one

of those girls or one of those girls

being someone who simply says that

behavior is wrong let's do something

about it exactly I was I was trained

that way my whole don't be one of those

girls that is just terrible and the

culture that she's describing is way too

similar to the culture that we thought

we could work to eliminate the last time

we had a big conversation about this

back in 1991 with Anita Hill and re

watching the Senate debate about her now

it is depressing

how many of the techniques used to

undermine her are still around today

from concern over false allegations to

blame the victim to outright character

assassination let me tell you the law of

sexual harassment is so broad that a

person can accuse another at any time

and and and ruin their reputation just

by a unfounded allegation how could you

allow this kind of reprehensible conduct

to go on right in the headquarters

without doing something about it

I really am getting stuff over the

transom about professor hill I've got

letters hanging out in my pocket I've

got faxes statements from Tulsa Oklahoma

saying watch out for this woman but

nobody's got the guts to say that

because it gets all tangled up in this

sexual harassment crap literally the

only parts of that montage that would

sound at all out of place today are the

words transom and the concept of faxes

again for young people a fax is like if

it it's like if a text message a

telegram a telegram is like you know

what young people never mind go back to

your avocados but the tragic fact here

is what we've made progress some

progress regarding workplace harassment

since then we clearly haven't come far

enough so what can we do well I would

say the first step for both management

and employees is awareness of the

problem the next is for companies to

develop workable internal mechanisms to

deal with sexual harassment and for

employees to change those behavior

patterns which might contribute to it

change is in the air though now now that

we know this form of discrimination

exists we must put an end to it you know

what I think we will and and I'd love to

say I believe that but remember that

good old sex video that I showed you

earlier the one from 1981 this is how it

ended the first step for both management

and employees is awareness of the

problem the next is for companies to

develop workable internal mechanisms to

deal with sexual harassment and for

employees to change those behavior

patterns which might contribute to it

change is in the air now that we know

this form of discrimination exists we

must put an end to it

and we will yes spoiler alert we didn't

and now I'm saying the same thing it's

like the movie Groundhog Day and just

like that movie there's entirely too

much unacknowledged workplace harassment

happening in plain view

she's your producer bill and it's always

her first day look look the the large

point here is time was supposed to be up

in 1981 and 1991 and now time is

supposed to be up again will this go

around be any different I honestly don't

know but I do know an expert in this

field

that may have some suggestions take a

look in 1991 Anita Hill testified for

eight hours in front of the Senate

Judiciary Committee enduring humiliating

questions from a panel of world-class

assholes she's now a professor at

Brandeis University and was kind enough

to meet with me professor Hill thank you

so much for sitting down with me thank

you it's good to be here so it has been

27 years since you testified in front of

the Senate what has changed in that time

oh there's been a tremendous amount of

change

there's been a change in public attitude

and there's been a change in the amount

of information that we have about sexual

harassment there's certainly more

awareness after me to impose my even a

few years ago people were ambivalent

about what the consequences should be if

someone is behaving incredibly badly and

abusing people they work well I guess

the problem is there that awareness of a

problem doesn't necessarily make

something better I've been aware of

Coldplay for years but that hasn't

seemed to help the issue go away you're

right people were aware of it but there

was no consensus on what should we do

about that you've suggested you can fix

the women you can fix the guys or you

can change the culture and if we fix the

guys and change the culture we won't

need to fix the women that's right

you know that and that's so far much of

the approaches we've had is to put all

of the burden on living one of the

questions I got this sort of six out of

me is you know how do we raise our

daughter to make sure that she doesn't

set herself up to be a victim of sexual

harassment these are the kinds of things

that we're thinking okay we fix her then

she won't encounter this problem in a

reality that's she is not the problem so

let's talk about man I'm a man in the

broadest possible sense of the word

let's talk about men's role regarding

trying to fix sexual harassment do men

have a role in that discussion yes oh

that's good yes it's nice to be needed

oh you are need it we need you to step

up I'll realize at this point in time

there are no innocent bystanders if you

are aware of something you acknowledge

it you know it's wrong but you don't do

anything about it then it's the same as

participating at it is it worth trying

to spot some of the more disingenuous

questions out there because one of the

refrains you hear a lot is where's the

line but it seems like that's often in

search of an answer that will identify

exactly how close

to the line they can possibly get so

even eight-second hug is unacceptable I

say great on doing a seven and a half

second hug and I'm filling it with as

much creepiness as I can and

unfortunately to some extent the law has

allowed that to happen that you know it

was bad but it wasn't quite bad enough

it was a seven missus it yeah and so and

maybe they didn't even realize that they

were getting close to the AIDS seconds

affected say you know not good with

numbers

the law has tolerated that so part of

the change has to be with the law you

know one of the things that so often

happens is that the law around

discrimination relies on intent did they

intend to harm you well you know if

you're a victim it doesn't matter so

much whether they intended well you did

might not have intended to hit me with

your car but you hit me and and that

means that there are repercussions in

consequences regardless of what your

intent was we've seen a lot of men

saying they're absolutely terrified to

be alone with a woman now should they be

scared not if they're not harasses

rights should be terrified and you

should stop not do that you know the

whole idea of false claims there's

something it is another one of those

roadblocks that people throw out well

that that really hasn't manifested

itself that doesn't mean that it never

happens but they're so rare and it seems

to me that we don't need to make rules

around the things that rarely happen

until we've finished up making the rules

around the things that are happening

regularly there are men afraid that if

they're accused they're just going to

wind up being dragged in front of some

kind of tribunal with their whole

private life up for a view against

people who think they're lying no matter

what they say and in the process of

doing that their life could be

completely turned upside down can you

Anita Hill even imagine what that might

feel

yeah yeah it's actually not imaginative

actually have had my life turned upside

down oh yeah yeah so let's go back to

1991 you were cool to appear before the

Senate Judiciary Committee and it seems

like you had a set of expectations of

how that would go and that those

expectations were in a very real sense

not met was there a point during that

eight hours that you found yourself

thinking really this is what today is

gonna be there was a point where they

they said something about well what

procedure would you like to be put in

place I'm a witness I'm on the witness

stand I'm trying to testify and I

thought so they really don't know what

they're doing

it's amazed you show superhuman levels

of restraint during that day but there

was still moments where it feels like

you can read not just frustration but

like seething contempt on your face a

moment wait could be projecting this but

you were about to tell Orrin Hatch to go

see I'm not if you had it would

have been entirely justified I think any

of reactions that I have now it sort of

hindsight I felt like I was entitled to

I will also add that in terms of my

display of contempt you know I've lived

through a lot of challenges and having

questions thrown at me to challenge my

competency as a woman as a woman of

color and so much of what I heard that

day was familiar in tone the questions

were different but the tone was really

something that was all too familiar you

were accused at the time like women are

accused now of coming forward to get

rich and famous how did that work

helpful yes well some people would say

that I am infamous

so it certainly worked

and that way to the extent that I ever

wanted to be famous or rich I had a plan

for doing that that would not have

involved the hurt and harm that was done

not only to myself but certainly to my

friends and family and the people who

were behind me so so let's talk about

exes historically

whenever sexual harassment comes to the

fore in culture it seems like we think

about it just long enough to feel like

we've addressed it but not quite long

enough to actually address it what are

the ways that we can tackle the problem

of workplace harassment well one of the

things that we need to do to change the

culture and actually convince people you

know we're serious about it

is to publicize the policies and to

inform people this is what happens if

you file a complaint here are the things

that you will do here are the questions

that you will face here is the process I

also think that there are some

management things that we can do we for

example can do bystander training

because I still some of them are saying

wow I don't know what to do but I think

back now to myself in the workplace over

the years now I can't honestly say that

I consistently spoke up if I saw creepy

behavior especially when I was much

younger and I felt that I was on the

lower end of a power dynamic and didn't

necessarily feel empowered to speak out

and say that's wrong that's a pretty

poor excuse but but it's probably how I

felt at the time how should I feel about

myself

looking back other than just slightly

ashamed slightly ashamed is a good start

that's a very fun way to put it that was

that same actual shame would be at the

very least the destination you would aim

for cool you know sometimes shame is

helpful sometimes shaming is not helpful

it just makes people feel guilty and

maybe even resentful so we you know you

have to hear it this at a moment where

people feel empathetic and not just

embarrassing shame or shamed of

themselves

if you want to go back to some of the

situations just pick one yeah what would

you do now

I can't probably just say that was a

pretty creepy thing to do right that's a

really nice sort of manly thing to do

but would you might you also say to the

person who is getting the brunt of this

and say you know how are you

right how does this feel to you would

you like for me to say something yeah

it's kind of sad that that's not

instinctively actually well there is sad

a reaction okay how optimistic can you

allow yourself to be right now in terms

of how things are gonna change I'm

certainly more optimistic than I was 27

years ago that's a low ball that's a

very low price but even then I was

somewhat optimistic because I have seen

people step up I've heard from women

whose lives have been changed because

things happen differently when they went

forward with their complaint and they

would have expected it to happen years

before so I am I'm hopeful when do you

think this problem will finally be fixed

do you think I'll be wrapped up before

or after the ice caps are gone I'm just

trying to work out whether a safe

workplace and polar bears are mutually

exclusive well the ice caps are melting

pretty fast okay and the change here

seems to be glacially slow right but I

will say that if we do nothing the

change that's not gonna come I need zeal

thanks so much for talking with us

thank you

[Applause]

Donald Trump a man whose presidential

library could conceivably exhibit a

Razzie award seriously

he won a Razzie in 1991 for his

supporting role in the film ghosts can't

do it as a businessman negotiating with

bo Derek in this room there are knives

sharp enough to cut you to the bone

in hearts cold enough to eat yours as

hors d'oeuvres you're too pretty to be

bet that kissy face is the single most

disgusting thing that's ever been in a

movie and I'm very much including the

human centipede

we're not going to talk about Trump's

movie career tonight instead we want to

focus on the two-year anniversary of one

of his signature campaign promises we

are going to drain the swamp in

Washington DC it's time to drain the

swamp of corruption drain the swamp look

at that sign drain the swamp we're gonna

drain the swamp of Washington we're

gonna have fun doing it we're all doing

it together

we're gonna have fun doing it and we're

all doing it together sounds less like a

campaign promise and more like a nervous

host rambling through the introduction

of their first ever orgy so we're gonna

have fun doing it and we're all doing it

together and thanks without overspread

Tom oh we said no names didn't we

don't really don't really dominate

everybody now behind the coffee

table and look limiting the power of

industry lobbyists and special interest

is a genuinely good idea

and what I would love to give him credit

the odds are if your whole political

platform is just screaming random three

word phrases one of them is gonna bound

to end up being good lock her up no

build the wall no all dogs ooh stop

that's actually a great idea it took a

while but you finally threw out a good

one well Trump by no means came up with

that phrase he clearly caught on after

he won because other candidates began

using it and perhaps not more memorably

or literally from this guy I'm barb gray

an outsider and a biz

I'm running to fuel the economy choke

off wasteful spending and secure our

nation but most importantly I promise to

drain the swamps

right except you're not really draining

the swamp so much as you are moving it a

couple of feet off-camera and scooch the

swamp it just doesn't quite have the

same ring to it does it but as much as

people have taken to Trump's drained the

swamp promise it won't remotely surprise

you to know that he has not drained the

swamp even one little bit

his capita has included many swamp

creatures from these two goldman sachs

veterans working on tax policy Gary Cohn

and certified handful of man-candy Steve

Minuten to Wilbur Ross commerce

secretary wealthy corporate raider and

living worst-case scenario what can

happen when Wallace Shawn is not stored

at the proper temperature Trump has a

laughable number of wealthy businessmen

presiding over policies that could

directly benefit themselves and their

former employers and incredibly despite

drain the swamp being one of trumps

greatest hits at his rallies many of his

supporters do not seem troubled by this

the swamp is horrible and Trump is there

he's there for the small guy he's there

for people like myself though his

cabinet is filled with multimillionaires

I love that they're not politicians and

you don't see them as part of the swamp

who are not a little eyes on the system

in in in a capitalist system you're

allowed to make money being rich is good

yeah so then what is the swamp just want

for me mainstream is is yes you almost

nailed it it's the mainstream it's the

elite that looked down on a small guy

like myself okay first if you're

mainstream you can't be elite by

definition elites are a select group

superior to the mainstream those terms

are mutually exclusive digging into this

logical fallacy makes me sound like an

elitist asshole it does not make me

sound like a mainstream our soul do you

see what I mean second second

and perhaps most importantly the narrow

question of self enrichment is only part

of why the swamp is a problem a much

bigger issue is the harm that can that

it can actually do and that is what our

story is about tonight because real

damage is being done to these small guy

by this administration's actions take

payday lending as we've discussed on

this show before people's lives can be

destroyed by misleadingly marketed high

interest loans but the new acting head

of the Consumer Financial Protection

Bureau Mick Mulvaney has been actively

working with the payday loan industry to

block rules reining them in why would he

do that I don't know what I do know is

that as a congressman he got sixty

thousand dollars in campaign

contributions from payday lending

interests and earlier this year he told

a roomful of bankers this amusing

anecdote

we had a hierarchy in my office in

Congress if you're a lobbyist who never

gave us money I didn't talk to you if

you're a lobbyist who gave us money I

might talk to you now he did say he

would always talk to constituents

whether they gave him money or not but

the fact Molly he's admitting that as a

lobbyist money might get you a meeting

you don't often hear that from a

politician yeah you actually don't I

mean it's something that everyone

naturally assumes but it is weird to

hear it out loud it's like at Disney

World Park attendants saying hey kids

who must have their photo taken with a

30 year old theater major who couldn't

hack it in the industry and who now

wears a full-body Mouse suit I mean

there's no new information there but it

is still unpleasant to listen to but

just focusing on the famous alligators

in Trump's swamp is missing some of the

most important damage that's getting

done by lesser-known bureaucrats and to

illustrate that let's look at two

agencies tonight first the EPA now for a

year it was run by Scott Pruitt who

became a household name for doing things

like spending forty thousand dollars on

a soundproof booth in his office trying

to get the CEO of chick-fil-a to give

his wife a franchise and demanding an

expensive 24/7 security detail then

making it drive him around town to see

which ritz-carlton had the lotion he

lights which is simply insane because

everyone knows the best lotion comes

from La Quinta Inn that's right if you

want to masturbate with Hotel lotion

choose lakita is

their slogan says like who has the

lotion that will help you juice once

those chronic left there were not as

many flashy headlines about the EPA but

that itself is actually dangerous

because he was not an isolated case

nearly half of the political appointees

hired by Trump at the EPA have strong

industry ties and the guy who replaced

Pruitt is not much of an improvement

the man tapped to be Pruitt's

replacement andrew wheeler a man who

Forbes says earned more than $700,000 in

recent years as wait for it a call

obvious yeah

at this point though CNN you really

don't need to ask the American people to

wait for it

surprise is just one more emotion that

Trump has completely destroyed along

with joy Wonder and the ability to see

someone wearing a red hat from behind

without mentally saying god dammit we

pushed hard to roll back environmental

regulations impacting the industry in

fact here he is as a lobbyist meeting

with Rick Perry doing exactly that and

little over a year later he is running

the EPA and dismantling the very

regulations he lobbies against which is

ridiculous he's like handing your cities

waste management over to a seagull so

let me get this straight

the new strategies we just throw our

trash everywhere and leave it strewn

around and we should have more french

fries in our garbage how the are

you in charge but but wheeler wheeler is

actually a really good example of how

once Trump's swamp starts seeping in it

can filter all the way down an

organization and for just how deep it

can go simply look at the Department of

the Interior on this show we've lavished

quite a bit of attention on Trump's

appointee to head them Ryan's inky which

is understandable he rode a horse to

work on his first day at the department

he swung Karen pence around like a bag

of potatoes and despite the fact that he

is very much not a geologist he has a

weird habit of doing this that's the

questionnaire Sonoma geologist I'm a

geologist I'm a geologist I'm a

geologist I'm a geologist

he's not a geologist at all

besides bragging about Vienna College is

a very weird boat it's just like walking

around saying I own crackers saltines

cheese's you name it I own it not oyster

crackers of course Who am I Bill Gates

Zinke has also taken 66 personal days in

his first year and a half on the job and

has been the subject of no less than 15

investigations and reportedly he may

actually be gone any day now

but even if that happens serious

problems will remain because the swamp

runs deep interior is a massive

department and there is real power at

every level I'll show you

look at this organizational chart below

Zinke and the deputy secretary and the

assistant secretary for land and

minerals management you will find a very

important subdivision called the bureau

of safety and environmental enforcement

or Besse which is in charge of safety on

offshore oil rigs and I know what you're

thinking

safety on offshore oil rigs wouldn't

recognize the oversight of any resource

development on the outer continental

shelf fall under the jurisdiction of the

minerals management service but wouldn't

that be where the responsibility lies

John to which I say congratulations on

being a sex God and you know what you're

right you're right

the minerals management service actually

used to be in charge of safety until

2010 when there was that catastrophe at

deepwater horizon this is the video BP

did not want the world to see

toxic blend of oil and gas spewing from

its broken well at the bottom of the

Gulf of Mexico yes the Deepwater Horizon

famously pumped over 130 million gallons

of oil into the Gulf of Mexico about 12

times the size of the Exxon Valdez spill

costing the region billions and badly

hurting the fishing and tourism

industries and you know you know it was

a disaster because Mark Wahlberg made a

movie about it and he usually chooses

historic films about the most absolutely

appalling things stuff like tragic

shipwrecks acts of terrorism and Mel

Gibson's seamless reintegration into

Hollywood

and and he's years after two ports on

horizon

the reason was still feeling the effects

when the little boys fish in this area

right here Papa woody catches the pond

really half and and what kind of

deformities

they got tumors on the head a little

bumped off the sod it's all in the gills

where they breathe that all in

there so that's oil and gills

yeah if you take this shell off you

could pull all our you get smelling yeah

that's horrible

not only did that spill devastate an

economy it's somehow actually managed to

make shrimp even more disgusting and I

hate shrimp

they are slimy armored alien bugs but

improper preparation involves pulling

out their shits Bane there is not enough

cocktail sauce in the world to erase the

memory of a ship vain and yet somehow

that oil spill made them even grosser

now now before Deepwater Horizon the

Minerals Management Service was in

charge of both safety on oil rigs and

collecting revenues from all companies

which was clearly a bad idea because it

was an obvious conflict of interest so

after deepwater they created Bessy an

agency whose only job is to keep people

and the environment safe that is their

sole responsibility promotion of

drilling in the Gulf that is someone

else's job

Bessie's is safety that is all they do

that is probably why it's last two heads

were a former Coast Guard officer

specializing in marine safety and a

former Coast Guard officer specializing

in marine safety however Trump has taken

a different path appointing Scott

Angelle former lieutenant governor of

Louisiana and a guy who is aggressively

pro drilling for a sense of just how

aggressive he is just days after the

Deepwater well was capped our shale was

at a rally organized by the Louisiana

Oil & Gas Association where he called

for an immediate resumption of deep-sea

drilling saying this enough is enough

and it's time to quit punishing innocent

American workers to achieve some

unrealistic political agenda while we to

support the use of renewable and

alternative energy let's keep the

conversation real America is not yet

ready to get all of its fuel from the

birds and the bees

the flowers and the trees ha ha

America is not yet ready to get fuel

from trees

you mean wood scientists have understood

how wood works for years now maybe even

decades but after serving as lieutenant

governor I shall join the board of

Sunoco logistics partners and oil

pipeline company earning nearly a

million dollars and now he's regulating

the oil industry and if there is any

doubt about his priorities which there

is not just wait until you see something

we found on YouTube because last year

ours y'all gave a presentation at an oil

industry conference where he was flanked

by two men one in a hardhat both of whom

were eating during a significant portion

of his speech but that is not the

important part the incredible Rodgers is

when he makes it painfully clear exactly

how accessible he the man in charge of

enforcing safety remember is willing to

be to industry leaders Marcel number

ears anybody wants to give me a call to

talk about it my cell numbers five seven

one five eighty five thirty seven thirty

five seven one five eighty five thirty

seven thirty I'd rather you call me

everything you texted me is a public

record so be careful this is a business

opportunity for you to engage with me on

what you believe we ought to be about

holy he just gave out his work cell

phone number and encouraged all bosses

to call him on it as a business

opportunity that is outrageous for two

reasons first because he's doing that to

avoid the public record and second no

one should ever call rather than text I

don't care what the scenario is if you

prefer calling to texting you're a

psychopath and you should be put

in prison forever

detect whatever the situation and that

is his real number we know because we

called it and apparently he gives it out

publicly to executives all the time and

another industry conference he even

announced it from a stage and who knows

what those executives tell him it's not

part of the public record but by sheer

coincidence he urged the White House to

loosen safety requirements implemented

in the wake of Deepwater Horizon which

they are now planning to do and which

his estimating could save all companies

nearly a billion dollars over the next

decade which is the most shocking ten

digit number I've heard since five seven

one five eight five 3730 so it's at this

point that Trump has a no way drains the

swamp what he has done is drained the

phrase of its original meaning and in

fairness to him he was pretty

transparent from the beginning about how

little he meant it

this is him just one month after his

election essentially telling everyone to

their faces that the phrase was

meaningless funny how that term car

owners do I taught I tell every I hated

it so what he said drained his swamp I

said oh that's so hokey that is so

terrible I said alright I'll try it so

like a month ago I said drain the swamp

place went crazy I said whoa what's this

then I said it again then I started

saying it like I meant it right and then

I said it I said loving it and the place

loved it strained the swamp it made it's

true it's true it's true

it isn't it isn't it isn't Trump never

meant drain the swamp and you can tell

that by what has happened since because

he promised to clean up DC and instead

the guy in charge of the CFPB is holding

hands with loan sharks the EPA might as

well be run by a sentient piece of coal

and his head of oil rig safety what's

the industry to blow up his digits like

an under regulated oil well all in all

it seems like if there is anyone

remaining who is still hoping that Trump

might drain the swamp

you can now officially kissy-face that

idea of goodbye

you

Brazil home of that one famous statue

that I don't know the name of because

I'm too embarrassed to Google come at me

bro Jesus statue we we tend to think of

Brazil as being synonymous with soccer

beaches and of course the Rio Carnival

the exuberant celebration that has

inspired breathless newsreel reports

since the 1930s down in Rio they're

turning night into day it's the final

day of the big carnival and a mere

couple of million karaokes Brazilians -

you are out on a great whoopi yes those

fan seeking Carioca at having themselves

a great whoopie what an excitable group

of people they are what a fun punch now

I will be the first with me it's the

tone of British news newsreels in the

past he's breathtakingly condescending

although before you get too judgmental

you might want to see an American one

from the same era Brazil itself is

larger than the whole of the United

States and it has millions of acres of

land that no white man has ever seen

oh that basic geography lesson just took

a pretty racist turn the point is none

of us have our hands clean anyway the

reason the reason that I want to talk

about Brazil tonight is that they had a

massive election today the first of two

rounds of voting to elect among other

things a new president and what results

are coming in as we speak it is worth

talking about it for a number of reasons

first a Brazilian politics can be a lot

of fun as we've mentioned before

broadcasters have to provide free

airtime to political parties and some

candidates use that airtime to really

around over the years they've been

ads for a guy dressed as a grasshopper a

dancing chicken a small elderly version

of Robin a surprisingly healthy-looking

asama bin Laden

Captain America a husky spider-man and

my favorite Geraldo Wolverine

now I know what you're thinking if

Hillary adjust on that things would have

been a lot different well maybe maybe

maybe but the point we'll never know

will we

we'll never know this election has been

crazy for reasons that go well beyond

novelty Wolverines and if you're

thinking why should I care about it well

first that's a pretty hostile way to put

it but second Brazil is home to 200

million people it's the fifth largest

country on Earth and they could be on

the brink of massive change but his

Brazilians are pissed off right now one

recent survey found that 95% of them say

their countries headed in the wrong

direction as you will see tonight there

is a very real chance that they're about

to elect a dangerous ideologue with

potentially disastrous consequences so

let us look at why that is the case and

the first thing that you really need to

understand is that Brazil is just

emerging from the worst recession in its

history millions are out of work and in

some regions crime is out of control

last year there were more than 63,000

homicides in Brazil that's more than

Europe and the United States combined

and if you live in Rio

you're probably acutely aware of that

fact turreted percent of the citizen

that lives the real was in a middle of a

crossfire once in the last year 30% were

in the middle of crossfire at that point

Rio's Weather Channel should probably

include crossfire in their forecasts

today's looking partly cloudy with a 30

percent charge about hailstorm of

bullets so maybe bring a light flak

jacket with you and the general

dissatisfaction about crime has been

exacerbated by a gigantic corruption

scandal arising from the investigation

known as Operation car wash and I

realize that that doesn't sound like the

name of a major investigation it sounds

like a Netflix original comedy starring

Kevin James that for some reason you'll

be recommended because you watched one

episode of chef's table I don't know I

don't know what your algorithm is

Netflix but I hate it

now now operation carwash and the

scandal uncovered by it is way too

complicated to get into now suffice to

say that it involves this gas station

these two companies inflated contracts

bribes and kickbacks to government

officials and an elderly gentleman who

flew around the world with bricks of

cash shrink-wrapped

and straps beneath thigh-high socks and

a Spanx like vest which really explains

this year's hottest Halloween costume

sexy carwash co-conspirator and look the

sheer scale of this scandal is

absolutely mind-blowing as the elite

prosecutor will tell you how does

carwash compare to Watergate carwash is

much much bigger bigger than Watergate

much bigger we already have charged more

than two hundred people for hundreds of

crimes the amounts of bribes paid go up

to about two billion dollars billion

dollars and bigger than Watergate

Richard Nixon must be spinning in his

grave right now oh wait a second pull

out a bit no he's escaped again he's

done it again god damn it tricky dick

you're so tricky yes so tricky

operated carwash has rocked Brazilians

faith in their government to its very

core and the people there are

understandably disillusioned I think

Brazil is heading towards complete chaos

that is my impression politicians are

not governing it's a complete mess I'm

going to cast a blank ballot because we

don't know who to vote for anymore we

put ourselves in this situation the

country of the future is the country of

misery the country of misery that's just

not a phrase you expect to come out of

Brazil

it's afraid to expect to be the official

tourism slogan of Great Britain come to

read me we promise there will be no

great whoopee so whose job will it be to

try and turn things around in Brazil

well the most popular politician in

Brazil by far is this guy former

President Luiz inácio Lula da Silva he's

beloved for presiding over a period of

prosperity there in which social

programs were expanded and millions were

lifted out of poverty he was actually

running to retake his office and was

projected to win easily there was just

one

issue one of brazil's most influential

political figures is now in police

custody former Brazilian President Luiz

Lula da Silva turned himself in on

Saturday to serve a 12 year sentence for

corruption yep Lula was caught up in

operation car wash - and he claims that

the charges against him were politically

motivated and many supporters believe

him in fact he's still so popular the

polls showed he would have won the

election if he'd been allowed to run

from prison which kind of makes sense

because electing a president who is

already in prison for corruption does

save you this seemingly inevitable

hassle of having to put your president

in prison for corruption it's a time

saver if nothing else

now since Lula is out his party is

running Fernando Haddad in his place

he's the former mayor of Sao Paulo and

he's generally little known him in the

rest of Brazil and instead of trying to

build up a brand of his own daddys

desperately trying to play up his

similarity to Lula in a series of

campaign ads it's subtle but just see if

you can catch it that is just an insult

to people's intelligence you can't just

spin a sign and make people forget which

guy is which I can't make you mix up

Gary Busey and Lucille Ball by spinning

a sign and going goosey loosey goosey

loosey goosey loosey goosey loosey

goosey loosey why because you will still

know which one is America's Sweetheart

and which was married to Desi Arnaz now

the fact is the fact is a dad has his

work cut out for him here because not

only is he not Lula their party the

Workers Party or PT has been heavily

tainted by recent scandals and many

Brazilians are eager for a radical

change and that brings us to the man

currently leading in the polls

Jaya volson ro and the nicest thing that

you can say for him is he has not been

implicated in a corruption investigation

yet unfortunately that's literally the

only nice thing that I can possibly find

to say about him because he is a

terrible human being for a start he's a

big fan of doing finger guns

seriously he does this all the

time there is even video of him teaching

a little girl how to do them for some

reason

and look liking finger guns as far as

I'm concerned is an immediate character

flaw it puts him in the August company

of Michael Scott's children pretending

to be Cowboys and that co-worker who

says things like working hard or hardly

working that everybody hates

unfortunately it only gets worse from

there a member of the Brazilian Congress

since 1991 and known for his sometimes

racist misogynistic homophobic and even

undemocratic views bolson arrow has

passed himself as a political outsider

offensive for most it is his outspoken

nature that has many saying he's

Brazil's version of Donald Trump it's

true he's become known there as the

Brazilian Trump which is both

politically worrisome and also the

grossest style to order and a pubic hair

salon I'll take the up Brazilian Trump

please it's what you rip everything off

the front area but you come some ass

hair around to give the illusion of hair

that's what it is I'm not showing you

that you're imagining it that's in your

head don't be angry with me be angry

with yourself

now unfortunately boss Nara has fired up

many young people in Brazil particularly

from the middle and upper classes there

are some incredible videos online of him

turning up to airports only to be mobbed

by a crowd lifting him onto their

shoulders and chanting for him it is

some intense support and it's worrying

that young people are so excited by him

because he is an extreme hard right

conservative he wants to withdraw Brazil

from the Paris agreement on climate

change and weaken environmental

regulations

he's called refugees arriving in Brazil

the scum of the world and as for crime

he wants to make it easier for

Brazilians to buy guns presumably so

they can fight it themselves but he also

favors some psychotically strong law

enforcement saying a policeman who

doesn't kill isn't a policeman which

incredibly still isn't even in the top

10 most alarming statements that he's

made and some way that he'd actually go

much further

Boston aura has said in the past I am in

favor of a dictatorship which is

particularly worried

as he's a former military captain in a

country that until 1985 was ruled by a

brutal military dictatorship and while

that regime engaged in torture and

extrajudicial killings balsa Morrow has

said that that mistake was that they

simply didn't go far enough I'm in favor

of torture you know that and the people

are too through the vote you won't

change anything in this country nothing

absolutely nothing it's only going to

change unfortunately when we get to a

civil war doing the job that the

military regime didn't do killing 30,000

Wow

he's pretty jarring to hear someone

claim that a military dictatorship

didn't kill enough people he's like

saying Hugh Hefner didn't enough in

the last days of his life really really

because I'm pretty sure the amount he

did it was already a human rights abuse

and regarding Boston arrows famous

homophobia and misogyny it really has to

be seen to be believed

first take a look at how he won't spoke

to a female member of Congress I would

never rape you because you're not worth

it I hope not because I'd slap you in

the face do it I'll slap you back do it

I'll slap you back do it I'll slap you

back what's this are you pushing me do

it I'll slap you back holy he

starts he starts there with I'd never

rape you because you're not worth it and

then somehow manages to top that

terrible statement

that's like saying sorry kids Christmas

is canceled this year why because I've

murdered Santa Claus and both stars

homophobia if any if anything is

actually even worse because in interview

after interview he has said some more

horrifying things he cackles they throw

6 fresco they want to reach our children

in order to turn the children into gay

adults to satisfy their sexuality in the

future if your child starts to become

like that a little gay you take a whip

and you change their behavior people say

it's discrimination but you who's

watching from home would you hire a gay

driver to take your children to school

of course not

that's just appalling and it's frankly

taking all the restraint that I have

right now not to release a charmingly

Illustrated children's book called

Marlon bando punches that guy right

square in the face

which is already very comfortably is

watch what happened when Ellen Page went

to challenge Bolton ro on some of his

views I'm gay so do you think that I

should have been beaten as a child

should not be gay now I'm not going to

look at you and say I think you're gay

that doesn't matter to me you're very

nice if I were a cadet in the Military

Academy and saw you on the street I

would whistle at you all right you're

very pretty

what are you doing he just told her I

wouldn't beat you I would cat call you

and seemed to genuinely think that was a

compliment

and look how confused that made Ellen

Page do you know how hard it is to

confuse Ellen Page she was in Inception

that should be simply as if Polaris Camp

Patton was not already dramatic enough

you may have heard he was actually

stabbed a few weeks ago during a

campaign rally which is absolutely

horrific although although he says that

he's making a full recovery and you can

tell that he is feeling better because

when he was in hospital he pulled out

what else the finger guns

now Bob's our support has actually

increased since that attack even Geraldo

Wolverine endorsed him in this bizarre

video

ah I hate what he's doing I love the way

he's doing it yeah look why is Wolverine

endorsing Boston ro I don't know why

does he seem to be driving a Ford Focus

that quest there's a lot of questions of

that video raises and I just don't have

the answers to any of them well look

there may be some small reason for hope

here a huge movement has emerged in the

last couple of weeks called Ln yow or

not him there have been massive marches

against Boston ro all over Brazil and as

you have seen tonight voting for not him

is a truly excellent idea now today's

election was supposed to just determine

who went into a two-person runoff on

October 28th but if any candidate got

fifty percent or above there would be no

second round they would just be Brazil's

president and as of right now the vote

tally shows Bolton ro and around 48

percent with over three-quarters of the

votes counted so while he will probably

go to a runoff with her dad there is

still a chance that he's going to win

outright tonight and when you think

about it why wouldn't that happen

between taping this show and airtime

boston ro could have won Ruth Bader

Ginsburg could have been eaten by a bear

and every kitten spores could have been

replaced by octopus tentacles

oh that's very possible because it seems

that that's what life is now but

if bolton ro has not won if there is

going to be a runoff in three weeks then

it still it isn't too late that's the

thing and Brazil please look I realize

that you are disgusted with your

politics in the moment and you're not

inspired by any of the alternatives but

anything is better than Boston ro diet

Lula is better

spider-man is better Gary Busey is

better that is Gary Busey I'm pretty

sure that's him the point is Boston ro

does not reflect the best of who you are

Brazil and with any luck you still have

a chance to vote la now and not let this

man finger bang your democracy

you

you

our main story tonight concerns

something Americans simply can't get

enough of prison we we love to be

entertained by it from orange is the new

black

to seemingly MSNBC's entire weekend

programming to the TNT classic Tim

Robbins stand shirtless in the rain the

movie we love prison so much a shocking

number of Americans are currently inside

one as we learned last week during a

House Judiciary Committee hearing our

nation now has the greatest number of

prisoners of any country in the world

nearly one in every 100 adults in

America is in prison or jail that's true

we have over two million people behind

bars right now we have more prisoners at

the moment than China than China we

don't have more of anything than China

other than of course debt to China and

it didn't it didn't always used to be

this way our prison population has

expanded Eightfold since 1970 the only

other thing that's grown at that rate

since the 70s is varieties of Cheerios

cue fruity Cheerios your trumped-up

Froot Loops and you know it and look

look our prison population has exploded

for a number of reasons from the

dismantling of our mental health system

to mandatory minimum sentence laws which

help explain why 97% of people plead

guilty to federal crimes rather than

risk going to trial to of course

drugs because half the people in federal

prison are there on drug charges and it

accounts for a quarter of admissions to

state prisons and of course it's tricky

to know how to feel about all this

because on the one hand the war on drugs

has completely solved our nation's drug

problem so that's good but on the other

hand our drug laws do seem to be a

little draconian and a lot racist

because while white people and African

Americans use drugs about the same

amount a study has found that African

Americans have been sent to prison for

drug offenses at up to 10 times the rate

for some utterly known reason it

to me it reminds me of a joke you know

black people who commit drug offenses

they go to jail like this whereas white

people don't go to jail at all okay so

many people so many people are

incarcerated in America right now it's

become one of the things that Sesame

Street has to explain to children my

dad's my dad's in jail when I was about

your age my dad was incarcerated too

incarcerated is when someone breaks the

law a grown-up rule and then they have

to go to jail or prison

just think about that we now need

adorable singing puppets to explain

prison to children in the same way they

explain the number-7 or what the moon is

and at least Sesame Street is actually

talking about prison the rest of us are

much happier completely ignoring it

perhaps because it's so easy not to care

about prisoners they are by definition

convicted criminals in fact it's so easy

not to care that we are really

comfortable making jokes about one of

the most horrifying things that can

potentially happen to them go directly

to jail do not pass go do not collect

$200 and do not I repeat do not drop the

soap

look doubloons don't drop em you know

what if we were in prison you guys if

you like my bitches we're going to

federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison what

you got any idea what they do to eggs in

San Ricardo prison it ain't over easy oh

do you get it you get it the egg is

gonna get against its will that's why

it's funny

look wake up your children and explain

that joke to them they'll love it go we

are somehow collectively able to laugh

about references to the fact that 4% of

prisoners reported being sexually

victimized in the past year one in 25

now that might not sound like a lot but

think of it like this if every time you

bought two dozen donuts one of them had

been raped

you'd be pretty upset and those are

pastries prisoners are people if you if

you don't know a prisoner or think that

you're ever likely to become one then

their safety and healthy is not going to

be high on your list of priorities you

don't need to know anything about the

conditions that they live in but you

know who should know but maybe the

director of federal prisons and yet

watch him almost comically struggle to

recall a basic detail about one of the

most mentally excruciating things

prisoners can be subjected to solitary

confinement

how big is a cell how big is the average

cell in solitary say that the average

sized cell yeah the size of the cell how

big is it what is I'm trying to get this

is a human thing we're talking about

we've got a lot of statistics how big is

the cell the average size of a cell is I

guess I'm 25 you're looking for the

space of what the yes

the dimensions in feet and inches the

size of the cell that a person is kept

in I want to get some idea of I don't

know

am I asking this wrong no you're not you

are not asking it wrong as far as I can

remember you're just asking what the

style of the cell is but but it

was a long time ago and and to be fair

he did eventually get an answer the

average size should be equivalent to

which six by four what six by four a

couple of things there one that was

clearly a guess and two six by four is

barely an elevator that that is the

length of a six-foot party sub

by the length of the amount of that

party sub that's left over the following

day cuz nobody wants party sucks

look people put their hands all over

them they're disgusted know what that's

not the point that's not the point

but thankfully a few minutes later the

record was corrected for don't you

actual is ten by seven for the cell size

Oh ten by seven step this way your

highness plenty of room for a ping-pong

table and an imaginary opponent as your

mind slowly becomes untethered what is

clear so far is that we are doing a

terrible job of taking care of people

that it is very easy for all of us not

to care about but here's the thing

increasingly we aren't taking care of

them at all private subcontractors have

steadily been taking over certain

services like the aramark

corporation who provide food to prisons

and a promise that with Aramark you can

expect more more savings and hey look

when you're being thrifty with food

costs what's the worst that can happen

record shows 65 instances where aramark

employees failed to provide food or ran

out the private

Aramark changed recipes to include

cheaper sometimes substandard

ingredients Aramark correctional

services made headlines recently after

maggots were found in food served at

prisons here in michigan that is not

good the only time when you are happy to

hear the words maggots were found is

when you are a maggot whose family was

lost at sea we floated three days on a

piece of bread but we never lost hope

and it's not just food being privatized

it's prison healthcare to Arizona tried

that guess how it turned out medical

spending in prisons dropped by thirty

million dollars and staffing levels

plummeted 50 people died an Arizona

Department of Corrections custody in

just the first eight months of this year

compare that to 37 deaths in the

previous two years combined 50 deaths at

this point you could hire the people who

pretend to be doctors on Grey's Anatomy

and you would probably have a lower

mortality rate and a lot more intrigue

cutting costs has led to some incredible

things happening in Arizona one prisoner

had a c-section in jail and this is how

she says they treated her they decided

to use sugar kitchen sugar what do you

mean they use kitchen sugar um the

packets like McDonald's the sugar they

would open it pour it inside and put

gauze over it and tape it up and and had

to do that for like three weeks and they

pour them in your c-section yeah did

they tell you why they were doing that

one of the doctors learned it from I

don't even know I don't know but

basically it's a home remedy sugar was

used to treat wounds before the advent

of antibiotics back in the early

nineteen hundred's yeah but then we all

decided it was no longer an acceptable

medical practice like curing a child's

cough with heroin

well he's not coughing anymore yeah he's

not really doing much of anything

anymore

and I can't find any of the good silver

look

you will never pay a political price for

treating prisoners like this woman badly

you don't even need to pretend to care

here is how one Arizona lawmaker

responded to her story that doesn't

sound like a true allegation that sounds

ridiculous

no prisoners have you know 24/7 to think

up allegations and write letters I'm not

saying that that some of them can't have

a basis in fact but you got to take them

with a grain of salt or in the case of

the hospital maybe a grain of sugar

somewhere in hell Satan just sharpened

his pitchfork and said to his secretary

do me a favor Janis and let me know when

that guy gets here okay I just want to

be ready many states are even

contracting out entire prisons nearly 9%

of prisons are currently run by private

firms like geo group and Corrections

Corporation of America who had combined

revenues of over 3 billion dollars last

year their publicly traded and while

their marketing materials emphasize how

much they do to help their prisoners

rebuild their lives their pitch to

investors has been a little bit

different in a recent investor

presentation CCA pitches its unique

investment opportunity

another reason investing in the jailing

of people makes good financial sense

high recidivism oh but that is a great

way to reassure your investors look look

look we see your concerns you know what

if we fully rehabilitate the prisoners

and they become fully functional members

of society well don't worry that's not

the kind of company we're running here

don't worry once we're done with these

prisoners they're like human boomerangs

they're broken right in the middle and

they keep coming back the key problem

with running prisons as businesses is

that prisons are then run as businesses

pay and staffing ratios are so much

lower than a geo group youth facility in

Mississippi sometimes had just two

officers overseeing as many as 256

prisoners that facility eventually

closed but only after a federal judge

wrote that physical and sexual abuse was

rampant there because its operators had

allowed a cesspool of unconstitutional

and inhuman inhuman

acts and conditions to germinate now I

know that geo will say that presents an

unbalanced picture of their company so

in the interest of balance I will point

out that they've got an award from the

state of Florida citing their bold and

innovative cost-saving business

practices although I think we all know

when the state of Florida gives you an

award that award is basically sarcastic

in fact a quick side note the award was

signed by Florida Governor Rick Scott

who has led the drive for prison

privatization in his state but on one

condition what I've said all along is

that yeah this is not dirty for

detectors this table

I just saved money there's no way we'll

do this we don't say money as you know

Phil says if we don't save at least 7%

we don't do prison privatization hey hey

listen if you think Rick Scott is gonna

look the other way for a company with a

history of the physical abuse of minors

for savings of a mere six percent you

don't know Rick Scott okay Ricky needs

seven Ricky one seven Ricky like seven

okay now if you happen at all to be

interested in asking Rick Scott about

the conduct of the geo group for

goodness sake don't do it tomorrow night

he's busy we actually checked and he's

going to be at a fundraiser at the home

of and this is true the CEO of geo group

I believe the theme of that fundraiser

is a cesspool of unconstitutional and

inhumane acts look

this is this is all so depressing

private prisons are bad yes but the

whole system just seems fundamentally

broken you know what I think if you

don't mind I need a minute I too need

some help understanding this if you

don't mind hey Joe

you seem sad yeah I am sad Timmy it's

just I've been looking at the prison

conditions in America and the whole

system is just so horribly broken yeah I

know what you mean my daddy's in jail

right now for a low-level drug offense

you think that's exactly what I'm

talking about to me that's crazy

well my daddy's in jail because he

killed four people yeah well okay he's

actually a dangerous individual who

needs to be in jail so that's not really

the same thing my dad is in jail and

people pay money to see him yeah that's

actually a zoo that's different

he's in a zoo okay but it looks the same

to him well let's not conflate the two

always gone okay hey hey Dad how barely

broken is the prison system yeah I can't

believe I'm gonna say this but one

prison actually put sugar in a woman's

c-section oh wait a second what's the

c-section oh yeah um oh wait wait what

you mean like the letter C yes yes yes

that's what I'm a he thought that that's

exactly what I mean yeah yeah that's it

make you feel better if we thing about

it

it's that that needs to be spoken

America's prisons are broken it's a hard

truth about incarceration prisons are

needed for a civilization but mandatory

minimums for heroin and crack stack the

system against Hispanics and blacks a

prison population is bigger than

Slovenia cuz we put people in jail

instead of treating gets the funny yeah

I know they put my dad in jail cos they

say is a monster Oh what what what did

he do nothing they just said he looked

like a monster well that's racial

profiling and that's wrong too okay

here's a fact that needs to be spoken

America's prisons are broken prison

conditions are a national disgrace weak

violence Onegin and possibly rain and we

shouldn't lock up reptiles just to look

at their face those are zoos

those are zoos your dad is an alligator

in a zoo I'm a crocodile I'm a crocodile

oh geez you evilest oh we all look alike

right no no that's no website

like no no you can't put that on me that

is clearly not what I was saying

that's so ignorant oh it's a fact that

needs to be spoken America's prisons are

broken is brought to you by decades of

neglect no lack of political Curie a

generous donation by the G oh yes well

as viewers like you

robocalls Tydfil most annoying type of

phone call with every other type of

phone call robo calls are clearly

infuriating every one of us has answered

our phone at some point to hear this hi

this is Josh from the customer service

department can you hear me okay free

medical alert system is a non-bailable

arrest warrant issued under your name

the reason of this call is to inform you

that the IRS is filing lawsuits against

you it was the pause in that last one

that made it a real cliffhanger I mean

you basically knew where it was going

but there was a tantalizing chance that

they were calling people to inform them

that the IRS was filing lawsuit against

Nicolas Cage which you're you assume is

always true but call to confirm every

now and then would be nice the point is

everybody is annoyed by robo calls

hatred of them might be the only thing

that everyone in America agrees on now

and if you've been feeling like you've

been getting more of them recently

you're actually right robo calls

increased by 57% in 2018 to nearly 50

billion calls and it's understandably

pissing people off the plague of robo

calls is getting worse they're the

number one consumer complaint to the

Federal Communications Commission which

receives more than 200,000 protests a

year robo calls make up roughly 60% of

all complaints to the FCC 60% of all

complaints to the FCC are about robo

calls so they are definitely aware of

the problem it's like the actual tea

salon in Vancouver called Netherland but

at this point they definitely know they

have a real issue the only question is

what the are they going to do about

it the nuisance of robo calls has gotten

to the point where even local news

reports about them get interrupted yeah

we can't even get through an interview

without an unwanted phone call I'm

getting a robo call right now as we're

talking as I was preparing this report I

got one it is just not often that a news

report gets interrupted by the subject

of that report is your teenager getting

involved in a strange new sex trend it's

watermelon II and it involves god damn

it can you not do this somewhere else

so tonight tonight let's look at why

robo calls are on the rise and what can

be done about them and let's start with

a basic definition robo calls are any

call where you hear a recording or a

robot voice or when a machine

automatically dialed your number even if

there is a real person on the other end

and while a small percentage of robo

calls may be useful cause about things

like school closings or prescription

reminders the vast majority of them vary

from the irritating to the outright

illegal and you might be surprised to

know how many major companies are

involved in this a list of top Robo

callers includes Capital One Comcast and

Wells Fargo all of whom use robo calls

to chase debts and sometimes they do

that a lot as this woman can testify

librelucha wad never suspected one late

mortgage payment would trigger what she

considers an avalanche of harassment it

came and I just blew me away

lease attorney say they've logged more

than six thousand calls from Wells Fargo

to their client over the last four years

some days such as in January lease says

Wells Fargo rang her more than 20 times

a day that's absolutely ridiculous

because what is the point of calling

someone 20 times a day to collect a debt

oh this is actually great timing because

while I couldn't pay you 45 minutes ago

a small propeller plane full of um

laundered drug money just crashed into

my dam thanks so much for the call you

ravenous ghouls but as you undoubtedly

know it is not just major companies who

do this phone calls are now so cheap and

the technology is so widely available

that just about anyone has the ability

to place a massive number of calls you

created a program here in your life yeah

that's right you're gonna hit a button

and right about now the calls should

start hitting all at once this isn't

saying they're all ringing yeah okay

that's both very impressive and when you

really think about it not actually

that's impressive at all it's basically

the phone electric from the world's

least amusing birthday magician tada

wait nothing well guess what the great

laptop Dini got paid in advance so

all of you

and if you're thinking hold on what

about the Do Not Call list well it still

exists and very occasionally a big

company like Dish Network will get fined

millions for violating it the problem is

though it only applies to one particular

kind of call sales calls and the list

doesn't physically block companies from

calling you it's just something they're

supposed to check before doing so and

scammers generally ignore it first

because they're scammers and second

because it's now easy to conceal their

identity with something called spoofing

and I'll let senator Susan Collins show

you how it works

in the most Awkward possible way my

screen is reading Internal Revenue

Service well let's see

hello this is Susan Collins may I ask

who is calling hello chairman Collins

this is Sam Dewey from your staff are

you calling from the IRS no senator I'm

actually over here

[Applause]

cool you know spoofing is actually the

perfect technology for Susan Collins to

be demonstrating just think about it

it's all about temporarily pretending to

be one thing and then disappointing

everyone when you reveal who you

actually are but but despite sounding

like urban dictionary slang for when

magician's shoot heroin spoofing is

undeniably effective robot callers can

pretend to be calling from your area

increasing the chance that you will pick

up and individual scammers can even

pretend to be someone that you know as

one reporter found out cybersecurity

expert Jim Stickley sets up his phone to

call my mom posing as me hey mom real

quick I need your social security number

I thought some beneficiary forms can you

help me out real quick

I've never there's beneficiary form I

just need to fill it out what's your

cell says kid number real fast great

thanks a lot mom love you

how's it I've got a social security

number holy

literally everything about that was

upsetting from the fact that Jeff Rossen

had someone scam his own mother to the

fact that she fell for it to his amazing

reaction when he realizes that his

mother did something stupid do these

bold choice to broadcast his own mother

stupidity on national television to the

fact that this man just took told

another man's mother that he loves her

too the revelation that he feeds Jeff

Rossen sounds like a middle-aged man

squeezing his own balls

- the fact that Jeff Rossen could really

use a new shirt the point is there's a

lot happening in that clip and none of

it is good also also a quick side note

on that his mother's social security

number wasn't bleeps to protect her

identity

it had to be centered because her social

security number is -

twat - taint juice ship tits it was no

choice it wasn't her choice blame the

Social Security Administration and

thanks to all these new tactics the

onslaught in scam phone calls is huge

and it's only getting worse

next year some estimates predict half of

all mobile calls will be scam calls

Wow and that is a real problem for

consumers because you have to use your

phone

we can't go back to the days where

everyone would just shout their message

into a jar and then mail that jar across

the country that was a terrible system

and it was only marginally more accurate

than having AT&T now oh you like that

business daddy

Johnny's acting up again Chinese acting

up oh I've been I'm gonna get some spicy

jars in the mail about that so the point

is what can we do about this well on a

personal level you can tell individual

companies you do business with not to

call you by law they're actually not

allowed to robocall your cell without

consent but that is where this gets

tricky because those user agreements

that you agreed to you know the ones

that no one has ever read they often

give companies consent to robocall you

and can make revoking it incredibly

difficult for instance if you're a

customer of credit one bank and you want

them to stop robocalling yourself

just take out your User Agreement and

turn to page four section 19 see where

you'll find that you have to physically

mail them written notice featuring your

name mailing address and the last four

digits of your account number two this P

o box in Nevada and it makes total sense

what you had opted not to do that I

would rather receive a thousand phone

calls a day every day for the rest of my

life then go out and buy a stamp I mean

would I even do that do I have to

go to a post office or gonna just go to

a Walgreens and if I can go to Walgreens

is it all the Walgreens is or just some

and if it's just some how do I find out

which ones call literally call a place

of business with my telephone and ask

them if they could sell me a stamp okay

then what I have to physically walk to

the Walgreens literally physically walk

like with my legs and wait in line and

buy the stamp wat now put it in a

mailbox what the am I gonna find

that mailbox

the only mailboxes I ever see are those

we had boarded up green ones what's the

are those things by the way they're

spooky that's what they are it looks

like a memorial of a pass mailbox that

died in a war

now I have to find the one mailbox in

New York City that hasn't sacrificed its

life in this country pry open its big

hungry male mouth and shove a stamped

envelope down its dusty throat none of

that's gonna happen I'd rather die than

engage in that nonsense and deep down I

think you know that

so so it is no wonder that some people

choose to simply mess with robocallers

as one journalist did when he noticed

the person on the other end sounded a

bit suspicious well I'm calling about an

online request you once made about

health insurance coverage okay with all

major companies incomparable hey are you

a robot what will you tell me you're not

a robot just say I'm not a robot please

I am a real person I mean I believe you

but will you just say I'm not a robot

it'll make me feel better to hear you

say if you could say the words I'm not a

robot it would really mean a lot to me I

am a real person can you hear me okay

right but will you say I'm not a robot

[Laughter]

[Applause]

that man is dead now she killed him she

stole his skin she walks among us and

she'll kill again well as far as that is

experts advise you not to engage with

robocalls at all don't pick up and don't

talk if you do answer because that lets

them know that yours is a live number

and you'll just get robo calls more but

the much bigger point here is it should

not entirely be up to us to deal with

this the FCC has the authority

to police robo calls and a few years

back they actually put some guardrails

in place with a set of rules designed to

limit them as the FCC's former chair

explained at the time they they

basically followed a simple principle

the consumer needs to be the one who's

in charge the consumer needs to give

consent that they want to be called or

if they are called and haven't given

consent to remove that consent by saying

don't call me anymore or by calling

their phone company and saying I don't

want to get these calls and that sounds

completely reasonable but unfortunately

those rules were then struck down after

a trade group sued at which point robo

calls increased significantly so we made

real progress toward addressing a

problem but then we blew it we basically

got our one year sobriety chip then

celebrated by drinking a gallon of

Captain Morgan which is not to say that

there aren't things that the FCC could

do unfortunately their current chair is

this guy at G PI you've probably seen

him on this show before alongside his

stupid mark and by the way Cheers cheers

for you pi says a lot of the right

things about this he said that robo

calls are the scourge of civilization

and he's had a little too much fun

showing how dedicated he is to tackling

this issue to borrow from former

President Kennedy let every robot caller

know whether it wishes us well or ill

and we shall pay any price bear any

burden meet any hardship support any

solution and oppose any but to assure

the survival and the peace of American

consumers it sounds like I may have just

won a cruise if you'll excuse me I have

to take the skull but thank you very

much mr. chairman

ladies and gentlemen that man is a

goober and as you probably have

aspirations for a high political office

but I would argue that that's not gonna

work out for him because Americans can

have and will elect bastards morons

blowhards crooks perverts dipshits con

men scumbags and shitweasels but they

will never ever elect a goober but while

he talks a good game pie actually

opposed those rules that we mentioned

earlier and was extremely happy when

they were overturned and since becoming

FCC chair he has seemed too reluctant to

force telecoms to act for instance he

could require them to offer free call

blocking services or implement something

called call authentication which could

significantly curtail spoofing but he

hasn't done that instead what he's done

is urge them to do it and while some say

that they are working on it the fact is

if he had required them to do it from

the get-go we might actually have those

fixes by now because telecom companies

aren't really gonna listen to you unless

you force them to and AT&T isn't going

to listen to you at all unless you call

them on t-mobile how will they hear

otherwise their call would drop out

that's right business tapping oh that's

right you've inherited a problem child

let's ask let's dance you and I but the

thing experts are really worried that PI

might do is bow to pressure from groups

like telemarketers and banks and draft a

new narrower definition of what

constitutes autodialing it's technical

but that would basically limit what

would count as a robo call and if he

does that it could have huge

consequences so for instance if Wells

Fargo called your cellphone 6,000 times

you might no longer be able to sue them

under anti Robo call laws and it is safe

to assume that at that point robo calls

are going to increase even more so if

only there was a way to get the FCC's

attention on this issue of course I mean

what one way to do that would be if

someone had I don't know say the office

numbers of all five FCC commissioners

because then you could hypothetically

set up a program to robocall those

numbers every 90 minutes with a message

say I don't know like this high FCC this

is John from customer service

congratulations you've just won a chance

to lower robo calls in America today

sorry but I am a live person robo calls

are incredibly annoying and the person

who can stop them is you talk to you

again in 90 minutes is a bagpipe music

that would be really annoying right to

get that every 90 minutes it would

really drive the point home and nope I

guess at this point it's probably

obvious what is about to happen here yes

FCC we meet again old friends except

this time unlike our past encounters I

don't actually need to ask hoards of

real people to bombard you with messages

because with the miracle of Robo calling

I can now do it all by myself you see it

turns out Robo calling is so easy it

only took our tech guy literally 15

minutes to work out how to do it so when

I press this button will it trigger our

robo calls to the FCC no no that that

would be too simple instead behold what

instead when my finger presses this

button it will trigger this much larger

finger that will press a much larger

button which will trigger our calls to

the FCC so FCC you know what you need to

do and by the way if you wanted to if

you want to tell us that you don't

consent to be Robo called that's

absolutely no problem just write a

certified letter to the address that

we've buried somewhere within the first

chapter of Moby Dick

that's currently scrolling up the screen

you've got that right you got it find

the address write us a letter and we'll

stop the calls immediately and if you're

thinking that there should be a simpler

way to opt out well no okay there's

simply no point delaying this any longer

here goes unleash hell

it's raining

for you that's our show

Oh

[Applause]

the police they protect us they serve us

and they provide us with an endless

source of TV show one-liners rock paper

scissors gun well I know Serena Williams

but I know one thing it's all in the

wrist who'd want to cut your penis off

take a number

okay now you laugh but admit it you want

to watch the rest of that episode right

now hello

public trust in the police is one of the

most vital elements in a civilized

society but for many Americans that

trust has been undermined by a procedure

called civil forfeiture now I know it

sounds like a Gwyneth Paltrow euphemism

for divorce but but incredibly it's

actually even worse than that civil

asset forfeiture is really a mechanism

by which the state and federal

government can seize people's property

without having to convict them of a

crime most people can't afford to hire a

lawyer to challenge it it's really

legalized robbery by law enforcement I

think about it that is a tough crime to

report to the police give me a

description of what the guy looked like

well to be honest he looked a lot like

the guy currently asking me what the guy

looked like and if you think this sounds

bad just wait till you see how it looks

because the Washington Post recently

published a major investigation

featuring stories like that of this man

who was driving from Michigan to San

Francisco with $2,400 in cash that his

dad had lent him to start a new job when

he was pulled over in Nevada I gave him

my life since and registration and then

as he was looking at that information he

asked me how much money I was traveling

with Lee told about that money his dad

gave him which he kept in the trunk he

told me to turn on my air vents on high

and roll up my windows and get out of

the car because he was gonna run a

canine around it

dov didn't find drugs but he did find

the $2,400

he said no I'm gonna keep the money

because I've concluded through my

investigation here that you are

traveling from Michigan to California to

purchase drugs Wow there is so much

wrong there including the fact that any

policeman who genuinely believes you

need to travel from Michigan

to California to purchase drugs needs to

be introduced to the concept of the

University of wisconsin-madison okay

it's right there and the problem is

stories like that are surprisingly

common in fact since 9/11 under just one

program please have taken two and a half

billion dollars in the course of over

61,000 seizures of cash alone from

people who and this is the mind-blowing

part were not charged with a crime that

is the sort of police behavior that we

laugh at other countries for along with

their accents and silly hats the way

civil forfeiture generally works is that

if the police believe they have a

preponderance of the evidence that

suggests your property was or could be

used in a crime they may confiscate it

and it gets even weirder many folks are

unfamiliar with the idea of civil

forfeiture which is actually a case

brought against directly against a piece

of property where you don't need to be

proven guilty of a crime for your goods

to be taken away exactly you don't need

to be charged with a crime because it's

not you that's on trial it's your stuff

that's what these cases have

historically had I caching names such as

and all of these are real United States

versus 8850 dollars in US currency

United States versus an article

consisting of 50,000 cardboard boxes

more or less each containing one pair of

cracker bones and United States versus

approximately 64,000 695 pounds of shark

fins which must have been an amazing

court case and do you see those shark

fins in the room right now let the

record show the witness is pointed at

roughly 65,000 pounds of shark fins

guilty guilty and it's also worth noting

that your possessions generally have

fewer protections under the law than you

do under civil forfeiture laws your

property is guilty until you prove it

innocent

how can that be possible at this point

I'm surprised objects don't have their

own civil rights leader like Martin

scooter King or Harvey carton of milk

now now to be fair civil forfeiture laws

have had some positive consequences

they've crippled powerful drug

trafficking organizations forted

criminals and returned billions of

dollars to victims the problem is that

many police departments are allowed to

keep most or all of the money they

seized and knowing that starts to make

you wonder about the motivations of

these kinds of questions is there any

large amounts of cash in the vehicle ID

any large sums of money over $5,000 in

cash to these guys

any large Matthew a think you know I'll

take whatever cash you got in there and

is that a Slurpee in the cup holder what

flavor great never mind

do you know what I will take it I'll

take it the question do you have cash in

the vehicle is surprisingly common in

traffic stops and the police are

prepared to overcome any language

barrier to ask it tiene mucho mucho

dinero ensued rocky trailer let's let's

be clear he just said ten e mucho mucho

dinero in suit rocky trailer which which

sounds like an alien's first attempt to

communicate with humans after crash

landing in a Taco Bell in fact in fact

let's all just pause for a moment to

enjoy that sentence because every single

word of it is funny first 10 e

pronounced incorrectly mucho one of the

few words he knows in Spanish mucho

repeated words de niro a famed actor

in a rapid shift to English sooo rapid

shift back to Spanish trucky trailer

trucky trailer it's magnificent that is

magnificent it's a work of art now now

this happened in Tennessee a state where

local law enforcement authorities are

allowed to keep as much as 100 percent

of the proceeds from civil forfeitures a

local news investigation found multiple

troubling cases of people having money

seized such as George rebe who had

$20,000 seized after he was stopped for

speeding the police officer argued it

was drug money despite the fact that

Reba had a pretty good explanation I

told him I had active bids on eBay that

I was trying to buy a vehicle and they

they just didn't want to hear it

inspector Reba had proof on his computer

but the muttering officer drew up a

damning affidavit citing his own

training that common people do not carry

this much you whisk currency and did he

tell you that he was trying to buy a car

he did but you did not include that in

your report

if it's not in their attempt a little so

why would you leave that out

what do you mean you don't know

I expect a better answer from a police

officer than a four-year-old who just

spilled grape juice on the couch what

happened to your drink I don't know I

don't know if it's not in my glass it's

not in my glass I don't know I don't

know and look it's not always just a

roadside stop in 2008 police raided the

Contemporary Art Institute of Detroit

during its funk night because it didn't

have a liquor license

seizing 44 cars under the argument that

simply driving vehicles to the location

of an unlawful sale of alcohol were

sufficient to seize a car which means

you may as well seize any car driven by

any teenager on prom night because they

are all going to Chad's place Chad's got

the hook-up what we actually managed to

get the security video of that Detroit

raid and you can see the police burst in

and arrest people with the disco lights

still swirling in the single funkiest

shakedown in human history they each had

to pay $900 to get their cars out of the

impound with the exception of the one

person whose car was actually stolen

from the Lots to which it had been told

which seems what the sort of thing the

police should be investigating if they

weren't too busy raiding art gallery

funk nights and at this point you may be

thinking well sure the police

departments are getting a lot of money

from seizing stuff but I'm sure there

are limitations on how they can spend it

well allow me to take you to a 2012

Columbia Missouri Citizen Police Review

Board hearing how do you decide

forfeiture funds you know it's usually

based on the need well I take that back

fashion though I'd imagine you you sign

off on yeah it's there are some

limitations on it you know it's actually

there's not really on the forfeiture

staff actually there's basically no

limitations at all come to think of it

there's essentially gods with gods

we're like the anti Spider Man great

power no responsibilities I can't

believe this

to come up before and look his honesty

was not over it we just usually base it

on something that would be nice to have

that we can't get in the budget for it

for instance though you know we try not

to use it for things that we need to

depend on you know because we need to go

ahead and have those purchased but it's

kind of like pennies from heaven you

know it gets you a toy or something that

you need this is the way we typically

look at it that's right

that's right they buy toys with pennies

from heaven well they should know those

pennies may not be falling from heaven

so much of from the pockets of the

people they're holding upside down and

shaking and in terms of what kind of

toys police departments buy that really

depends for instance in Massachusetts

one DA's office used forfeiture money to

buy their own Zamboni

even though auditors noted we could not

determine where this machine was located

or the law enforcement purpose it serves

although that last one is obvious just

think about it because if you are

robbing a bank and the police pull up in

a Zamboni you're going to give yourself

up just out of sheer curiosity and in

Texas in Texas one DA's office had an

even more imaginative idea and I'll let

a concerned citizen of a public hearing

tell you all about it with or without a

law degree everyone here knows that

purchases of kegs of beer margarita

machines and bottles of Crown Royal for

office parties as was done in Montgomery

County don't qualify as expenses for

official purposes that's true in Texas

they bought a margarita machine they

were literally using this money as their

own personal slush fund

they will litter it's perfect the

analogy is perfect and look look if the

police need money for equipment we

should clearly be giving it to them and

if they need money for margarita

machines they should be paid for

that themselves but these civil

forfeiture laws have warped law

enforcement priorities and perception

and nowhere is that more clear than

Philadelphia Philadelphia officials over

a 10-year period have seized more than

1,000 houses about 3,300 vehicles and 44

million dollars in cash and civil

forfeitures holy

usually when someone describes something

taking 3,000 vehicles and a thousand

houses they're talking about a

hurricane now one of those houses

belongs to the sorav Ellis family and

the reason for that seizure seems a

little harsh from the outside police

arrested their 22 year old son Yanni on

drug charges $40 worth of heroin and

claimed he was selling drugs out of the

home police and prosecutors came armed

with a lawsuit against the house itself

exactly because remember the parents

aren't on trial the house is which is

clearly ridiculous the only drug

containing house that needs a lawsuit

against it is this one you're on the

edge you're on the edge house you're

this close you're this close to losing

your job you're good damn it you're good

house you're close house you're close

but you're good but you're so close but

you're so good house and once their

house was seized

the Soraa valises got to experience the

final problem with civil forfeiture

recourse can be incredibly difficult

here in dole Delphia if you have your

property taken you can come here to City

Hall and go to courtroom 478 and try to

get it back problem is the people that

are taking the belongings are also the

ones calling the shots inside the

courtroom the sort of Ellis's showed up

to courtroom four seven eight ready to

plead their case to a judge instead they

say they faced a prosecutor from the

DA's office

that's right their first step in

challenging the police season

I was in a courtroom without a judge

hearing their case how can you even

still call that a courtroom if you take

all the doctors out of a hospital and

replace them with otters that's no

longer a hospital it's better it's much

better but it's not a hospital I don't

know what I love it but it's not a

hospital in fact recourse is so

difficult that most people who've lost

after civil forfeiture just choose to

walk away rather than fight so this

point it should seem obvious that the

bads may be starting to outweigh the

good with civil forfeiture laws so we've

really got two choices we can we can

take a hard look at reforming them or at

the very least we need to reform our

network cop dramas to make them a lot

more representative of what is actually

happening coming soon

law in order civil asset forfeiture unit

get ready to go inside the thrilling

world of civil forfeiture knock knock

freeze police hands on the ground get

off the sofa keep them where we can see

him you're under arrest

what for you guys got nothing on me not

you sofa

coming this fall a procedural about law

enforcement shadiest procedure rough

night huh uh well it's about to get a

lot rougher that's 2500 in cash doing

and hanging out in somebody's glove box

huh answer me these cops are determined

and they won't stop until they get

everything every last thing you're dirty

right drug deal guns what is it I can't

help you don't talk to me I'm gonna beat

the out of you

detective Parvati civil forfeiture unit

brace yourself for heart pounding

takedowns is this big arrest send it

back up send in backup

the defendants are in animates but the

drama is anything but fresco

there's a pile of silver dollars next

door that says you do it you will lose

and I will win

stay on the streets too long the city

leaves a bad taste in your mouth hey I

know what I'll get it out

an order civil asset forfeiture unit

under crumple you up to look like a

cat's asshole

we begin tonight obviously with the

major news of the week the dramatic

release of one man's painstaking work

and the impact it may have on history

[Music]

it's Queen Elizabeth 93rd birthday today

and that guy just nailed it but

but obviously there was one other major

story this week concerning the latest

installment in the ongoing stalker that

we've been calling stupid Watergate

basically water gauge but if Nixon had

been kicked in the head by a bunny ghost

and also if that billy goats have been

the White House chief of staff and the

reason we're talking about this is that

on Thursday the Muller report was

finally released it was over 400 pages

long and many in the media chose to make

a feature of processing it in plain

sight at miss NBC had Ari Melba reading

it in the corner of the studio as if

relegated to the kids table while New

York won at 30 uninterrupted seconds of

their printer getting ready to print the

report out but what's the molar report

had actually been read it became clear

that there was a lot in it Muller

confirmed that Russia interfered in our

election made repeated contacts with

Trump associates but did not conclude

that the Trump team engaged in a

criminal conspiracy with Russia but the

report said several actions by the

president were investigated as

potentially amounting to obstruction of

justice

Muller's team says if we had confidence

that the president clearly did not

commit obstruction of justice we would

so state and that last one is a pretty

conspicuous non exoneration if you were

interviewing the job applicant and they

told you just so you know I wasn't found

guilty of my neighbor's

mailboxes but I also specifically wasn't

found to innocence necessarily rule them

out but you definitely think twice about

hiring them and some of the details in

this report were incredible when Trump

learned that Special Counsel Robert

Muller was appointed he slumped back at

his chair and said oh my god this is

terrible

this is the end of my presidency I'm

effed

he said I'm and while we

obviously don't know whether Trump will

face any repercussions from this report

I'd like to just live for a little

longer in the moment of him saying this

is the end of my presidency I'm

in fact I'd like to take some artistic

license to fully paint that scene for

you Trump upon learning Robert Muller

was appointed slumping back in his chair

meanwhile Ivanka is playing fetch with

John Jr

its tongue is stuck to a somehow frozen

flagpole Reince Priebus is walking

around with his head inside a honeypot

jared is standing motionless directly in

front of a blank wall steve Bannon is

stress eating a bowl of used syringes

and Steven Miller is gleefully pulling

the legs off a spider while Trump says

those beautiful words as tears roll down

his cheeks this is the end of my

presidency

I'm and right at that very moment

a pigeon flies into the room and shits

in his mouth that's what happened I'm

just saying we don't definitively know

that it didn't and look look we clearly

can't cover everything in the report

tonight so instead I'd like to

concentrate on two key factors that may

have saved the president here

incompetence when it comes to conspiracy

with Russia and disobedience when it

comes to obstruction of justice so let's

start with incompetence meaning let's

start with Michael Cohen because the

report spells out that Cohen was in

contact with Russians through much of

the campaign

mostly concerning Trump's efforts to

build a tower in Moscow which in and of

itself is already wildly inappropriate

it is clearly compromising for a

presidential candidate to be asking for

business papers from a hostile foreign

government but from the very beginning

Cohen was laughably inept at one point

he reached out to Putin's press

spokesman Dmitry Peskov but couldn't get

through it turns out that's because he

meant to email PR Pescara at PR press

gov but actually emailed dot gough

instead and dot gough of course sends

you right to the server for the new HBO

series Game of Thrones err where

powerful flounder families fight for

control of the seven sandbars it starts

in June this network is another

even more ridiculous case of Cohen

bungling contact with Russians involved

dmitry klokov

a former press secretary to russia's

energy energy minister cloak offs

ex-wife had contacted Ivanka offering

his assistance to the Trump campaign so

that is someone with ties to the Russian

government offering help to elect Trump

Ivanka forwarded that email to Cohen who

googled dmitry klokov and concluded that

the person they must be talking about

was a

former Olympic weightlifter by that name

a man who has videos online like this

[Applause]

Koen apparently saw that and thought

well I definitely got the right to Mitri

klokov apparently Russia's energy

ministers press secretary is completely

jacked and good for you bruh hustle for

that muscle sorted a strong tomorrow I'm

alright get swole feed the soul from one

beef towel to another respect and from

all appearances the real cloak off kept

trying to set up a meeting between Trump

and Vladimir Putin but Cohen basically

blew that proposal off which may not be

surprising given that even during his

interviews with Muller Cohen still

appeared to believe that the cloak off

he spoke with was the Olympic

weightlifter and of course he was

confused

he was probably still trying to figure

out why deceased German ice hockey

goalie robert muller wanted to speak

with him in the first place

and it wasn't just Cohen the report

found multiple instances where people

tied to the Russian government offered

Trump's campaign assistance and in some

instances the campaign was receptive but

the thing that seemed to stop closer

coordination from happening was often

cartoonish levels of disorganization and

incompetence on top of which there were

times when the Trump's team's ignorant

ignorant of basic legal concepts seems

to have actively helped shield them from

criminal liability most notably when it

came to the infamous Trump Tower meeting

featuring Don jr. Jerrod Paul Manafort

and a Russian offering more dirt

Muller's team concluded it would

unlikely be able to prove beyond a

reasonable doubt that the meeting

participants had general knowledge that

their conduct was unlawful yeah that

kind of makes sense doesn't it it is

gonna be hard to prove that this guy had

general knowledge that his conduct could

be breaking the law or that he had

general knowledge of anything at all

other than what it feels like to watch

Flags get more hugs from your dad than

you get if you live to be a thousand

so so when it comes to conspiracy trunk

saving grades may have been that despite

Russians wanting to help everyone around

him was too inept to work with them so

as for the other major question in

mullahs report obstruction of justice

Trump's saving graves there may have

been that despite ample evidence that he

tried to do it everyone around him was

too disobedient to listen the report

paints a remarkable portrait of the

President as a man obsessed with the

Russia investigation trying to seize

control of the inquiry through his White

House aides it highlights at least 10

current and former administration

officials or associates who did not

carry out his orders Wow

the news that the President ordered

subordinates to do things that might

constitute obstruction and then they

just ignored him is both reassuring and

also terrified

that's not hearing your spouse say you

don't have to worry about the snake

because the baby killed it well hold on

I'm glad the snake is dead but that

means that was a snake in there

and it also means our baby has snake

killing strength I'm sorry there's a lot

to process here I'm happy I'm relieved

but I'm also angry and confused you're

throwing a lot of at me

and there are multiple instances of

people ignoring the president's

instructions like when Trump asked Cory

Lewandowski to send his Attorney General

a message the president gave him orders

to tell the Attorney General then Jeff

Sessions to curtail the scope of the

Russia investigation now Lewandowski

according to the report never followed

through on it attempting to pass it off

to another aide who did also not follow

through on what the president instructed

so that's a chain of two people failing

to follow through on a demand from the

president and he didn't stop there

because that age then passed Trump's

order off to an assistant who opened the

window and shouted it to a groundskeeper

who wrote it down and taped it to a

Roomba that was passing by which drove

itself straight into the river because

this isn't why it got into government

although the most shocking example of

the president being ignored involved

former White House Counsel Don Magan

Trump apparently called and directed him

to have mullah removed as special

counsel Magan refused but Trump kept

pushing until finally this happened

instead of carrying out Trump's request

Magan decided he would quit instead

called he called his lawyer drove to the

White House packed up his office

prepared to submit a resignation letter

with his chief of staff told Reince

Priebus that the president has asked him

to do crazy blank and inform Priebus and

Bannon that he was leaving holy

blank preparing to quit because you're

being asked to do crazy isn't what

you expect from the White House Council

it's what you expect from Nicolas Cage's

personal assistants no ridiculous

I'm not constructing a 10-foot voodoo

doll of you out of red gemstones and

dead croaks I have a master's degree

this is crazy Nicholas it's crazy

you might take some reassurance

from the fact that so many of the people

in Trump's orbit did not do as he asked

but the worrying thing is lots of those

people are gone now and the newer

figures seem very much on the same page

as the president just look at how the

report was released

not only did Trump's Attorney General

William Bar vastly downplay its contents

in his letter summarizing it to Congress

but he also gave a preemptive press

conference to spin the reports contents

repeating Trump's favorite phrase no

collusion and making excuses for the

president like this as the special

counsels report acknowledges there is

substantial evidence to show that the

president was frustrated and angered by

his sincere belief that the

investigation was undermining his

presidency propelled by his political

opponents and fueled by illegal leaks

okay so first of all Donald Trump has

never once in his life being motivated

by a sincere belief he's motivated by

two things only one the icy howling wind

swirling in the yawning chasm of pitch

blackness where his soul should be and

to the hopeless pursuit of the only

woman he truly loves

when you look at his presidency this way

it's actually quite romantic and also if

I may quote the advice that Alec

Baldwin's attorney gives his client

being angry is not the same thing as

being innocent and that wasn't the only

thing that vas said that in the wake of

actually reading the report seems

laughably and willfully misleading the

White House fully cooperated with the

special counsels investigation the

president took no act that in fact

deprived the special counsel of the

documents and witnesses necessary to

complete his investigation but that is

at best a gross mischaracterization of

what the report actually said because

full cooperation would have involved

sitting down for an interview which

Trump did not do and mullick not only

found Trump's written answers inadequate

he also wrote that he engaged in efforts

to curtail the special counsels

investigation and prevent the disclosure

of evidence to it including through

public and private contacts with

potential witnesses which is pretty much

the exact opposite of what Bar set

it's like boss summarized the Twilight

novels as a girl in Florida goes to

third base with a Wookiee no I'm not

even sure we're reading the same

underlying material I've read the real

book where a dog man falls in love with

a baby respect the text or not the

written words look look all of this is

clearly very depressing and there's

still so much that we don't know there

are significant reductions within the

report as well as references to 14

investigations that Muller handed off to

other prosecutors 12 of which remained

secret and that can make this feel a

little anticlimactic

especially because ever since bar

summary came out the Trump

administration has been taking an

unearned victory lap the idea that any

of us and me as the campaign manager

would cheat steal lie cut corners talk

to Russians was an insult from the

beginning but was it though

was it an insult would be to say that

Kelly and Conway died many years ago and

is now a skin suit occupied and operated

by three hundred rats who've evolved the

ability to live that's an insult that's

what is insulting however is that the

mall report explicitly shows Trump and

his associates doing many of the things

that she just listed because here's the

important thing to remember the report

only vindicates the administration on

their own false premises a year ago we

pointed out the Trump and his team we're

trying to Center the narrative on

collusion despite the fact that that

term has no specific legal meaning in

criminal law but by reframing the

investigation that way Trump ensured

that anything short of Mullah publishing

400 pages of text messages between him

and Putin gaming out election fraud

meant the whole thing was a complete

waste of time

so mullahs report did not find collusion

and wasn't trying to because that word

doesn't even apply here and it didn't

establish that Trump's team was part of

a criminal conspiracy to interfere with

the election but it found a lot of other

stuff because just consider what we

learned or had confirmed this week

Russia interfered in our election and

made efforts to help Trump win whilebut

and while his campaign did not provably

cooperate with Russia they seemed eager

to accept their help in a way that no

one should be comfortable with also

Trump may have obstructed justice and if

he didn't it might only be because

people who work for him ignored his

orders and on top of all of this the

Attorney General the nation's top law

enforcement official has proven himself

to be a dishonest hack and I'm not

saying that any of that is good news but

it is definitely good that we know about

it the point is having the knowledge

that the Muller report provides is

infinitely better than the alternative

because that knowledge can inform

Congress going forward and crucially

voters a year and a half from now and

the alternative is for America to end up

like Michael Cohen perpetually confused

easily manipulated and never fully

understanding how a guy with a full-time

job as a press secretary can also be

such a max jacked certifiable meat

okay

[Applause]

you

mobile homes perfected by humans but

invented by snails there are many

misconceptions about mobile or

manufactured homes for instance right

now you may be picturing something that

looks like this but for decades the

industry has been trying to change that

image running ads like this one you

bought a mobile home

today's manufactured home factory build

quality at a price that makes sense we

have three big bedrooms

[Music]

today's manufactured home you bottomed

out okay

I think I'll get it but for the record

that sexy saxophone riff would make a

reveal of anything seem good here I'll

show you

you bought a taxidermy fox

[Music]

[Applause]

box but but it is it is true in history

it can be genuinely hard to tell the

difference between manufactured homes

and conventional homes just like it's

hard to tell the difference between

Jessica Chastain and Bryce Dallas Howard

the difference is like a mobile home

Bryce Dallas Howard is assembled

off-site than placed on wheels and moved

to her permanent location around 20

million people live in mobile homes

that's roughly one in eighteen Americans

and they're one of America's last

affordable housing options costing up to

50% less per square foot than a

conventional house which is great but in

recent years some of the biggest

investors in America have moved into

this industry according to one new

report over a hundred thousand home

sites traditionally run by mom-and-pop

businesses are now owned or partly owned

by private equity firms like these so

the homes of some of the poorest people

in America are getting snapped up by

some of the richest people in America

and luckily there'll be no problems

whatsoever except I'm obviously kidding

it's going terribly if you do want to

hear me lie about stories to make you

feel better you might enjoy our spin-off

show everything's fine with John Oliver

did you know Isis is just hamsters this

little terrorist name is dumpling and he

doesn't even know how to use his gun

sadly back in the real world the truth

is the rise of big-money investors in

mobile homes has led to a corresponding

spike in rents fees and local news

stories like these people living at a

local mobile home park outraged over the

sharp increase in lot rent rents were

raised by as much as 36% rents were

raised by nearly 60% Ella Carter lives

on a fixed income her lot rents just

gone up and it all adds up to a bill she

can't afford now it's a matter of okay

now which medication am I going to take

and half so that I can make a stretch

out a little bit longer that's clearly

horrible because nobody should be made

to stretch out medicine it's sad enough

when you stretch out your almost empty

bottle of shampoo by adding a bunch of

water and if you didn't relate to that

joke you haven't suffered a single day

in your life

so tonight tonight let's take a look at

the mobile home industry let's start

with the company that sells more mobile

homes than any other Clayton Homes

controlled by one of the richest men in

America Warren Buffett's although the

company's ads choose to feature a more

down-home spokesman what do I know about

Clayton Homes I know they're built right

here in America and they know the

difference between a house and a home

hey miss Kay a home is where you get

your famous sweet potato powder honey

and y'all know how we all try to make

miss Kay happy happy happy

clean homes good call judging by that

creepy delivery there's just no way that

getting her famous sweet potato pie is

not also code for some kind of

disgusting sex act it probably means

miss case smearing pie filling on his

ball sack while a live duck scraped it

off with his bill and if it does good

call but but the key difference between

a mobile and a conventional home has

nothing to do with pie it has to do with

how it retains its value just listen to

finance guru Dave Ramsey give his

no-nonsense take on whether or not you

should buy one mobile homes go down in

value it's the only thing you own that

you live in that goes down in value even

if you buy dirt under it that goes up

and value more than it goes down in

value so it appears you didn't lose

money you lost money you buy a $50,000

mobile home in a few years it's a

$10,000 mobile home I mean cars go down

and buy you mobile homes go down in

value it's a car you sleep in I'm gonna

say I find the negativity of his tongue

genuinely refreshing there that guy

should replace Jim Cramer on his show

no more running around excitedly

pressing buttons like a little boy at an

arcade just an angry old grump hunched

over a desk telling you you're going to

lose money so so mobile homes may be a

terrible investment for people buying

them but they've been an incredible

investment for Warren Buffett's Clayton

Homes generated pre-tax earnings of nine

hundred and eleven million dollars last

year and they've done that not just by

selling homes but by financing them as

well because instead of being financed

with mortgages mobile homes tend to be

bought with high interest short

chattel loans the kanji used to buy a

car or a TV and an investigation a few

years back found Clayton relies on

predatory sales practices exorbitant

fees and interest rates that can exceed

15% trapping many buyers in loans they

can't afford now Clayton strenuously

denies all of that saying the report was

based on isolated incidents and that its

customers reports high levels of

satisfaction although I will point out

that one of those isolated incidents was

this call a Clayton customer got when

she fell behind on payments

what do you suggest except for the

things that you already suggest which

doesn't work holy-shit

go donate blood I guess one way to get

your customers to report high levels of

satisfaction is to make sure they're all

feeling lightheaded after you literally

bleed them dry but but one of

the biggest problems here isn't even to

do with how you pay for a mobile home or

how quickly it loses its value it's

where you put it because around a third

of mobile home dwellers owned their

homes but don't own the land underneath

it that's because they live in mobile

home parks and pay rent on that land to

the park owner but in recent years large

investors have been snatching those

parks up and either tearing them down or

ratcheting up rent and fees as these

women experienced firsthand the end-all

family decided to sell the park and they

sold it to the Carlyle Group

first of all Carlyle started off with an

immediate 8% increase space rent so that

was a threat to most of us who are

living on fixed income I don't know

what's gonna happen I may be forced to

leave everything like doctors my friends

the life I've known here even though I

own my own it's true that woman may lose

her home so the Carlyle Group an

investment firm with 216 billion dollars

in assets can make more money for their

shareholders if the concept of income

in equality came to life that is the

sentence it would scream when it orgasms

now Carlisle Carlisle insists that the

price heights were to pay for park

improvements which makes complete sense

if you ask these why they got

into private equity I'm sure they say to

you Oh

to break-even on investments in the

beautification of affordable housing why

else would we do this

I also apparently have to tell you that

Carlisle has a safety net program for

low-income residents although you should

know it only applies to 21 of the 800

Lots in that park so it's a safety net

that only catches 3% of people just like

the one they use at my favorite circus a

pile of dead trapeze artists it's fun

for the whole family unless you're a

family of one of those trapeze artists

and if you think it well look that's

terrible but if those women live in

mobile homes why don't they just move

well there is a problem with that as one

of those women will tell you although

they call them mobile homes it would

cost twenty thousand to move this home

out here plus it went once you move them

in and they settle moving a mouth

couldn't help destroy them she's right

it can cost thousands of dollars to move

mobile homes if you can move them at all

that is why 80% of mobile homes never

move so mobile homes are mobile about as

much as a king crab is an actual king

it's just not except in some parts of

Alaska where it wills the power of a

despot but even then it constitutionally

shares power with moose Parliament so so

King is really a more ceremonial title

there Alaska's a fascinating place and

this this lack of mobility for tenants

is actually part of the attraction for

big investors and to see just how

cynical and predatory the industry can

be meet Frank Rolfe his company is one

of the largest park operators in the

u.s. controlling over 30,000 home sites

in 25 states Roth is an evangelist for

the wonders of mobile home park

investing just look at this

uplifting message that he made ahead of

the 2012 election about what it would

mean for his industry taped for some

reason in front of a shitty green-screen

Oval Office if Mitt Romney wins things

are good but if Barrack Obama wins

things are good

you see it doesn't much matter who wins

the election all that matters is that

the statistics show that Americans will

continue to get poorer in that lower

half of the population Wow what

president wet webcam is essentially

saying there is no matter what happens

the poor will suffer and we will feast

on their rich marrow and as you can see

it's casual Friday here at the White

House which is why I sit before you

looking like a divorced dad at a

parent-teacher conference Roth is

completely shameless about the degree to

which his business depends on having a

captive customer base positively

comparing it to running a Waffle House

where everyone is chained to the booths

a concept so deeply chilling I think it

may have just inspired jaws and peels

next movie now now you should know Ralph

maintains that that line was taken out

of context in fact he has a whole page

on his website about it claiming he was

just talking about the incredibly

consistent revenues in mobile home parks

so he wasn't suggesting that he's a

heartless person whose customers are

stuck there with him holding all the

cards deciding for himself how high he

wants their rent to go to see him say

that you'd need to enroll in his online

mobile home university which we did and

found seminars like this but I found it

again just as a heartless person is that

you know the customers are stuck there

they don't have any option they can't

afford to move the trailer they don't

have three grand so they're the only way

they can they can object to your Rhett

raises to walk off and leave the trailer

in which case it becomes abandoned

property and you recycle if another

person in it so you really hold all the

cards so the question is what do you

want to do how high do you want to go

Wow

usually when someone is that

contemptuous of poor people there

immediately visited by the ghost of

Christmas future

now now maybe maybe Roth will claim that

that quote is out of context - and that

he's not arguing that they're hostages

to hear him say that you need to send

away for Roth's

audio seminar on running mobile home

parks which we also did and found

thick's were the big drivers to making

money is is the ability increased the

RET we didn't have them hostage if they

weren't stuck in those homes and though

in the

mobile home labs it'd be a whole

different picture Frank rolls mobile

home university is basically a crash

course in how to be an asshole although

having taken that course I'd argue that

if that's what you're looking for save

your money and just follow Piers Morgan

on Twitter for one afternoon

isn't just online if you attend his

mobile home bootcamp he'll even take you

on a field trip to love a park when you

get to the park you'll be shocked and

turned off by for example the beach

towel in the window instead of an actual

curtain that doesn't mean anything well

you got to worry about are the following

items infrastructure density expense age

of home and location got it they're

teaching people about mobile home parks

oh yeah that's good no it isn't done

it's really not good telling that woman

that people are just there to learn

about mobile home parks is like telling

a lobster people came to the restaurant

to learn about crustacean habitats

that's good are those knives and forks

to help remove these tiny rubber bands

from her claws no they're going to eat

you

so with that woman and many mobile home

residents like her in danger of having

their lives turned upside down it is

worth asking is there anything that can

be done here well one potential solution

is for residents to band together and

buy their own Park keeping it out of the

hands of speculators or developers and

while that sounds inherently like a long

shot there are nonprofit groups that

have had real success in helping tenants

get financing to do just that

what would help is to have laws in every

state that give residents the right of

first refusal and time to raise funds if

the current owner plans to sell but

until laws like that are put in place

which they absolutely should be there

are some key things to bear in mind if

you want to rent a mobile home that's

fine if you can afford to buy one and

put it on land that you own that's fine

but buying a mobile home and renting the

land underneath it can be financially

catastrophic and it is very important

that anyone considering doing that knows

the risks involved and I'll tell you

what would have been helpful all along

if the marketing for these homes had

always made those risks completely clear

you bought a mobile home

today's manufactured home I can't

believe you bought a house I really did

it it's exactly like a house and what a

beautiful piece of land I don't own the

land though and that's actually a super

important difference look at you all

grown up with the mortgage it's a chat

alone with an astronomical interest rate

the important thing is it's an

investment in your future it'll actually

only ever go down in value and since the

private equity firm bought the park my

rent has skyrocketed are you listening

to me oh I love these decorative bottles

oh that's my blood I have to sell my

blood and plasma in order to make loan

payments

[Applause]

but home is where the sweet potato pie

is I didn't make that did you make that

is that burning your hands are you a

witch I want to see your garden no no no

no don't don't look out there here I go

do it oh there she is look she can't

afford to move you hold all the cards

he's right it's like a Waffle House

where I am chained to my booth that's

house delicious what is wrong with you

speaking of delicious

you

[Applause]

you

public shaming or as we call it in

England parenting thanks for the

Internet it has never been easier to

pile onto a public shaming in fact it's

now one of America's favorite pastimes

in Wisconsin families photo shoots gone

viral and now it's sparking some outrage

online viral video leads to outrage on

Long Island now the outrage over another

viral video the outrage machine never

seemed to rest as actress Sarah Michelle

Gellar found out some people online are

just looking for an excuse to be angry

wait what did Sarah Michelle Gellar -

I'm already so angry about it actually

don't tell me I just realized I

definitely don't care the point is this

is a golden age of internet shaming

you've probably participated in it if

you've ever been mad at a potential

Oscar host with shitty tweets a company

who made a blackface shirt

a beloved Irish actor who want to commit

embraces murder and an aquarium that

called an otter Thicke a gender-reveal

party that started a wildfire whoever

attacked justice Millette

whoever didn't believe justice Millette

and finally justice Millette we're

basically goldfish except instead of

discovering a new castle in our bowl

every nine seconds we find something new

to be outraged about online and you may

be expecting me to say that all public

shaming is bad but I don't actually

think that when it's well directed a lot

of good can come out of it if someone's

caught doing something racist or a

powerful person is behaving badly it can

increase accountability in fact just

this week it emerged that Tucker Carlson

the answer to the question wanted to

sound thud grew a face I've said some

awful things on a radio show a few years

prior to here tuck still it that meant

he was unfairly caught up in public

shaming the great American outrage

machine is a remarkable thing one day

you're having dinner with your family

imagining everything is fine the next

your phone is exploding with calls from

reporters okay first of all no one

having dinner with Tucker Carlson has

ever imagined that everything was fine

most people's answer to the question if

you could have dinner with anyone living

or dead is Tucker Carlson dead

and if you look into why Tucker was

caught in that outrage machine it's

because he publicly called Iraqis

semi-literate primitive monkeys compared

women to dogs and basically said that

Warren Jeffs who was serving a life

sentence for the sexual assault of his

underage Brides wasn't that bad now

Tucker refused to apologize and all week

long they've been trending hashtags like

boycott Tucker Carlson and fire Tucker

Carlson and Tucker Carlson Fox's Roomba

but that one wasn't technically trending

but I have this weird feeling that it

will be in 20 minutes or so but Tucker

is actually a good example of an

Internet pylon being merited he's a

public figure

he made his comments publicly they are

appalling and he's standing by them but

clearly it's not always that simple

because when misdirected Internet pylons

can completely destroy people's lives so

tonight let's try and talk about the

power of public shaming because often it

is not a famous figure who's on the

receiving end of it on a seemingly daily

basis ordinary people who did not ask

for attention can't get sucked into the

spotlight like this woman did a few

years ago they're calling her the aunt

from hell and the Antichrist an aunt

filed suit against her 12 year old

nephew she claims she broke her wrist

when he jumped into her arms she sued

her young nephew for 127 thousand

dollars that's right 127 thousand

dollars over a hug the aunt's defense

was that when she goes to a cocktail

party now she actually said this was it

she finds it very difficult to hold the

plate when the hors d'oeuvres are passed

because of her wrist that sounds

terrible although I will say this I know

this isn't the point but everyone finds

it very difficult to hold an hors

d'oeuvre plate you have a plate in one

hand a glass of wine in the other how do

you eat do you grab food off the plate

with your teeth like some kind of

trained horse

do you hold the wine in your armpit

while you grab food with the other hand

and then spend the rest of the night

drinking armpit wine

it's an unsolvable puzzle but it is

pretty shitty to force a 12 year old boy

to pay six figures for hugging you too

enthusiastically which is of course what

she didn't actually do that the real

story is much more complicated very

basically her health insurance did not

cover all her massive medical bills so

to cover her costs her best option was

to go through her relatives homeowner's

insurance but to do that she had to name

a person in a lawsuit even though the

kid and his family were completely fine

with it and they would not be required

to pay she actually went on The Today

Show to explain all of this after the

story blew up unfortunately it didn't

seem to undo the damage maybe because

even what she was discussing the actual

facts the Today Show's graphics read

worst aren't ever speaks out which

doesn't really help does it

meanwhile she was being relentlessly

attacked all over the internet meaning

anyone googling her in the future would

likely be inundated by the inaccurate

version of that story which as she will

tell you became a real problem when she

was looking for work it was very

difficult to find another job people

reached out and then canceled interviews

or then said oh we've changed our

direction I've taken had to take certain

measures in order to reestablish myself

and I have a refreshed identity that's a

pretty drastic measure to have to take

so to help her move past this if you do

talk about the show tonight remember to

tag it with the hashtag just a normal

aunt

hashtag aren't from not hell hashtag

Tucker Carlson Fox is grown there was

every reason for her to believe that

refreshing her identity was necessary

because fully two months after she went

on TV to correct the record Fox News was

having this discussion

listen hashtag worst and ever but I will

tell you that she did then come on to

one of the media outlets and say that

she needed she was injured obviously and

wanted to sue the whore homeowners

association but had to or homeowners

insurance and had to name him as the

party and felt bad

about it by the way she fell because he

was so excited to see her he stopped me

Jen I love you I love you what are you

doing there this is the worst aren't

ever but in all seriousness she legally

did the only thing that she could have

done and feels quite remorse about it

but the important thing here is she's

the worst

aunt ever and now I'm not saying those

television personalities are all

terrible people they just want to fill

time more than they want to say things

that are true but at some point it's

incumbent on everyone to consider both

context and consequences if you're going

to pile on in a shaming and I'm not

saying that anything here is easy for

instance did I just publicly shame that

lawyer in the last clip yeah I probably

did and honestly I'm absolutely fine

with that just as I'm fine with calling

him a human popped collar who's every

facial expression says I only wish

greenbook had won more Oscars look let's

be honest we make fun of people

constantly on this show it's a comedy

show although for what it is worth we do

think probably more carefully than you

might imagine

about who we're making fun of why we're

doing it and how we ask ourselves

questions all the time like should we

use their name how much power do they

have and do they have a soul patch that

last one could be a real deal breaker

and I'm not saying that we're perfect at

all you might disagree with choices that

we've made but we have honestly thought

about it and sometimes the decision does

get difficult just look at another major

scandal that broke this week concerning

fraud in college admissions actresses

Felicity Huffman and Lauri Lachlan among

33 wealthy parents accused of bribing

coaches and administrators to get their

kids into elite universities Lachlan and

her husband Massimo Gianelli allegedly

put up half a million dollars in

exchange for getting their two daughters

recruited to the USC crew team even

though they did not participate in crew

okay that is such a weird story I don't

think anyone guess that the next big

celebrity scandal would be aunts Becky

from Full House allegedly spends half a

million dollars so a guy will pretend

her daughter's a good at boats

and incidentally if that's all true

worst aren't ever the truth is I've got

no problem making fun of the parents

accused of doing that or the guy who ran

that service where it gets more

complicated is with the kids how much is

it fair to make fun of them well I would

argue that one of them Olivia Jade is a

public figure

she has nearly one and a half million

followers on Instagram and has worked

with all these companies she's actively

made money off her brand as a fun

relatable college students releasing

videos like this I don't know how much

of school I'm gonna attend but I do want

the experience of like gamedays partying

I don't really care about school as you

guys all know huh okay so even before

what we learned this week that was a

little tone deaf although not quite as

tone death as this sponsored post that

she made for Amazon in which she's

decorated her dorm room at USC with the

letters oj and if you don't see a

connection between the letters oj and

USC maybe it should cost half a million

dollars to get you in there now I'm

comfortable I'm comfortable making those

jokes am i comfortable with the whole

internet piling on her honestly

that kind of depends on how and for how

long if it's death threats and viral

comments then of course not if it

defines her forever that seems unfair

the window for making fun of her is

probably closing although I will say it

should stay open just long enough for me

to tell you one person went to her

Sephora makeup product page and left a

one-star review reading I thought this

would give me the just came from true

practice spend hours rolling on the leg

bro turns out it was all a sham but gets

back

[Music]

that is the difficult thing here when

joining in a pylon there is a lot to

take into account and when millions of

people all feel the need to weigh in and

do it potentially for years the

punishment can be vastly

disproportionate to the offense and

perhaps the best example of this is

Monica Lewinsky two decades ago this

country put her through hell as she will

be the first to tell you overnight I

went from being a completely private

figure to a publicly humiliated one

worldwide I was patient zero of losing a

personal reputation on a global scale

almost instantaneously Wow that has to

be terrifying although in fairness

almost everything is scary when you add

the phrase on a global scale if I said

Karen's ophthalmologist says she's gonna

need reading glasses on a global scale

you would rightly think what the is

going on with Karen's eyes but look

she's not wrong and if you are hazy on

the Monica Lewinsky story at 22 she and

President Clinton began a relationship

that very long story short ended up with

graphic details being made public

through the report by independent

counsel Kenneth Starr and it is

impossible to overstate just how

globally famous Monica and private

details of her life became the media

obsessed over every angle of her story

from tabloid stories like these to

cartoons where microphones pointed at

her face were replaced with penises -

endless late-night comedy jokes look my

hands are not clean here either I wasn't

in the US at the time but ten years

after the fact I was in a Daily Show

piece marking the tenth anniversary of

the scandal above a graphic reading ten

sucking years which is gross it's gross

and many comedians have since publicly

expressed regret about things they said

although one who hasn't and it was among

the most relentless was Jay Leno see

with Monica as President Clinton calls

her my little humid or 1 million samples

of DNA they said is the largest

collection of DNA in the world not

counting Monica Lewinsky's closets and

humidity man I'll tell you people's

clothes are stickier than Monica

Lewinsky's met it was just like you

can't get away with at least one of

these Lewinsky back on her feet and the

Grammy for Best organ recital went to

Monica Lewinsky later those jokes have

not dated well in any sense of the word

and and they're pretty rough especially

coming from a guy who just this week

complained about late night TV saying

he'd like to see a bit of civility come

back you know like that time that he did

a bit with a fake book about Lewinsky

titled the in the Hat and if that's

what he means by civility may I offer my

new book oh the places you can go

yourself Jay Leno and given all of that

it's frankly a miracle that Lewinsky

seems to have emerged with her sense of

humor in tax because when someone

recently tweeted I don't know who Monica

Lewinsky is she replied I'm the chick

from over 125 rap songs which is both

very funny and also technically true

because he's referenced in all these

songs we actually found a hundred and

ninety-three of them and that is and

this may shock you significantly more

rap songs than have mentioned me and to

be honest that kinda feels like a

personal sleight you know what an easy

name to rhyme John I'll show you be gone

Swan Louie Vuitton beef bourguignon lots

of options there you know what also

pretty tight rhyme wise Oliver I don't

want just a piece of want Oliver hitting

all the spots that got mixed like John

Oliver almost nothing but the point

isn't that I should be in more rap songs

although I absolutely should

Lewinsky went through absolute hell to

get to the point where she could make

that joke about being the woman from the

rap songs and it can be easy to forget

just how ferocious and devastating the

public attention was I don't even know

how to begin to describe what it was but

it was to see my face on TV to to read

my name in the newspaper people have no

idea what when this is done what this is

doing this behind the name Monica

Lewinsky there's a person and there is a

family there's so much pain that has

been caused by all this and it is it was

so destructive was so destructive that's

horrifying and it's impossible to

imagine how bad that was but for a

second just try think of the dumbest

thing you did when you were young not

the dumbest thing you got caught doing

the dumbest thing you did the thing

you've stole or cheated on or

accidentally sexted and again I am sorry

mom now imagine hearing about that every

single day for decades on end that's a

little bit of what it was like to be

Monica Lewinsky and I know everything

about the subject of public shaming is

complicated but Monica Lewinsky might

actually be the perfect person to remind

all of us what the consequences can be

to a misdirected flood of public anger

and the reason I know this is that I sat

down with Monica earlier this week and

this is what happened 21 years ago

Monica Lewinsky was at the center of a

media frenzy in recent years she's

reimbursed as a major voice on online

shaming and anti-bullying initiatives

and she was kind enough to recently sit

down with me in a fancy apartment that

neither of us live in so in the last few

years you've been doing a lot of work

related to bullying and people being

shamed is it a problem that you think

has gotten worse absolutely I mean I

think that with the advent of the

internet and of course social media we

now have situations where it's

exacerbated beyond I think what anybody

could have imagined initially and the

anonymity that comes with that that that

sort of unleashed these whole new

personas for people it's if you've got

if you have a chance to come up with a

second persona you decide to come up

with exactly how much of an asshole can

I be amplify every aspect of my

personality by a hundred would you agree

that somewhere on the spectrum of shame

there can be positive effects - I'm just

thinking of people who's bad behavior

hurts others and who might not change

that behavior without public and say

yeah you know it's it's interesting I

mean obviously I've spent a lot of time

thinking about this and we tend to look

at it as this kind of like a binary

question right should we public shame we

shouldn't wait I do think there's a

spectrum of behavior on which we could

kind of sort of judge as a society is

this where shaming is effective to

change social behavior or is it damaging

you you were on the receiving end of one

of the worst internet fueled public

shaming of all time and hopefully in a

way ever how the did you get

through that yeah I I don't actually

know you know I mean it was a shitstorm

it was an avalanche of pain and

humiliation and obviously a I could not

have gotten through it without my family

and eventually when I was allowed to

talk to my friends my friends - and I

think as a 24 years old it was you know

really hard to hold on to a shred of

dignity or self esteem when you know

just the butt of so many jokes I'm being

misunderstood right as that everything

escalated all the all the reaction -

what's it like to see this kind of

character of yourself that has your face

and name but what would bears less and

less relevance to who you actually are

sorry I mean it was just it was I say

extraordinary not with any positive

connotation and I think it was not only

just the slut-shaming not only you know

having had an intimate relationship with

someone who is now describing me in a

way

it was like no young woman would want to

be described there was just also my

looks I mean night I you know was very

about the touch-ups and the makeup

because I like part of my vanity now

comes from just the wound of having been

made fun of for my wait for you know

people saying I I was unattractive and

it was terrifying not only because I was

watching myself or this version of

myself I running away from me I mean

stolen my identity was stolen only a

different way I would not to see that I

wasn't flawed and you know that I didn't

make terrible mistakes or do stupid

things or say stupid things because of

course they did well you know right so

every 22 year-old is some version of an

idiot you just lost a lot of you not

whichever 22 year old is now I'm not you

so it's so mean it's not it's not like I

was this you know perfect angel right

but I watched this sort of

deconstruction of me and rebuilding of

me it's like a transformer almost many

many victims of public shaming say it

affects their ability to earn a living

did that happen to you Oh 150% I mean I

couldn't I couldn't get a job I and that

actually it was you know it was

interesting because I went to graduate

school in 2005 and graduated in 2006

then I thought oh okay now I will begin

my life I will now put being Monica

Lewinsky behind me and move on to be

so-and-so's employee and when I couldn't

find a job you know either somebody

offered me a job for the wrong reasons

like oh you'll be coming to our events

that's your job and there's media there

you know or people saying to me you know

the opposite of well could you get a

letter of indemnification from the

Clintons like because we rely on

government money and Hillary might be

President so really I mean there was

this wide range of not being able to

support myself

and also have a purpose which was which

is equally important to feel that you

you matter in some way is it is it tough

sometimes just to get through it yes the

people dying every year question

no that's probably a fair response to

basically most of the things here is it

tough though sometimes just to get

through a typical day without having to

deal with this because the ubiquity

of references to you is incredible it's

insane I think you know in an in part a

lotta that happened because of this you

know sexist really thing that happened

which is that the scandal was named

after me became named over me so it

meant then anytime that this has been

referenced every single day every single

day in the past 20 years so it may not

be a direct reference to me but because

the investigation and the scandal has my

name I'm then therefore attached to it

did you ever consider changing your name

there were several reasons they didn't I

mean first of all I don't think that it

really would have even worked like when

I was job hunting people even suggested

you know why don't you put a different

name on your CV when you're I thought so

then I'm gonna walk into an office for

an interview and and the person

screaming like a person looks like

Monica Lewinsky you know and be

wondering and you're starting out a

professional relationship on a lie so

there's not that and then lastly I think

it was also a principal in the sense

that Bill Clinton didn't have to change

his name nobody's ever asked him did he

think he should change his name and so I

think that that was an important that's

an important statement you know I'm not

proud of all of the choices I've made in

my life but I'm I'm proud of the person

I am I'm not ashamed of Who I am

and I think that that is as hard as it

has been to have that last name

sometimes and the pain that I have felt

of what it's meant for that other people

in my family who have that last name I

am glad I didn't change it I definitely

don't have your courage or strength of

character I don't know honestly I really

believe you don't know that oh no I

already have a mental list of fake names

that's I'm going to do Alvin I like oh

it's not a great name but I think I can

count off you can you actually could

really carry off Alvin Thank You Monica

oh you think I could too I don't know

about Alvin Oliver that's that's a lot

that's true that's not great my second

one was Jack's no surname no explanation

just jacks I like that I could get

behind that one so let's talk a bit

about like laughing because you joke

about your experiences how long did it

take you to get to the point where you

could do that I think there are stages

you know or things that have happened a

couple years ago a friend of mine had

she and her friend had a 25th friend

over Surrey party and they had met in

the 90s so this party that they had for

all their friends to celebrate their

friendship started in the 90s meant

everybody had to come dressed in is from

the 90s I was like oh

I just thought okay you know so for the

first time in about 18 years I donned a

black beret and went to my friend's

party if it could you know in part

because I thought it was pun was funny

oh it's definitely funny right is that

not a marker for actually having come a

long way though that you're able to

actively participate in humor connected

to what you went through which again to

reiterate was clearly anything yeah I

like beret things I can laugh at other

item of clothing jokes not as much what

is your experience of the internet now

because because you you're on Twitter

now and you're very funny on thank you

so how did you decide to go on it cuz

like I guess some of the times that I

get really deflated what do you tweet

something funny and then making the

mistake of scrolling down oh yeah it can

become a sewer pretty fast yeah it can I

mean I I get a lot of empowerment out of

blocking people so I wish people would

not say shitty things but they do sure

and literally to me it's like when I

block someone I'm like going oh really

that's literally what it feels like for

me is that I'm basically telling someone

to off

it feels great so I mean I wish they

hadn't said something that would make me

want to block them to begin with but

blocking is unbelievably empowering I

mean actually I I was lucky in some ways

that social media wasn't around I think

that would have made it worse in some

ways and I don't have made it worse I

know I do not maxed out

it could be do you really think it could

ago was I guess maybe you know I I don't

I don't know so I mean it might have

been worse in the sense that there

certainly would have been a lot more

opinions that were out there but where

it may have been better would have been

that I think I would have heard some

support from people so it might have

been a little more balanced so would it

have been really meaningful to you at

the time had social media being around

just to have a stranger tweet something

like I think what you're going through

is complete yeah yeah it would

absolutely because one of the things

that happens with these kinds of

experiences is that you just you start

to disappear you start to feel like you

don't matter and I think that when

somebody sees you you know and just

acknowledges your humanity in the

smallest way it really can make a world

of difference you don't know it could

help save someone's life and they think

that's important what would your advice

be to someone who is either in the eye

right now of the storm of public shaming

or a kid who's being humiliated at

school online is there anything that

you'd be able to tell them from your

personal experience that nobody else

could the first thing I'd probably say

is that you can get through it you can

move past it I know it feels like in

this one moment that your life will

forever be defined by this but it won't

and it may be hard it may take more time

than you ever could have imagined but

you can move past something like this

Monica Lewinsky thank you so much for

talking

[Applause]

[Laughter]

[Applause]

you

druks

on one hand America's war on them has

been a complete catastrophe but on the

other hand it did give us this photo of

Nancy Reagan sitting on mr. T's lap so

it wasn't a complete loss and by the way

I pity the fool that didn't think they

were gonna after that specifically

specifically we're going to talk about

opioids and if you're thinking hold on

didn't you do a show on this before yeah

we did one two and a half years ago but

tonight we're gonna do an update for a

couple of key reasons first the epidemic

is very much ongoing in 2017 opioid

overdoses killed more than 47,000

Americans and second since then we've

learned a lot more about many of the

companies involved if something's been

amazing for instance a criminal case

involving executive in the drunk maker

iNSYS on earth they rap video allegedly

made to motivate their sales force to go

out and sell a painkiller containing the

highly addictive drug fentanyl take a

look

[Music]

you like silent all beasts yes Beast but

but let's just stop for a moment there

to unpack the line if you're trying to

ball I'll substitute you like a xylitol

that is a reference to the key

ingredient in sugar-free gum it is

astonishingly almost impossibly lame it

is genuinely difficult to come up with a

rap that is languor than that and I'll

show you

splash rules everything around me Hank's

get the mermaid Daryl Daryl Hannah y'all

now if that like is that like yes it is

is it lamer than the interest video I

think it's hard for you to make that

case and that rap video was just the tip

of the iceberg in terms of new

information now coming out through

numerous court cases so tonight let's

pull a few of these new revelations

together and look at what we've learned

about how the first wave of the opioid

crisis began because it's a story of how

major companies acted wildly

irresponsibly skirted any meaningful

consequences and for the most part

avoided public scrutiny let's start with

drug distributors these are the big

three that the companies responsible for

getting drugs to pharmacies and

hospitals they're supposed to alert

authorities if they notice suspicious

orders of controlled substances but for

a sense of just how badly they failed to

do that look at Kermit West Virginia

named of course because it's where come

at the Frog lives with this secret

second family oh that's right

he's in a throuple with two salamanders

named Francois and Gary and they are

very very happy it was it was never you

Miss Piggy it was him the amount of

opioids sent to Kermit a town of just

400 people was utterly ridiculous this

undercover video of Kermit's main

pharmacy shows scores of people picking

up prescriptions inside and at the

drive-thru window more than three

million doses of hydrocodone were

ordered by a Kermit pharmacist James

Wooley in one year it's true three

million doses to a town of 400 people

that's around 7500 pills for every

resident in Kermit and just to be clear

we mean every resident in comets not

every resident in Kermit Kermit

kermin is a top I'll have you know not

that that is any of your business but

those sorts of figures clearly should

have caught the attention of

distributors in fact the largest one

McKesson alone shipped five million

doses of opioids to Kermit in just two

years and that's just one example of

mcKesson's reckless behavior and the

problem is at no point will they

effectively deterred in 2008 the DEA

alleged that McKesson had failed to

control its controlled substances

McKesson agreed to pay a thirteen

million dollar fine that's all without

admitting wrongdoing and also promised

to do better by implementing a

controlled substances monitoring program

but that program emphatically did not

work in fact a DEA official later wrote

their bad acts had continued and

escalated to a level of egregious 'no

seen before because of course they did

you can't put McKesson in charge of

monitoring McKesson if the Bears in your

zoo get out at night and start mauling

the other animals you don't deputize one

of the Bears to monitor the situation

and I know what you're thinking but John

I've already brought him a little

Sheriff's outfit to wear and I think he

looked great in it and yes of course he

would but at the end of the day bears

are gonna bear it's just in their nature

and again before you say well I've spent

quite a bit of money designing a

custom-made sheriff's badge just for him

don't you think the bear will recognize

the gravitas of that symbol and feel

compelled to grow and change his bear

ways in some way no I don't because

bears respect nothing they they think

the importance that we place on symbols

and status makes us weak they value

nothing but blood and strength and I

know what you're gonna say now is there

anything I can do the answer is of

course not because while you were

talking

sheriff bear more due to death you're

dead now goodbye why are we still

talking about this the point is McKesson

monitoring itself clearly did not work

because in 2017 they wound up agreeing

to another fine bigger this time a

hundred and fifty million dollars this

time which yes sounds like a lot until

you realize that that is less than one

1000th of their revenue for one year and

well well today McKesson says that

they've improved their monitoring

systems for realsies this time pinky

promise

and and they argue that they weren't the

ones setting the demand for opioids at

any point even the DEA agent in charge

of their case thought that their

settlement was absurd how do you settle

how do you say it's okay just here write

this check this time and close this

place for a little bit sign this piece

of paper how do you do that no put him

in jail he's right

put him in jail and obviously I'd watch

an entire show that he's just that guy

telling me where to put things

McKesson executives put them in jail

these carrots put them in soup this

group of corgis put them in tiny boots

they should be boots but that is the big

problem here for companies involved in

the opioid crisis finds just became the

cost of doing business and throughout

this crisis it has been difficult to

find any real accountability for the

people involved and there may be no more

frustrating example of that than Purdue

Pharma the manufacturer behind oxycontin

the drug that arguably kick-started this

crisis Purdue famously aggressively

marketed oxycontin to doctors as a less

addictive painkiller that could be used

to treat common conditions like back

aches and knee pain which was obviously

untrue would be like using cocaine for a

toothache which incidentally back in the

1800's people actually did what an idea

that was my tooth hurt this morning but

I took some medicine and now I'm really

psyched about 20 different

business ideas I'm gonna write a

screenplay

[Applause]

Purdue Purdue is owned by members of the

Sackler family collectively they're

worth an estimated 13 billion dollars

which has enabled them to proudly slap

their name on some truly impressive

monuments to other people's talent the

Sackler name is on parts of the Met the

Louvre the Museum of Natural History the

National Gallery in London the Royal

College of Art and Institute jail a

library Oxford and exactly crossing at

the Royal Botanic Gardens not bad for a

family whose very name sounds like a

Hamburglar

like villain that steals testicles no

the Sackler came in the middle of the

night and now my penis is shivering the

sackless love putting their names on

things although until very recently

they've been miraculously good at

keeping their name off the opioid crisis

but that is now changing with protests

like this in New York City this weekend

protesters flooded the Guggenheim Museum

they dropped fake prescription slips

from the upper walkway angry that the

museum takes big donations from the

Sackler family which has been accused of

engineering the opioid epidemic Wow I

know this isn't the point but just spare

a thought there for the Guggenheim

janitor who has to clean all that up

Dennis didn't take millions from the

pharmaceutical industry Dennis gets $15

an hour and maybe the occasional chance

to masturbate on a Cezanne no I don't

say it's a good janitor I just said you

should think about it the reason for

this change in public perception is a

dawning realization of just how deeply

some of the suckers were involved

because unlike most second-generation

heirs to a Family Fortunes some were

very hands-on Richard Sackler worked at

Purdue throughout the crisis serving as

president from 1999 to 2003 and served

on the board along with seven other

family members and now thanks to a

number of lawsuits filed by various

states we're getting glimpses of the

depth of Richards involvement

Massachusetts alleges that Richard

Sackler at one point demanded to be sent

into the field with sales reps on visits

to doctors in fact his micromanagement

was apparently so extreme that Purdue's

VP of Sales and Marketing wrote to the

CEO anything you can do to reduce the

direct contact of Richard into the

organization is appreciated and going by

some of his statements that

micromanagement was in service of a

pretty clear purpose according to newly

filed court documents when oxycontin was

first released

Richard Sackler Purdue's former

president and son of the company founder

is quoted saying at a company event that

the launch would be followed by a

blizzard of prescriptions amazingly the

full quote is actually worse he calls it

a blizzard of prescriptions that will

bury the competition and then goes on to

say the blizzard will be so deep dense

and white and look as a tagline for

frozen - that's pretty good but it's

troubling when applied to addictive

painkillers and Richard SACNAS

glib tone continued even as Purdue began

to see the consequences of the drugs

that they were pushing at the dawn of

the opioid epidemic when 59 deaths were

reported in a single state Purdue's

President wrote quote this is not too

bad could have been far worse Wow

that is both callous and also completely

beside the point because the phrase it

could have been worse can be applied to

literally anything in fact one of the

only things it cannot apply to is

Richard sackler statement regarding

those 59 deaths and I have to say I'm

just not sure the full horror of that

comment comes across it and when you

just hear a guy read it out on TV and

the problem is we have to use Clips like

that because there are no clips of

Richard Sackler he never does interviews

even that photo is one of only a small

handful we could find and think of how

remarkable that is in and of itself he's

an incredibly rich man and it's

genuinely easier to find multiple image

options of birds standing on Turtles or

babies that look like one is short and

that let's all agree those babies look a

lot like one is short and this this

invisibility feels deliberate and

whether it is or not it has definitely

been convenient for Richard Sackler

because it it's honestly hard to tell

the story of his time at Purdue without

any video there is only so long that

anyone will listen to someone at a desk

reading from court documents trust me I

know that I'm

painfully aware of that so tonight we've

actually done something unusual to help

you get the emotional impact of Richard

SACNAS actual words we've got an actor

to play him so so let's let's try that

last quote again Richard Sackler a news

article about oxycontin addiction says

it's caused 59 deaths in a single state

how do you respond that's not too bad it

could require worse that's right

we've got Michael Keaton because

when you're casting for a shadowy heir

to a vast fortune who doesn't like to be

in the limelight you go Batman a look

that helps a little bit right here let's

try another one

as evidence mounted that oxy was causing

widespread addiction sackler urged the

company to publicly blame those who were

addicted Michael King what did he

actually write we have to hammer on the

abusers in every way possible

they are the culprits and the problem

they are reckless criminals sackler

genuinely wrote that and not only does

that come off as malicious and

cold-hearted it also doesn't even make

any sense

he's furious at the people who are part

of the problem but the people he's angry

at helps make him incredibly rich you

don't see Adam Levine releasing a song

condemning horny middle-aged women

because that would be hypocritical who

do you think made you who you are Adam

it's you're just dangerous enough for

suburban moms to masturbate to energy

that got you where you are today show

some respect to your base son now now

for legal reasons I have to tell you the

sack listen Purdue insist the family

didn't cause the opioid crisis and

vigorously deny the claims in the

lawsuits that we've mentioned saying

that Richard sackless comments have been

taken out of context with quotes

cherry-picked from among tens of

millions of other emails and business

documents but two things about that

because first whenever they've added

context it hasn't really helped much for

instance their explanation for sackless

saying the news of 59 deaths was not too

bad was that he was merely commenting

about the nature of recent press

coverage which is not better in any

meaningful way whatsoever as for that

Blizzard of prescriptions line they've

claimed the full context for that is

that his remarks were an allusion to his

delayed arrival at that event due to the

well-known blizzard of 1996 which again

in no way exonerate him oh hey guys it's

not like Richard was recklessly and

callously anticipating oxycontin's

popularity while it was sunny out it was

snowing hello and the thing is for a

family that complaints about a lack of

context they are thought tirelessly to

withhold it because time and time again

they've settled cases on the condition

that evidence will be sealed and

unavailable to the public in fact a few

years back Purdue settled a lawsuit with

Kentucky on the condition that the state

AG destroyed

17 million pages of documents 17 million

pages that's an actual Blizzard of

context that they did not want anyone to

see and you can kind of see why because

just the glimpses of information that

we've seen recently resulted in that

Guggenheim protest which in turn led to

the museum deciding to stop taking

funding from the sackless and the

Guggenheim is not the only institution

that's cutting ties the Sackler xand

London's National Portrait Gallery have

mutually agreed to call off a planned

1.3 million dollar donation it's true

the National Portrait Gallery bailed on

the stackless too and I know that as

punishments go getting to keep 1.3

million dollars doesn't sound all that

bad but keep in mind that these

people have infinite money and seem to

enjoy nothing more than using it to

purchase social status so not getting to

put their name on things maybe a real

punishment to them but I would argue

that that

only be half of it the other half is

having to put their name on the opioid

crisis that they fought so hard to

distance themselves from and that public

accounting is starting to become

possible despite the fact the Richard

Sackler has barely appeared in public

and there's actually a tantalizing

development here because a few weeks ago

the transcript of a video deposition

that Richard Sackler gave in that

Kentucky case the case remember we're 17

million documents were destroyed least

to ProPublica and stat news this is it

right here

this is the thing that Purdue really did

not want anyone to see and there is some

damning stuff in here the really

effective thing would be to see the

video of this deposition but Purdue is

fighting for Rochas lis hard to keep it

under seal which benefits them as you've

seen tonight newscasters reading quotes

will only get you so far

but we have the deposition and you

should know Michael Keaton is not the

only actor we got to play Richard sacker

in fact we got multiple actors to read

parts of his deposition word-for-word

and who better to convey the arrogance

of an early exchange about SACNAS

involvement in Purdue than someone

responsible for playing one of the

greatest drug dealers in there in the

history of television on July 30th of

2014 were you a director of Purdue

Pharma Inc mmm not that I'm aware this

is an affidavit filed in the Southern

District of West Virginia and does that

appear to be your name that does and

it's dated July 30 2014 it says

declaration of dr. Richard S Sackler I

am a director of Purdue Pharma Inc the

General Partner of Purdue Pharma LP I've

held this position since 1990 that's

what it says them that's what it says

Wow Richard Sackler came off like a real

dick there right certainly more so than

if I just read that to you and since we

had Bryan Cranston we didn't stop there

because this deposition also contains an

excerpt of a speech that Sackler gave

when oxycontin was launched bragging

about how quickly Purdue got the FDA to

approve it so we had him go full Walter

why

on that one too this didn't just happen

it was a definitely coordinated planned

event that took dozens of workers years

of effort to succeed the most demanding

new drug approval package for any

analgesic product ever submitted didn't

languish at the agency unlike the years

that other filings linger at FDA this

product was approved in 11 months 14

days our previous best approval time for

other products was measured in years not

months

I felt that in my bones I look

sure we could have stopped there those

those two actors were already incredible

but then we remembered this is HBO and

if we want someone to read this out

of another email that Richard Sackler

wrote this one characterizing his

devotion to oxycontin we have access to

the cost of another iconic drug drama so

brace yourselves everyone because all

are coming to make oxycotin a huge

success

it is almost and I've dedicated my life

to it

indeed I look the only problem here is

all of these actors are pretty cool and

Richard Sackler decidedly is not and so

to embody the fact that he responded I

don't know more than a hundred times

during his deposition

we asked Richard kind to read just a

selection of them how much money has

Purdue Frederick or Purdue farmer made

off the sale of I suppose I don't know

you know how much the sacral family is

made off the sale of oxy time I don't

know who's Lydia Johnson I don't know I

don't know I don't know I don't know how

many produ entities are there I don't

know

pretty effective right look Richard

Sackler might say hey that's not fair

I didn't sound like that but we don't

know if he sounded like that if we can't

see the tape which is why he should

absolutely allow it to be released but

if he doesn't we can only imagine what

was going on during his deposition for

instance maybe he was sloppily eating a

turkey sandwich during this actual

exchange about oxycontin addiction

have you made any effort or as we sit

here today do you know how many patients

who took oxycontin in Kentucky became

dependent or addicted no do you believe

that an appropriate number of patients

or an excessive number of patients who

took oxycontin in Kentucky became

addicted or dependent No do you know or

has Purdue made any effort to ascertain

how many people who were started on

oxycontin wound up becoming dependent

and moving on to heroin at some point no

why would he eat a sandwich during such

a serious deposition I mean yes maybe he

didn't but it would be so easy for

Richard Sackler to prove that he didn't

the point is until he does that we've

uploaded a bunch of videos of four

different Richard SACNAS reading

extracts from his emails and deposition

to sackler Gallery com which I'm sure

they'll enjoy they love having their

names

we've all something to various state

lawsuits at the site so you can read

them yourself the point here is Richard

sackless deposition should not be

something that Purdue gets to bury like

it's buried so many other things over

the years so please go to the website

and watch and use the clips as you see

fit

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

the Republican National Convention in

Cleveland the most apocalyptic thing

ever to happen to that city and bear in

mind their River has repeatedly caught

fire now it has been over for a few days

but we thought it might be worth taking

a few extra minutes to try and figure

out what the just happened because

you know you are dealing with a pretty

unconventional convention when a speaker

opens with this statement my name is

Dina white I am the president of the

Ultimate Fighting Championship the only

way that would have made sense is if his

next words were and I have clearly

sleepwalked here please gently walk me

from the stage and return me to my

family they are very worried now he was

actually there to speak to Donald

Trump's business acumen a repeated theme

throughout the whole week he gets stuff

done Donald Trump is a proven leader

innovator entrepreneur when Donald Trump

is in charge all that counts is ability

effort and excellence he has created

jobs for thousands and is one of the

greatest visionaries of our time now now

before you laughs you cannot say Trump

isn't a visionary for a long time he was

the only one who envisioned himself as a

presidential nominee he is basically

what happens if the secret gets into the

wrong hands but that message of Trump as

a skilled manager was somewhat undercut

by the fact the entire convention was a

mismanaged show from Melania Trump

using a partly plagiarized speech to Ted

Cruz being booed off the stage for not

endorsing Donald Trump to the fact that

supposedly Donald Trump knew Ted Cruz

wouldn't endorse him and didn't care the

decision came as no surprise to Trump

who tweeted I saw his speech two hours

early but let him speak anyway nobody

deal yeah but that's not reassuring if

the captain of the Titanic who tweeted

after the fact I saw that iceberg two

hours before and sailed into it anyway

no big deal

you wouldn't think well that captain's

sure ran a tight ship we are it's

actually fitting that Trump had

seemingly done so little to prepare for

his party's convention giving that the

party itself had done so little to

prepare for Donald Trump after the last

election the GOP published a post-mortem

report titled the growth and opportunity

project analyzing their mistakes and

laying out a plan to expand their appeal

now it featured passages like many

minorities wrongly think that

Republicans do not like them or want

them in the country and we must

emphasize the importance of a welcoming

inclusive message in particular when

discussing issues that relate directly

to a minority group unfortunately over

the past year that report and it's

carefully considered suggestions has

been overshadows by a different report

titled literally everything Donald Trump

has ever said and done because this is a

guy who suggested building a wall to

keep Mexicans out and advocated a

temporary ban on Muslims entering the

country so it's like making a new year's

resolution to eat healthy and then

spending the next year only eating meals

so large that they're free if you eat

them in one sitting but amazingly

through all the chaos and confusion this

week one theme did emerge and it was

accidentally summarized best and I can't

believe I'm saying this but Antonio

sabato jr. an IMDB page awarded actor

who delivered a relatively restrained

speech before opening his hearts

regarding President Obama to ABC News

first of all I don't believe that the

guy is a Christian I don't believe you

follows the guy that I love and the

Jesus that I love usually my President

Obama is a Muslim option is that what

you're saying absolutely and that is

based on what you feel in your art

that's what I believe yeah you know what

I have the right to believe that and you

have the right to go against that but I

believe it

now what revealing there isn't he's

mistaken belief that President Obama is

a Muslim it's also not the big shot that

Antonio sabato jr. star of the actual

vh1 reality show

Mayan

tonio is still both alive and an idiot

know what is truly revealing is his

implication that believing something to

be true is the same as it being true

because if anything that was the theme

of the Republican convention this week

it was a four day exercise in

emphasizing feelings over facts people

around the country feel the Obama

administration is kick them to the curb

our country right now is now in a very

bad spot you can feel it the vast

majority of Americans today do not feel

safe there's a lot of Americans out

there who feel like Democrat politicians

have taken them for granted the whole

economy feels stuck what do you mean it

feels stuck the economy is about numbers

feelings are supposed to be irrelevant

incidentally feelings are supposed to be

irrelevant is a phrase that's inscribed

on every British marriage certificate

and this focus this focus on feelings

reached its apex in Donald Trump's

acceptance speech which was light on

concrete policy but heavy on provoking

strong emotions decades of progress made

in bringing down crime are now being

reversed I know that corruption has

reached a level like never ever before

in our country poverty and violence at

home war and destruction abroad 180,000

illegal immigrants with criminal records

order deported from our country are

tonight roaming free to threaten

peaceful citizens holy he sounds

like he's about to announce the first

annual Hunger Games but look it is worth

noting that since President Obama took

office crime rates the flow of illegal

immigrants over our borders and claims

for unemployment benefits have all

declined and get frightening Lee when

reporters started pointing that out it

didn't seem to matter just watch as Newt

Gingrich brushed off any effort to

fact-check Trump's claims about the u.s.

crime rate violent crime is down the

economy is down it is not down in the

big

city's violent crime murder rate is down

how comes then how come it's up in

Chicago up in Baltimore there are

pockets where certain certainly we are

not time capital your third or third

biggest city violent crime across the

country is down the average American I

will bet you this morning does not think

crime is down does not think they are

safer but it is we are safer and it is

done no that's your view I just don't

know either I should but what I should

know what I said also effect no it isn't

no it isn't it's only a fact that that's

a feeling people have this is a graph of

the violent crime rate it's not asking

Rorschach test because infer anything

you like from it and sure you can

cherry-pick

recent optics in some cities but the

overall trend across the country during

the Obama presidency and indeed for the

last 25 years is down but Newt wasn't

done the current view is that liberals

have a whole set of statistics which

theoretically may be right but it's not

we're human beings it but what you're

saying it but hold on but Mr Speaker

because you're saying liberals use these

numbers they use this sort of magic map

this is the FBI statistics they're not a

liberal organization they're but what I

showed is equally true people feel it

more threat they feel it but the facts

don't support it as a political

candidate I'll go with how people feel

and I'll let you go with the

theoreticians he brought he just brought

a feeling to a f--king fact fight and it

is worth taking um just a moment to

seriously consider what Gingrich was

saying there because think about it I

think we can all agree that candidates

can create feelings in people and what

Gingrich is saying is that feelings are

as valid as facts so then by the

transitive property candidates can

create facts which is terrifying because

that means someone like Donald Trump can

essentially create his own reality and

that is the closest thing to an actual

magic spell I think I've ever seen

and if you're thinking we'll hold on

eventually reality will set in because

if elected Trump would actually have to

deal with facts but I'm not so sure

about that

just this week The Times reported that

not only was John Kasich asked if he had

any interest in the vice presidency by

the Trump campaign he was offered quite

a lot more Donald Trump jr. even called

one of john Kasich's top aides and said

that if he wanted the job he could even

be in charge of foreign and domestic

policy which of course is kind of

everything yeah exactly

the only thing that is not foreign

policy or domestic policy is space

policy which leads me to believe Donald

Trump's entire goal is to eventually own

the moon but but it gets better because

apparently when k-6 advisors asked what

Trump would be in charge of the response

was making America great again which

objectively is not a job but I guess it

feels like one and it seems that's all

the King matters now now the Trump

family disputed that story naturally but

it does often seem like Trump is more

interested in attention than the hard

work of getting things done in a

complicated political system just last

night he tweeted out what seemed to be

his main takeaway from this convention

okay okay first 24 out of 75 is 32% not

33 but that doesn't matter that clearly

doesn't matter the point is look the

point the notion that Donald Trump would

be a hands-off president might actually

represent the best-case scenario here

the much more frightening prospect would

be if he were hangs on because between

those 24 minutes of applause was a

symphony of bile and race-baiting

remember this is the man who has

retaliated against journalists and at

various points has advocated killing

terrorists families endorse torture and

expressed admiration for leaders like

Kim jong-un Saddam Hussein and Vladimir

Putin his message this week was the

message of every strong man ever the

world is dangerous and only I can make

you safe and if that sounds scary

there have been warning signs just watch

this DVD extra from the first season of

The Apprentice it's a it's a music video

they made and it gives you a sense of

how Donald Trump envisions himself this

is a dictatorship and I'm depicted

no boating's there's no jury oh sure hey

it's funny now to hear him say he's a

dictator as a voice in the background

says slave to the master over and over

again but unless we're careful by this

time next year that could be America's

new national anthem

you

tobacco it used to be a cornerstone of

American life it was how we knew sex was

over before the female orgasm was

invented even if you didn't smoke you

could not escape those who did

cigarettes were in the hands of trusted

news men beloved cartoon characters and

cowboys in TV commercials you've had

your supper and coffee the horses are

settling down you settle back you start

to think about Saturday night in town

come to where the flavor is is the

iconic Marlboro Man as synonymous with

ruggedness and freedom as he was with

dying from smoking-related diseases

because and this is true that's what

happened to at least four of the actors

who played him for dead actors it's like

if there was a gas leak on whose line is

it anyway

you could have mitt it is weird seeing

those cigarette ads now and that's

because for the past half century

America has steadily limited how tobacco

companies are able to behave we've put

warning labels on packaging and banned

cigarette ads from TV

all while tobacco executives defended

themselves against hard public health

questions it's true the babies born from

women who smoke are smaller but they're

just as healthy as the babies Lord for

women pregnant ladies enough cigarettes

and you're pretty much just shooting out

Lego babies they fit in Star Wars toys

who wouldn't want that that's adorable

by the late 90s the regulations were

such that tobacco companies here

voluntarily retired not just the

Marlboro Man but also Joe Camel who

people had ridiculously accused of being

targeted at children just because he was

an adorable cartoon camel who dressed

like the Fonz and smoked

all these restrictions help lower

smoking rates in the u.s. from about 43

percent in 1965 to 18 percent today

which you would assume would decimate

the American tobacco industry which is

what makes this clip from 2008 so

surprising tobacco is what you might

call smoking hot is this the best time

ever to be a tobacco farm probably most

profitable Wow

so it's an aging product that's

decreasing in popularity and yet somehow

it just can't stop making money it's

basically the agricultural equivalent of

you two now now one of the reasons one

of the reasons for this might be the

while Americans are smoking less in some

parts of the world's people are smoking

more to an occasionally shocking extent

you might remember this viral video

video of this two-year-old boy he's just

puffing away on a cigarette in Indonesia

and it's gone completely viral the mom

says he is totally addicted and if he

doesn't get the smokes he gets angry he

starts banging his head on the wall yeah

of course he gets mad when you take away

his smokes he thinks they're gone he

doesn't have object permanence yet the

smoking baby was such a media sensation

news crews from across the world

attempted to find him just across this

bridge lies the small fishing village

that is home to the smoking baby we

briefly caught up with Aldi and his

mother Diana at the airport flanked by a

local TV crew are you Aldi hi I'm Dan

are you doing a little dude holy

just look at that kid he's his own Rat

Pack all he's missing is three other

kids dressed like him and a casino

and this is where this story gets really

interesting because that baby's favorite

brand of cigarettes was a mild which is

owned by Philip Morris International the

company that sells Philip Morris brands

everywhere but america they like other

multinational companies have flocked to

indonesia a market where two-thirds of

adult males smoke and there are very few

restrictions and I do mean very few this

really brings home the point this is the

entrance to a school and come with me

just a few steps away from the entrance

there is this kiosk that is sponsored by

marlboro lights and at this kiosk a

student can come and buy an individual

cigarette they're only a dime apiece and

they even have a lighter on a string of

course the lighters on a string what

kind of irresponsible cigarette vendor

outside of school would let a child walk

away with a lighter they're dangerous

think about it just think about that and

look Indonesia is far from the only

country where Philip Morris

International or PMI has expanded they

own seven of the world's top 15

international brands including Marlboro

and recently Marlboro has boosted its

global market share thanks to its

worldwide don't be a maybe be Marlboro

campaign and if you're thinking what the

factors don't be a maybe mean please let

this video by the people responsible for

the campaign explain it to you as a

brand Marlboro was not resonating with

adult smokers even though its values of

freedom authenticity and master of

destiny work smokers missed the essence

of the cowboy which led us to our

opportunity

eliminate the word maybe for more

smokers vocabulary to become the

catalyst that inspires smokers from just

thinking about life to taking the lead

in their life to live the Marlboro

values to be true and forever

that is a pile of horseshit even Don

Draper looks at that ad and goes pull it

back a little bit

these are cigarettes we're talking about

not Jesus now now countries can try to

counteract the influence of that kind of

marketing but if tobacco companies feel

too threatened they'll put them through

legal hell let me take you on a world

tour of how they attack laws intended to

protect public health because it's kind

of amazing let's start in Australia in

2011 they passed a plain packaging law

and what that means is this cigarettes

come in packaging like this pretty drab

coloring messaging the Australian

government writes pictures it chooses

the brand name they're really relegated

to the bottom Australia's plain

packaging law bans tobacco company

branding from packaging and replaced it

with upsetting photos such as the toe

tack on a corpse the cancerous mouth the

nightmarish eyeball or the diseased lung

now oh yeah yes I'm pretty sure I would

find a healthy lung disgusting but but

that thing does look like you're trying

to breathe through baked ziti so just

take take it out just take take it down

perhaps unsurprisingly since this law

was implemented total consumption of

tobacco and cigarettes in Australia fell

to record lows and nightmares about

eyeballs have risen to record highs take

it down take down the demon eye

to get these laws though Australia's had

to run a gamut of lawsuits first to

tobacco companies sued Australia in its

highest court to stop them the result

was a little surprising as Australia's

attorney-general let everyone know I'm

delighted to be able to say that we have

won that legal action and just as some

icing on the cake

it seems that the big tobacco companies

will also be required to pay the

government's cost yes even if that

little guy is the sixth largest country

in the world in terms of land mass and

and the tobacco companies didn't just

lose the judges caught their case

delusive under alien synthetic and said

it had fatal defects which sounds a

little like the early reviews of NBC's

The Slap what is this thing how long am

I supposed to watch it for which one is

the slap Australia's legal troubles were

just beginning because then Philip

Morris Asia got involved the company is

threatening to take the Australian

government to an international court and

says that removing brands from cigarette

packs will lower the value of its

trademark and intellectual property

that's right a company was able to sue a

country over a public health measure

through an international court how the

is that possible well it's really a

simple explanation they did it by

digging up in 1993 trade agreement

between Australia and Hong Kong which

had a provision that Australia couldn't

seize Hong kong-based company's property

so nine months before the lawsuit

started PMI put its Australian business

in the hands of its Hong kong-based

Philip Morris Asia division and then

they sued claiming that the seized

property in question were the trademarks

on their cigarette packages and you've

got to give it to them that's impressive

someone should really give those lawyers

a pat on the back and a punch in the

face but flat on the back first punch

punch little pat big pucks that's what

that leads but but wait there is more

here because you will never guess who

else is coming after Australia three

governments Honduras the Dominican

Republic and Ukraine have five

complaints with the World Trade

Organization against Australia's plain

packaging laws that's right

Ukraine is charging Australia with

hurting its tobacco exports something

which was a bit of a surprise to a

Ukrainian Member of Parliament when I

first read about the position of the

government it seems to be a joke because

we have a zero trade exchange between

Australian Ukraine of any tobacco Goods

0 right 0 so Ukraine is inserting

themselves into something they have

nothing to do with they're taking the

kanye west approach to international

traders the truth is as you have

probably guessed by now tobacco

companies have encouraged these suits

even covering some of the legal costs

meaning the tobacco industry is treating

Ukraine like a stage parent treats a

child in a beauty pageant

although no brandy wants to do it yes I

paid for an outfit and I pushed her onto

the stage but this was all her idea

and I swear to god brandy if you drop

that flaming baton you are king walking

home you walk home brandy tobacco

companies aren't just going after big

countries like Australia Philip Morris

has also launched a legal challenge

against the small South American country

of Uruguay for damaging its business

prospects Uruguay has a population of

just three and a half million people and

is a relatively tiny cigarette market

that's right Philip Morris International

is currently suing Uruguay a country

that you think about so little that you

didn't even notice that that's not

Uruguay this is Yoruba

nine years ago

your guys started introducing

increasingly larger health warnings

smoking rates dropped and uruguayan like

the laws with 68% of smokers saying that

they should be stronger but just because

they wanted it hasn't stopped PMI from

suing them for the past five years and

that's a lot for a small country to take

on luckily they have had help the way of

Uruguay has received the support of the

World Health Organization and the Pan

American Health Organization as well as

the mayor of New York City Michael

Bloomberg who donated $500,000 for

payment of attorneys fees the legal fees

were getting so expensive they had to

take money from Michael Bloomberg on the

scale of how shitty that has got to feel

it's just barely higher than borrowing

money from your ex-girlfriends current

boyfriend's stepdad and enforcing

Uruguay to do that was not bad enough

let me tell you what Philip Morris

International has done to Togo Togo is

one of the ten poorest countries on

earth and they recently unveiled some

new tobacco laws ludo goo Togo is

setting conditions on the sale of

tobacco starting on September 1st 2014

packs of cigarettes sold in Togo must

bear warnings in French AV and kPa about

the health risk associated with a

conception of tobacco now a first

written warning sound great until you

learn that 40% of the adult population

of Togo is illiterate which is why some

members of the Togolese government

wanted something more like Australia's

ziti lung packaging take it down take

take it down it's still disgusting but

when they got wind of this Philip Morris

International a company with annual net

revenues of 80 billion dollars basically

threatened to sue Togo whose entire GDP

is 4.3 billion and when your GDP is only

a couple of billion more than the box

office of Avatar a protracted legal case

it's not really what you need now we

actually reached out to Togo and ask to

see their correspondence with the

tobacco companies and they gave us this

letter

EMI we had to translate it from French

but it was worth it because this thing

is almost comically appalled appalling

it informs Togo that plain packaging

laws would result in an incalculable

amount of international trade litigation

suggesting Togo would lose any legal

challenge by citing among other things

an Australian High Court decision which

they write concluded that plain

packaging constitutes a substantial

privation of property rights now the

court case they're referring to is the

one from earlier you remember the one

tobacco companies lost so badly they had

to cover the court costs and yet they

quote the one judge in that case who

ruled in favor of tobacco ignoring the

other six who called their case if you

remember delusive unreal and synthetic

and saying it had fatal defects that's

like when a shitty movie engineers a

good review out of a bad one like

Mordecai is a pile of dot dot dot great

bits letter is and yet Togo

justifiably terrified by threats of

billion dollar settlements backed down

from a public health law that many

people wanted and it's not just Togo

British American Tobacco sent a similar

letter to Namibia and one of their

subsidiaries sent one to the Solomon

Islands a country with a population of

600,000 at this point it's safe to say

if you live in an apartment with at

least two other people and you asked one

of them to please smoke outside you can

look forward to a letter from a tobacco

company very soon

look I could get angry and I could call

tobacco companies assholes or monsters

or open sores on Satan's dick but

instead instead instead let's rise above

it and let's try and broker peace

because it's clear what each side wants

countries want to warn their citizens

about the health dangers of smoking

tobacco tobacco companies want to be

able to present branded images that they

have spent time and money to cultivate

so may I suggest a compromise I present

to you the new face of Marlboro Jeff the

diseased lung in a cowboy hat

we are offering two F to you Philip

Morris International to use as you wish

put him on your billboards put him on

some ads in fact and don't be mad we've

we've already started doing that for you

this is an actual billboards that is in

Montevideo right now and people seem to

like it there because they like it

of course they look everyone loves Jeff

the diseased lung in a cowboy hat oh one

more thing

um to be completely honest we didn't

just do it in Uruguay because we also

and don't be mad we made some Jeff

branded t-shirts and we ship them to

Togo yesterday where they've been quite

a hit and if you don't believe me check

this out

Jeff's already out there you just need

to claim him

our lawyers unlike yours will not sue

and and I know our viewers would love to

help you get the message out there in

fact you can tweet about Jeff using the

hashtag Jeff we can to get in trending

worldwide and get pmos attention post

Jeff's photo on Google+ and tag him Mull

bruh which might push him to the top of

Marlboros Google Image Search we can do

this everyone don't be a maybe about

this

[Applause]

because he's definitely suffering from

emphysema on your stress enough you do

not market to children kids love Jeff

don't you kids

[Applause]

[Applause]

[Applause]

you

professional wrestling literally the

only good excuse to wear a onesie and

that's right babies you're not pulling

it off put on some jeans and a

button-down like a person

specifically I want to talk about the

undisputed corporate champion of

wrestling the WWE formerly known as the

WWF until and this is true they lost a

court case to the World Wildlife Fund

presumably thanks to that funds powerful

team of Panda lawyers and look before we

go any further let me say this I like

wrestling and you might be surprised to

hear that but I don't you it's

objectively entertaining and the WWE has

over the years delivered numerous

ludicrous and genuinely incredible

moments from when jake the snake'

roberts set a live Cobra on Macho Man

Randy Savage did the time braun strowman

suplex the big show off the turnbuckle

and broke the entire ring to end Stone

Cold Steve Austin drove a beer truck

into the arena and sprayed the

corporation with a beer hose not to be

mistaken with it on that Kurt Angle

drove a milk truck into the arena and

sprayed Stone Cold Steve Austin with a

milk hose and then there was whatever

the this is

[Applause]

everything about that is fantastic but

my favorite part is after the table was

lit on fire the commentator asking

what's gonna happen what was he

expecting to happen Oh

the tables on fire oh my god here comes

a hibachi chef and he's making one of

those on the table it is were talking

about the WWE tonight for multiple

reasons first it's astonishingly popular

it has over a billion fans on social

media it has two highly rated cable

shows its own streaming network reality

shows video games and even a movie

studio which has produced such hits as

the Scorpion King walking tall the

Marine the Marine - the Marine 3 the

rooting for the marine 5 the marine 6

and of course Lincoln by the way by the

way their first choice to play Abraham

Lincoln was actually Brutus the barber

beefcake but he wasn't available so the

role went to Daniel day-lewis who was he

was he was fine I'm not this company

makes a lot of money last year it

generated a record 930 million in

revenue in fact WrestleMania alone which

is taking place next Sunday is one of

the most valuable sports brands in the

world ranking higher than the World

Series which actually makes sense when

you think about it because while the

World Series is mostly spent watching a

millionaire in a button-down think about

whether or not to throw a ball

WrestleMania involves things like this

[Applause]

are you not going to change how could

any other TV show top that in fact every

other show she just because

unfortunately not a guy exploding

through her table and this show should

very much be included in that but but

the other reason that it's worth talking

about the WWE's because of the

prevalence of stories like these Eddie

Guerrero found dead in a Minneapolis

hotel room the World Wrestling star was

just 38 years old we have just confirmed

that Randy Macho Man Savage has died

Chyna

one of the most famous wrestlers in the

90s has now died she was 46 years old

pro wrestling legend King Kong Bundy has

died at the age of 61 he came here we

were in studio a and he relayed me

almost up to the ceiling he'll be missed

just 61 years old these wrestlers died

in early wow that is a harrowing

statement there from Brian Kilmeade

only slightly dampened by his childlike

wonder and how high the big man lifted

him and how did that even happen did

Bundy offer him did kill me to ask

honestly I wouldn't really be surprised

if one of his stock interview questions

is up horsey rides but Kilmeade is not

actually wrong there because Redfoo

flying early is a troubling trend 538

tracked the rate of deaths among WWF

wrestlers and the findings were

startling

here is the expected death rate by age

group among the population as a whole

here is the rate among former NFL

players and here is the rate among

wrestlers that is shockingly high you'd

expect that line to be labeled test

pilots who lied on their resume or

zookeepers who aren't just gonna let

some baboon screen to them like

that

hey hey enough sass-mouth there buddy

put some respect on my name so so with

that in mind tonight

a week ahead of Wrestlemania let's take

a look at how the WWE does business and

how it treats its wrestlers and before

we start you can't talk about the WWE

without talking about its chairman and

CEO Vince McMahon because he's

incredibly powerful as you can see in

this actual photo he took for a fitness

magazine the magazine scary grandpa who

looks like a big bumpy hot dog Horton

Vince bought the company from his dad

and has since overseen its meteoric

ascent into the mainstream because

before he came along wrestling was

splintered into fiefdom around the

country all of which had their own

broadcasts welcome to this special

edition of world class Championship

Wrestling welcome this week's edition of

mid-south wrestling welcome to video

manic Championship Wrestling I get

wrestling is all about spectacle and

pageantry but a tuxedo gym a tuxedo tone

it down a notch you're not at a

gala

Michael as usual no notes you look great

to keep living your truth throughout the

80s and 90s Vince McMahon gradually

eliminated or absorbed his competitors

and now one giant company basically

holds a monopoly on the industry and

it's impossible to overstate just how

involved Vince is he's not just CEO he

obviously storylines scripts everything

even playing a fictionalized version of

himself as the show's over arching

villain although his choices of how to

dramatize that have been pretty

questionable whether it's him forcing

female wrestlers to strip or beating up

his supposed illegitimate son

Hornswoggle or dropping the ultimate

racial slur as part of a comedic skits

yeah what's good

that is rough to watch and remember he's

in complete control of those scripts no

one is making him do that and well yes

he is playing a villain there there are

many other ways that that can be

achieved Darth Vader was a great villain

not once did he drop the n-word

meanwhile r2 said it pretty much

non-stop it's why he kept getting bleep

but but but the fact that that man is an

active character in wrestling actually

gives us an opportunity because he's

taken a lot of in ring abuse over the

years so I point tonight where you're

gonna be disgusted with him for say

using the n-word I can now simply play a

clip like this of the rock smashing them

over the head with a trash can lid

[Applause]

wrestling's good it's just very good but

while the character Vince is an asshole

it's important to know that the real

Vince is also an asshole and many fans

legitimately hate him because well the

WWE has made him a billionaire many

wrestlers say he's treated them terribly

just listen to Bret hitman Hart weren't

one of the biggest wrestlers of all time

speaking about his former boss Vince

McMahon has always had this mentality

about treating wrestlers like circus

animals all these wrestlers that have

broke their backs making this living for

years end up with nothing when it's over

and then they sort of take you out back

and they put a slug in the back of head

and dump you out now that's the life of

a professional wrestler now that might

sound extreme to you but Hart has good

reason to be angry his own brother Owen

died wrestling for Vince and Hart is

frankly far from a lung in voicing

grievances about his former employer

because the shocking thing about McMahon

in his company is the extent to which he

shielded himself from responsibility for

his wrestlers welfare and the main way

that he's done this is actually pretty

simple because well you might reasonably

think that the wrestlers employed by him

are his employees they're actually not

that they're merely independent

contractors just as former wrestler

Jesse Ventura pointed out on Howard

Stern it's just insane power they self

employed when you're signed exclusively

right you can't work for nobody else a

monopoly yeah they tell you when and

where you'll work they tell you who you

work they can totally control your life

and you and yet anaconda and yet they

call you an independent contractor how

has the government allowed them to get

away with that for 35 to 40 years yeah

he's got a point there an independent

contractor is someone that you might

hire for a specific limited task like a

plumber or an accountant wrestlers

aren't either of those things apart from

this wrestling plumber and this

wrestling accountant but the vast

majority are totally different and as

independent contractors wrestlers are

exempt from most discrimination and

occupational safety laws they also don't

get paid annual leave pensions or health

insurance and I would argue that when

you look at the Department of Labor and

the IRS is specific criteria for

independent contractors it's a complete

joke to think that they apply to Vince's

wrestlers for instance the IRS states

that independent contractors should be

free to work when and for whom they

choose well

Vince's wrestlers sign exclusive

contracts so that's complete

the guidelines also say that someone's

probably not an independent contractor

if the success or continuation of a

business depends to an appreciable

degree on the services they provide now

I guess the question there is our

wrestlers essential to World Wrestling

Entertainment it's a good question I

mean it's not called world totally empty

ring entertainment so that might be a

clue in fact if I might quote the

company's own website WWE performers of

the company's greatest asset without our

performers WWE would not exist

and look maybe when wrestlers might work

years ago for multiple different

organizations it made sense to call them

contractors but now that WWE has a

chokehold on this industry it makes just

as much sense to call them that as it

does to call Jimmy Carter a

panty-dropping machine it's just

clearly not true anymore

look for what it's worth

back in 1986 Ventura actually tried to

unionize wrestlers which could have

dramatically improved their working

conditions but man stamped it out heart

and if that makes you want to see

someone stamp him out hard I actually

have some good news for you

[Applause]

wrestling is better than the things you

like and the lack the lack of a union to

advocate for wrestlers means that Vince

gets to call all the shots because while

literally every major sports league has

an offseason for athletes to recover the

WWE works its wrestlers year-round

multiple times a week both on TV and in

untelevised so-called house shows and

big stars may be able to command big

money for that but not every wrestler is

a big star and whenever we've gotten

glimpses of wrestlers contracts they

contain some astonishing clauses one

says if a wrestler is unable to wrestle

for as little as six weeks because of an

injury the company can terminate their

contract

well another releases the company from

all liability for damage resulting in

permanent injury or death even if caused

by its own negligence which is a crazy

thing for McMahon to put in a contract

and frankly enough to make you want to

see him be on the receiving end of his

own medical mishap still technically

more helpful than a visit from dr. oz

when you take all of this together with

wrestlers working as independent

contractors in a monopolized industry

largely free from meaningful oversight

and able to be fired at any time you

wind up with an environment with huge

potential for unsafe conduct before

Lance mcnaught died at 29 of heart

failure while struggling with addiction

to painkillers he spoke of the pressure

that he felt to work through injury

saying everybody knows that if you get

hurt you work through it because you'll

lose your spot and another top wrestler

CM Punk has questioned the advice that

he was given by a WWE doctor following

an incident in the ring I got hit with

something and it rung my bell

and I got a concussion but we were

leaving for Europe the next day so doc

was leaning on me going do you want me

to do you have a concussion or can you

go to Europe kind of thing and I was

just like you you pigs I'll go

to Europe whatever that's on me that's

my fault I'm dry heaving after every

match I'm either puking for real or I'm

just dry heaving because I don't have

anything in my stomach that's like oh

you're sick here's a z-pack they z-pak

me to death so much then too

whereas my pants on a Smackdown he

did he actually did that and we actually

found that episode of SmackDown

smackdown and out of common courtesy we

are not going to show it to you but this

is his face as it was happening Punk

even tweeting about it afterwards saying

just my britches on Smackdown

please retweet something good WWE then

made him take down even though it's

obviously the best tweet ever written

seriously you try and think of a better

suite right now have you got one does it

say mark britches please retweet

then it's not better is it stand down

look obviously gets much worse

thanking past wrestlers

themselves on live TV

because wrestlers bodies regularly get

smashed up and undergo general wear and

tear damage that's cumulative and can

last a lifetime but McMahon doesn't

provide health insurance for his

wrestlers for anything other than

injuries that occur inside the ring in

fact the extent to which he's denied any

responsibility for their welfare is

astonishing just watching respond to a

question years ago about wrestler deaths

do you have a reason why these people

would be dying under the age of 45 why

don't you ask yourself that question I

mean why why what are you indicating

that's my responsibility these people

are dead because asking you if it's in

any way shape or form falls on your

shoulders

I would accept no responsibility

whatsoever for their untimely deaths

none whatsoever

as far as and you've got that look on

your face like yeah well but none

whatsoever I mean they wrestled for you

it was the heart of your organization

they had worked a couple of hundred

nights a year for you they live this

lifestyle what are you doing

you weird weird man and while all of

that is ridiculous my favorite response

isn't actually the weird face or the

smacking of the papers it's answering

why our wrestlers dying early with why

don't you ask yourself that question

which in terms of dodges is certifiably

insane I don't know things maybe because

that journalist doesn't employ any

wrestlers I want to know that you don't

think you do either I'm telling you

you're wrong about that

now the company will say that they've

completely transformed in recent years

and they have taken some positive steps

like banning Church shots in their head

and introducing concussion protocols

although CM Punk's experience probably

suggests that there may be room for some

significant improvement there but but

some of the other steps they've taken

under their talent wellness program are

a little underwhelming like the fact

that they now have annual physical

examinations that's just nothing I have

to take one of those every year to host

this show and I've never once exploded

through this table it's in the name of

our show now the program also provides

for things like cardiovascular and brain

testing which is nice although remember

they're still responsible for their own

health insurance and while the company

says it pays for addiction treatment for

former wrestlers that doesn't really

address the underlying issues that get

them hooked on pain medication in the

first place and the tragic thing is some

have reluctantly had to drag their

bodies back to the WWE because they have

no other financial option rowdy roddy

piper continued wrestling into his 40s

and 50s and just listen to him explain

why wrestling is it has a tremendous

entrance plan you come in as boy here

you are you rock the wall and everything

is one it's got no exit plan and rowdy

roddy piper should know a few months ago

he climbed back into the ring what would

you have me do it 49 when like my

pension plan I can't take out till I'm

65 I'm not gonna make 65 let's just face

facts guys and sadly he was right about

that cuz Roddy Piper died in 2015 at the

age of 61 and while nothing I say can or

should make that okay I do hope they're

watching this final clip events in the

ring gives you just a tiny piece of

catharsis

[Applause]

you know the reassuring thing there is

you can fake being kicked in the face or

hit in the head with a bedpan but there

is no faking that so I guess the

question is is there any pulp here but

incredibly there might be because there

is one group that even McMahon

occasionally seems to listen to and

that's the fans they actually have a

strong independent voice in the WWE and

have been vocal over the years about

everything from the company's dealings

with Saudi Arabia to its treatment of

female wrestlers who have come a long

way from the old days of so-called bra

and panty matches in fact fans online

launched their hashtag give divas a

chance campaign at a feature women more

more prominently to which Vince himself

responded we hear you keep watching and

next week for the first time ever

Wrestlemania will be headlined by a

women's match so wrestling fans don't

just go along with whatever the company

tells them to cheer and boo they know

what they like and just as importantly

what they don't like

for instance the WWE tried for years

literally years to make Roman reigns a

superstar hero on the level of the rock

but fans just didn't like him and they

let him and the WWE know about that and

keep in mind as he watch this Roman

reigns is supposed to be a good guy

[Applause]

they boot him non-stop for eight minutes

and you might think that's harsh but I

know he was the only rational response

to someone with permanently wet hair how

could it always be wet you look like a

pedophile out for a jog boo boo so so

the fans have a big voice here that's

the point and they really care about

these wrestlers and continue to do that

long after the WWE has abandoned them

and nowhere was the extent of this

devotion more obvious than when

legendary wrestler jake the snake'

needed help paying for medical expenses

Jake had is no insurance he didn't have

any money to pay for the surgery so we

had to come up with some kind of

solution so we we put up a page on

IndieGoGo to try to raise the money for

a surgery I'm real but the really

cool thing that came out of that was

Jake got to see how much the fans really

cared all those years ago say I guess

they did leave something yeah

those years meant a lot of fans that's

why they want him and other wrestlers to

be taken care of they've actually been

multiple GoFundMe campaigns to cover

both healthcare and funeral expenses for

wrestlers that fans have stepped up for

which is heartwarming but frankly fans

shouldn't be the ones shouldering that

responsibility here's how bad it is even

the NFL for all its massive thoughts now

offers players health reimbursement

accounts and have established a legacy

fund for older players who may be

dealing with health issues and when

you've lost the moral high ground to the

NFL you are lauralee subterranea

the potential opportunities because

remember WrestleMania the biggest event

in the WWE's calendar is next Sunday any

fans in that arena

what McMahon to help pay for wrestlers

long term health care or just to call

them employees they could say choose to

make up a chance about that the event is

live

the crowd is miked they won't be able to

cut the chance out I'm not saying that

fans should do that or make signs or

make lots of signs I'm just saying I

really hope they make their voices heard

on this because given that business Hulk

here is a billionaire on the broken

backs of his non employees the very

least he can do is show the same

dedication to wrestlers that they have

shown to his company on I know that I

haven't really said any of this tonight

in the preferred language of wrestling

fans so maybe this will help

wrestling fans cheered Royal Rumble real

the Hell in a Cell

you killed your head off at SummerSlam

ready to scream for something new I'm

talking about Louds or favorite

wrestlers having access to retirement

care workers comp and family and

vertical

[Applause]

walking comfortably bending their knees

past a 90-degree angle a spending

quality time with their grandchildren

you can see all this is more the system

was put in place that gave wrestlers

things like an offseason because the

human body was not designed to do things

like this 200 nights a year we're

talking about bringing three mature

wrestlers they're back in line with

actuarial tables he's gonna need a

doctor

they preferably one who won't make it

advance on Smackdown

before it is at WrestleMania 35 why not

join thousands of screaming fans and

calling for your favorite wrestlers to

be employee though you never have to pay

for their future surgery drew go mr.

McMahon doesn't like it you know what he

can do

[Applause]

the decision

[Applause]

as this is our final episode of the year

we wanted to thank you so much for

watching we had a lot of fun despite you

know the world we've started a crisis

pregnancy center we had Wilmer

Valderrama in a bird suit we wrote a

book about Mike Prince's rabbit and you

bought it we built it a lot

raising a huge amount of money for The

Trevor Project and 80 90 thank you so

much for doing that season they've got

HBO's web site temporarily blocked in

China whoops

we talked to Anita Hill about her

experiences and they depressingly

prescient interview we put Gritty on our

dog Supreme Court but a quick update

about my personal favorite moment from

this year because by now you probably

know that we sometimes like to buy

stupid things um for instance last year

we bought five wax presidents at Carter

Nixon Harding Clinton and Harrison and

we made a movie about the life of warren

g harding with Laura Linney we actually

promised you that we would try and find

a way to use the rest of the presidents

but we never probably got around to it

well this year we bought something even

dumber because when Russell Crowe held

his divorce auction we bought a bunch of

his memorabilia including his jockstrap

from the 2005 film Cinderella Man which

we then donated to one of the last

blockbusters in Alaska and to his

immense credit Russell Crowe used the

money that we paid to fund the John

Oliver koala chlamydia Awards at the

Australia Zoo which is that is a burn so

hard that only koalas with chlamydia can

sympathize

it was a truly life-affirming sequence

of events although I'm sorry to say that

I do have a sad update on the Alaskan

blockbuster part of that story alaska's

last two blockbuster video stores are

calling it quits Jon Oliver tried to

draw a little attention to these stores

to save them he gave them a leather jock

strap that Russell Crowe wore the movie

Cinderella Man would call attention to

sure incredibly that did not have first

you just a little bit but you know

it is very sad although I will be honest

I didn't really expect the jock strap to

save blockbuster completely as amazing

as Russell Crowe's led the scrotum

holster is I didn't really think it had

the power to make Netflix disappear now

if you are wondering what happened to

all of Russell Crowe's merchandise I

have good news and bad news the good

news is there's actually one remaining

blockbuster in America it's in Oregon

and all the items were sent there the

bad news is one of them went missing and

tragically it was the jock strap though

there were actually numerous stories

about its disappearance and and I am

sorry to tell you that we have no idea

where Russell Crowe's jockstrap is we

don't we simply don't except for the

fact that we actually do in fact not

only do we know where that jockstrap is

we asked ourselves what would be the

single dumbest possible way to pay

tribute to the most wonderfully stupid

thing that happened this year and the

answer we hope you will agree was this

all right listen up we've robbed banks

museums casinos this this is the big one

greatest heist of all time we're gonna

steal Russell Crowe's jock strap from

the 2005 film Cinderella man

[Music]

[Applause]

[Applause]

this won't be easy that's why I've hired

the best of the best

tricky dick the best damn explosives man

in New York City

Jimmy see no bees mr. Fixit himself has

no ride he can't chop

Willie pneumonia sick man with a sick

rap sheet

Billy wheels the man with the master

[Music]

actually I'm not really sure what he

does and of course our ringleader the og

himself

g-dog like I said this won't be easy it

could get messy they're gonna throw

everything they got at us

you ready to do this buckle up



these guys are everywhere cover me

the hell that come from

[Applause]

that's how it's done

[Music]

security breach you think this is over

we have the stroke

don't you let that jockstrap get away G

dog

stay on them stay on them

[Applause]

[Music]

what the hell do these guys work for

although my pretty I've missed you

[Applause]

churches America's favorite place for

redemption and six favorite place for

chicken churches are a cornerstone of

American life there are roughly 350

thousand congregations in the United

States and many of them do great work

feeding the hungry clothing the poor but

this is not a story about them this is

about the churches who exploit people's

faith for monetary gain and when I say

that you probably think of 1980s

televangelists like this guy I'm just

getting into a prophetic vein mamama

cause so long about satire man dr. King

giving the devil someone with a nice

digestive tract problems quickly called

man that Cassata we've seen midgets grow

we've seen arms and legs that start

going because the grow cells that stop

man that about sot i don't make this

stuff up please please you can't say I

don't make this stuff up just five

seconds after you said the words manda

cassava Sangha that man is Robert Tilton

and though he like many televangelist

was caught up in an exposé a decades ago

he never really went away healing going

to those knees arthritis door in the

name of Jesus tumors go in the name of

Jesus that one calling with lupus lupus

you foul devil you bow to the name of

Jesus lupus you bow to the name of Jesus

you go up in Jesus name lupus you

complicated and not especially easy to

describe malady you go lupus you vex us

with your foul lupus nurse you go now

though you may not be aware of it

televangelism is still thriving in this

country and Robert Tilton is just a very

small part of it there are several large

media networks devoted to televangelism

including Trinity inspiration ministries

and Daystar and the preachers that

appear on them can have incredible

lifestyles just earlier this year a man

named creflo dollar got people's

attention with a bold request pastor

Creflo Dollar of the world changers

church international facing harsh

criticism after starting a fundraising

campaign to buy this 65 million dollar

luxury private jet

you cannot stop me from dreaming it's

not how you ask for 65 million dollars

it's what you scream at your father when

he tells you you'll never be a Broadway

dancer I can do it dad I've got the

music hit me but but here's the thing

creflo dollar wanting a private jet is

not remotely unusual there is a pattern

of preachers wanting high-end airplanes

and when they get them they're not

always particularly humble about it I

had enough money to buy a beautiful

sister citationjet cash and since

there's so much jealousy in this room

tonight that I can feel over this a few

weeks later I bought another one worth

three times what that one was

cash act happy over my blessing folks I

bought a jet cash I bought a bigger jet

cash the haters act happy for me that's

that's not a sermon it's the first draft

of a Rick Ross single now now creatures

claim these planes are vital tools look

at Kenneth Copeland who along with his

wife Gloria are among the most

successful TV evangelists a few years

back he asked his followers to help buy

a 20 million dollar jet promising it

would only be used for church business

but a local news crew did some digging

and what they found will probably not

surprise you it was a news 8

investigation last February which first

raised questions about Copeland's

apparently personal use of his new

church jack this is a preaching machine

most notably for a ski trip to Colorado

and visits to an exotic game ranch in

South Texas

here's Copeland and his son John proudly

posing with a pair of axis dear

indigenous to India and Sri Lanka holy

this guy's like a psychotic reverse

Noah two by two male and female came to

Kenneth Copeland and he just shot them

right between the king eyes

now Copeland's ministry will tell you

that he reimburses the church for trips

like that but that still means he has

private jets reimbursement money and yet

despite that personal wealth people

still send Kenneth Copeland creflo

dollar and that asshole with two planes

lots and lots of money and that's partly

because they preach something called the

prosperity gospel which argues that

wealth is a sign of God's favor and

donations will result in wealth coming

back to you that idea sometimes takes

the form of seed faith the notion that

donations are seeds that you will one

day get to harvest let me show you that

in action the size of your seed will

determine the size of your harvest I

don't understand why but there's

something happens at a level where

people step into faith and give a

thousand dollars that don't happen at

other levels you're going to have a

breakthrough through this two hundred

and seventy three dollar seed all you've

got is a thousand dollars listen that's

not enough money anyway to buy the house

you're trying to give him the apartment

you just want to buy the house that's

not enough money anyway you get to that

phone and you put that seed in the

ground and watch God work it out the

argument is so your money in the ground

and you will reap returns multiple times

over except as an investment you'd be

better off burying your money in the

actual ground because that leaves that

way there is a chance your dog may dig

it up and give it back to you one day

good boy but but it can get even more

predatory because if say you don't have

a thousand dollars or perhaps have

significant credit card debts seed faith

can still work for you I have a feeling

that somebody there wants a credit card

debt wiped out that if you'll use your

faith as you so as you sold a thousand

on a credit card as you use your faith

as you use your faith God's gonna wipe

out your credit card indebtedness think

about that that is the equivalent of

saying the key to you losing weight loss

at the bottom of this giant Costco bulk

bag of peanut butter M&Ms go find it

it's definitely down there this would be

amazing if the targets of these messages

were not often vulnerable people like

Bonnie Parker she did not seek medical

treatment for cancer instead choosing to

so money into Kenneth Copeland's church

and I'll let her daughter pick it up

from there I started funding notebooks

along her she passed away she believed

and I know she believes because it's in

the network's they've she sowed enough

seen which was money the the greater

amount of seed that you sow according to

them the better chance you have the

better chance you have of getting healed

at this point I think it's clear that

seed faith is the most disgusting seed

based concept since whatever the chia

seed pudding is Bonnie Parker gave

thousands of dollars to the coconut

church because she believed it was her

best chance of beating cancer and you

might think well that's crazy but it's

not an unreasonable interpretation of

the Copeland's preachings Gloria

Copeland sells numerous products on

healing through faith and has been

skeptical in the past about going to the

doctor we know what's wrong with you

you've got cancer the bad news is we

don't know what to do about it except

give you some poison that will make you

sicker now which do you want to do you

want to do that or you want to sit here

on Saturday morning hear the word of God

let faith come into your heart and be

it's pretty clear that woman cannot hear

the word of course because if she could

I'm pretty sure he'd be shouting warrior

is everything you've seen so far legal

but the money people donate in response

to it is tax-free because if you're

registered as a religious nonprofit or

especially a church you are given broad

exemptions over taxation and regulation

the IRS in fact produced a scintillating

video instructing its agents how to

treat churches and it contains a phrase

that you would not normally associate

with the agency hello and welcome to

churches and religious organizations

do's and don'ts four reasons as old as

the United States the tax laws and

regulations that govern churches and

religious organizations are purposely

broad and sometimes a little vague a

little vague oh they are under selling

that's because the films of Christopher

Nolan are a little vague a text from

your mom reading please call not

emergency but please call very important

don't worry that's a little vague the

IRS regulations are close to meaningless

according to their tax codes not only is

the term Church not specifically defined

they make no attempts to evaluate

whether the content of a doctrine is

religious provided the beliefs are truly

held and are not illegal but truly held

beliefs that are not illegal is almost

every belief bros before hos that could

be a religion red vines are better than

Twizzlers that could be a religion if

you believe the best movie ever made is

lady in the water then your name is M

night Shyamalan but congratulations mr.

Shyamalan that belief could be a

religion and being designated a church

confers all sorts of benefits like the

parsonage allowance which allows the

Copeland's to live in a 6.3 million

dollar house tax-exempt this is their

house that is a parsonage which only

makes sense if by parsonage they mean

house that looks like it cost the net

worth of Big Bang Theory's Jim Parsons

we actually asked the IRS how many

churches they've audited in recent years

and they did one in 2014 and just two in

2013 the odds of a church getting

audited are basically the same as Gloria

Copeland curing your cancer and

where you can operate little thing when

you can operate with so little oversight

it is amazing what you are able to do

look at Robert Tilton if you ever send

him a donation you cannot imagine what

happens and luckily you don't have to

imagine because and we should probably

come clean here we have been involved in

a correspondence with Robert Tilton

Church for the last seven months to try

and find out what he tells people so

settle in because this gets incredible

back in January I sent him $20 and a

letter asking to be added to his mailing

list within two weeks he sent me a

letter back thanking me for my donation

and claiming I believe that God has

supernaturally brought us together and

supernatural is a bit of a stretch I saw

him on television and I sent him some

money he wasn't my dead lover who came

back to help me with some pottery but

soon afterwards he sent me a second

letter and inside there was a one dollar

bill which was exciting until I saw the

inscription instructing me to send it

back to him with your best proof God

tithes or offering that's right I had to

send the one dollar back with an

additional recommended offering of $37

which I did so at this point were just

two letters in and already it's like

having a pen pal who's in deep with some

loan sharks this correspondence

continued back and forth like this until

March when he sent me three small

packets of colored oil that I was

instructed to pour on letters and send

back to him by specific dates along with

more money so I did that and in April I

got a letter in a manila envelope with a

message cheque enclosed and I thought

fantastic I've seeded and I've seeded

and have seeded here comes my harvest

then I open it and this is true it was a

check for five dollars from me made out

to pasture till his shirt

this went on for seven more letters and

then he sent me a piece of fabric in the

shape of some mountains I assumed at

this point I'd somehow reach to the

mountain level and surprise surprise he

asked me to send those mountains back to

him with some more money again so I did

and then he sent me another letter with

another single dollar bill inside he

told me to put that dollar bill in my

Bible for one night and then send it

back the next day with 49 more dollars

so that he can have it blessed with oil

and send me a one dollar bill back that

has been blessed adding I must warn you

not to rob God with your tithes and

offerings and then for emphasis

I can't urge you enough do not let this

one dollar bill stay in your house and

you know what I kept that one dollar

bill because that did not stop him the

letters kept on coming I received

another oil package more prayer cloths

and even and this is true an outline of

his foot which I was asked to trace my

foot on and mail back to him with more

money so as of tonight

I have sent him three hundred and

nineteen dollars and received 26 letters

that's almost one a week and again this

is all hilarious until you imagine these

letters being sent to someone who cannot

afford what he's asking for so at this

point I was getting pretty angry and

looking for a sign of what to do so I

watched a little more Robert Tilton and

the most amazing thing happened there's

a person watching me and you am very

frustrated with your purpose in life

that might be me Bob because I'm

extremely frustrated right now as it

seems my purpose in the last seven

months has been to send you money

through the mail

so so I will ask what's that message

that you have for me that's so strong

just then just then I had a word of

knowledge for someone that's really been

seeking God you have for a particular

purpose or a decision in your life and

that is when I realized the message

Robert Tilton was sending me was that I

should set up my own church to test the

legal and financial limits of what

religious entities that is what we have

done we filed paperwork last week

establishing a church called Our Lady of

Perpetual exemption and it was

disturbingly easy to make sure we did

this correctly we had this actual tax

lawyer walk us through the process now

while the IRS does not have a definition

of a church they do have a 14-point test

as a guideline for churches but not only

do you not have to meet all 14 points

we'd already met some of them by

accident

for instance you need an established

place of worship but we meet every

Sunday in this studio in New York that

genuinely counts our lawyer also advises

our church needed to be a distinct legal

entity so we've registered our church as

a nonprofit corporation in Texas a

state's I do not live in have never

lived in but which is somehow completely

fine for us to incorporate a church in

now the IRS is guidelines suggest you

need a creed and form of worship but

I'll always suggest if we could fulfill

the worship requirements by merely

leading everyone in some specific ritual

such as having congregants silently

meditate on the nature of fraudulent

churches so

let us do exactly that and bow our heads

in silent contemplation and lo another

box was ticked finally according to our

attorney the best case for church

membership will be made by those

individuals who are actually present in

the live studio audience who will

profess belief in the church's Creed so

what do you say live studio audience

do you profess your belief go to church

[Music]

we get not truly we have witnessed a

miracle tonight

you

the Republican National Convention in

Cleveland the most apocalyptic thing

ever to happen to that city and bear in

mind their River has repeatedly caught

fire now it has been over for a few days

but we thought it might be worth taking

a few extra minutes to try and figure

out what the just happened because

you know you are dealing with a pretty

unconventional convention when a speaker

opens with this statement my name is

Dina white I am the president of the

Ultimate Fighting Championship the only

way that would have made sense is if his

next words were and I have clearly

sleepwalked here please gently walk me

from the stage and return me to my

family they are very worried now he was

actually there to speak to Donald

Trump's business acumen a repeated theme

throughout the whole week he gets stuff

done Donald Trump is a proven leader

innovator entrepreneur when Donald Trump

is in charge all that counts is ability

effort and excellence he has created

jobs for thousands and is one of the

greatest visionaries of our time now now

before you laughs you cannot say Trump

isn't a visionary for a long time he was

the only one who envisioned himself as a

presidential nominee he is basically

what happens if the secret gets into the

wrong hands but that message of Trump as

a skilled manager was somewhat undercut

by the fact the entire convention was a

mismanaged show from Melania Trump

using a partly plagiarized speech to Ted

Cruz being booed off the stage for not

endorsing Donald Trump to the fact that

supposedly Donald Trump knew Ted Cruz

wouldn't endorse him and didn't care the

decision came as no surprise to Trump

who tweeted I saw his speech two hours

early but let him speak anyway nobody

deal yeah but that's not reassuring if

the captain of the Titanic who tweeted

after the fact I saw that iceberg two

hours before and sailed into it anyway

no big deal

you wouldn't think well that captain's

sure ran a tight ship we are it's

actually fitting that Trump had

seemingly done so little to prepare for

his party's convention giving that the

party itself had done so little to

prepare for Donald Trump after the last

election the GOP published a post-mortem

report titled the growth and opportunity

project analyzing their mistakes and

laying out a plan to expand their appeal

now it featured passages like many

minorities wrongly think that

Republicans do not like them or want

them in the country and we must

emphasize the importance of a welcoming

inclusive message in particular when

discussing issues that relate directly

to a minority group unfortunately over

the past year that report and it's

carefully considered suggestions has

been overshadows by a different report

titled literally everything Donald Trump

has ever said and done because this is a

guy who suggested building a wall to

keep Mexicans out and advocated a

temporary ban on Muslims entering the

country so it's like making a new year's

resolution to eat healthy and then

spending the next year only eating meals

so large that they're free if you eat

them in one sitting but amazingly

through all the chaos and confusion this

week one theme did emerge and it was

accidentally summarized best and I can't

believe I'm saying this but Antonio

sabato jr. an IMDB page awarded actor

who delivered a relatively restrained

speech before opening his hearts

regarding President Obama to ABC News

first of all I don't believe that the

guy is a Christian I don't believe you

follows the guy that I love and the

Jesus that I love usually my President

Obama is a Muslim option is that what

you're saying absolutely and that is

based on what you feel in your art

that's what I believe yeah you know what

I have the right to believe that and you

have the right to go against that but I

believe it

now what revealing there isn't he's

mistaken belief that President Obama is

a Muslim it's also not the big shot that

Antonio sabato jr. star of the actual

vh1 reality show

Mayan

tonio is still both alive and an idiot

know what is truly revealing is his

implication that believing something to

be true is the same as it being true

because if anything that was the theme

of the Republican convention this week

it was a four day exercise in

emphasizing feelings over facts people

around the country feel the Obama

administration is kick them to the curb

our country right now is now in a very

bad spot you can feel it the vast

majority of Americans today do not feel

safe there's a lot of Americans out

there who feel like Democrat politicians

have taken them for granted the whole

economy feels stuck what do you mean it

feels stuck the economy is about numbers

feelings are supposed to be irrelevant

incidentally feelings are supposed to be

irrelevant is a phrase that's inscribed

on every British marriage certificate

and this focus this focus on feelings

reached its apex in Donald Trump's

acceptance speech which was light on

concrete policy but heavy on provoking

strong emotions decades of progress made

in bringing down crime are now being

reversed I know that corruption has

reached a level like never ever before

in our country poverty and violence at

home war and destruction abroad 180,000

illegal immigrants with criminal records

order deported from our country are

tonight roaming free to threaten

peaceful citizens holy he sounds

like he's about to announce the first

annual Hunger Games but look it is worth

noting that since President Obama took

office crime rates the flow of illegal

immigrants over our borders and claims

for unemployment benefits have all

declined and get frightening Lee when

reporters started pointing that out it

didn't seem to matter just watch as Newt

Gingrich brushed off any effort to

fact-check Trump's claims about the u.s.

crime rate violent crime is down the

economy is down it is not down in the

big

city's violent crime murder rate is down

how comes then how come it's up in

Chicago up in Baltimore there are

pockets where certain certainly we are

not time capital your third or third

biggest city violent crime across the

country is down the average American I

will bet you this morning does not think

crime is down does not think they are

safer but it is we are safer and it is

done no that's your view I just don't

know either I should but what I should

know what I said also effect no it isn't

no it isn't it's only a fact that that's

a feeling people have this is a graph of

the violent crime rate it's not asking

Rorschach test because infer anything

you like from it and sure you can

cherry-pick

recent optics in some cities but the

overall trend across the country during

the Obama presidency and indeed for the

last 25 years is down but Newt wasn't

done the current view is that liberals

have a whole set of statistics which

theoretically may be right but it's not

we're human beings it but what you're

saying it but hold on but Mr Speaker

because you're saying liberals use these

numbers they use this sort of magic map

this is the FBI statistics they're not a

liberal organization they're but what I

showed is equally true people feel it

more threat they feel it but the facts

don't support it as a political

candidate I'll go with how people feel

and I'll let you go with the

theoreticians he brought he just brought

a feeling to a f--king fact fight and it

is worth taking um just a moment to

seriously consider what Gingrich was

saying there because think about it I

think we can all agree that candidates

can create feelings in people and what

Gingrich is saying is that feelings are

as valid as facts so then by the

transitive property candidates can

create facts which is terrifying because

that means someone like Donald Trump can

essentially create his own reality and

that is the closest thing to an actual

magic spell I think I've ever seen

and if you're thinking we'll hold on

eventually reality will set in because

if elected Trump would actually have to

deal with facts but I'm not so sure

about that

just this week The Times reported that

not only was John Kasich asked if he had

any interest in the vice presidency by

the Trump campaign he was offered quite

a lot more Donald Trump jr. even called

one of john Kasich's top aides and said

that if he wanted the job he could even

be in charge of foreign and domestic

policy which of course is kind of

everything yeah exactly

the only thing that is not foreign

policy or domestic policy is space

policy which leads me to believe Donald

Trump's entire goal is to eventually own

the moon but but it gets better because

apparently when k-6 advisors asked what

Trump would be in charge of the response

was making America great again which

objectively is not a job but I guess it

feels like one and it seems that's all

the King matters now now the Trump

family disputed that story naturally but

it does often seem like Trump is more

interested in attention than the hard

work of getting things done in a

complicated political system just last

night he tweeted out what seemed to be

his main takeaway from this convention

okay okay first 24 out of 75 is 32% not

33 but that doesn't matter that clearly

doesn't matter the point is look the

point the notion that Donald Trump would

be a hands-off president might actually

represent the best-case scenario here

the much more frightening prospect would

be if he were hangs on because between

those 24 minutes of applause was a

symphony of bile and race-baiting

remember this is the man who has

retaliated against journalists and at

various points has advocated killing

terrorists families endorse torture and

expressed admiration for leaders like

Kim jong-un Saddam Hussein and Vladimir

Putin his message this week was the

message of every strong man ever the

world is dangerous and only I can make

you safe and if that sounds scary

there have been warning signs just watch

this DVD extra from the first season of

The Apprentice it's a it's a music video

they made and it gives you a sense of

how Donald Trump envisions himself this

is a dictatorship and I'm depicted

no boating's there's no jury oh sure hey

it's funny now to hear him say he's a

dictator as a voice in the background

says slave to the master over and over

again but unless we're careful by this

time next year that could be America's

new national anthem

you

Mike Pence vice-president the United

State and whatever the exact opposite of

a Silver Fox is I'm gonna go with action

weasel and if you're wondering why talk

about pence well with all the recent

focus on who Trump is firing in the

White House it is worth remembering the

one person that that cannot actually

happen to president Trump cannot but see

mr. pence as the indispensable man in

his inner circle he is brett by statute

the one person in the West Wing to whom

Donald Trump cannot say you're fired

that is true now while in many ways

pence is like any other Trump employee

ethically compromised creeps the

out by Jared and subjected to all sorts

of unwanted physical contact hence is

constitutionally the only official in

the White House that Trump can't fire

and that is worrisome because he is

synonymous with some extreme positions

like his opposition to abortion and gay

rights just listen to our osa who

remember had first-hand experience

working with him we would be begging for

days of Trump back if pence became

president that's all of this game he's

extreme I'm Christian I love Jesus

but he thinks Jesus tells him to say

thanks

Jesus I say that she's right Omarosa is

right there also I'm pretty sure the

original titles of the new and Old

Testaments were Jesus said this and

Jesus I say that so

so if Pence is that terrifying tonight

let's take a look at him and and if

there are any Mike Pence supporters

watching this I cannot promise that he

is going to come out of tonight's show

looking great but I can promise that I

will say something nice about him before

this piece is over you have my word on

that

so let's begin Pence's reputation is as

the old boring principal to contrast to

Donald Trump but the truth is he's been

more than willing to defend the

indefensible and while all politicians

equivocate Pence is exceptionally good

at dodging tough questions just look at

this interview from just after Trump

tweeted entirely falsely that he had won

the popular vote if you just deducted

the millions of people who voted

illegally watch how many times pence

refuses to engage in the premise of the

question that statement is false why is

it responsible to make it well I think I

think the president-elect just wants a

call to call to attention the fact that

that there has been evidence over over

many years of fraud and and and

expressing that reality the Pew Research

Center found evidence of that four years

ago as certainly certainly his right but

you know it's his right to make false

statements well it's it's his right to

express his opinion as a president-elect

to the United States I think one of the

things that's refreshing about our

president-elect and the it's one of the

reasons why I think he made such an

incredible connection with people all

across this country is because he he

tells you what's on his mind but why

make false statements well look I don't

know that that is a false statement

George and neither do you but yes you do

though because everyone knows that

statement was which is why it's

a little alarming that pence would be so

willing to defend a complete lie by

calling it refreshing because if that's

the standard you can say all sorts of

things in the names of refreshment you

could say Mike Pence spent four hundred

thousand dollars having his penis

replaced with a marshmallow peep is that

true who knows but try telling me you're

not refreshed hearing about it

but despite lies like that pence is

well-liked among evangelical voters

eight out of ten of whom voted for the

Trump pence ticket and he does have

impeccable credentials as a social

conservative pence used to have a local

radio show the Mike Pence show in the

90s where he sounded off on hot-button

issues and while current pence is

controlled and polished back then he was

surprisingly animated just listen to him

address one day's topic with some real

contempt in his voice early in the week

we talked about whether or not it was

time to rethink this whole business of

women in the military what the is

that toe he's saying women in the

military with the same perm you skeptics

as we used to describe this whole

business of dinosaurs in medical school

or chair in the starting lineup for the

Cleveland Cavaliers she's a bench player

at best you restrict her minutes we all

know that look

he wasn't just being provocative there

he means it two years later pence wrote

an editorial attacking the Disney film

Mulan for showing a woman in combat

concluding women in military bad idea

and if you're thinking well well come on

he grew up in the 1950s it's just a

generational thing no he didn't he's 58

years old Pence is three months younger

than flavor flake who has no

excuse there

and that was just one of many ludicrous

opinions that pentas expressed over the

years he also argued for the teaching of

intelligent design in schools he

expressed they hoped to consign Roe

versus Wade to the ash heap of history

and as governor of Indiana responded to

an HIV outbreak among drug users by

dragging his feet on allowing needle

exchange programs during which time he

said he was going to go home and pray on

it which and I realize this isn't

necessarily the most relevant criticism

here but can't you do that from the

office but perhaps the issue Pence is

most associated with is his hostility to

LGBT rights and it is not just me saying

that his boss seems to think so too

The New Yorker setting a campaign

staffer reports that behind closed doors

Trump had a habit of mocking Vice

President Mike Pence's religiosity when

the conversation turned to gay rights

Trump motion towards pence and joked

don't ask that guy you want to hang them

all look look Trump is clearly joking

about that but it is also the kind of

punch line that only works if we all

know the premise behind it to be true

like jokes about terrible airline food

or bad breakups or how people from

Toronto a terrified of hard boiled eggs

their jokes based on universal knowledge

we all agree on and the truth is pence

is not and has never been a friend of

the gay community over the years he

sport anti-discrimination laws that

would have protected them

he's also opposed allowing gays to serve

in the military openly or otherwise with

his campaigns website saying

homosexuality is incompatible with

military service and he wants defended

the sanctity of marriage in another

surprisingly passionate speech marriage

was ordained by God instituted in the

law is the glue of the American family

and the safest harbor to raise children

and it must be defended against the

onslaught of the left in the Congress in

the courts and if need be in the

Constitution of the United States of

America

holy if if if I may quote one of

America's greatest philosophers when

pence made national news by signing a

controversial Religious Freedom

Restoration Act which many felt enable

businesses to discriminate on the basis

of sexuality and realloc Xander and her

wife Cynthia believe it's an invitation

to discriminate by refusing service you

know we don't know what restaurants or

what stores we can go into and you know

not be turned away and have to suffer

you know that's degrading it's

embarrassing exactly people were afraid

of being turned away from restaurants

and it is bad enough for someone to

privately dislike you for your sexuality

but it's even worse to be publicly told

that you are too gay for waffles and and

yet and yet when this possibility was

raised to pence by his arch nemesis

George Stephanopoulos he refused to even

engage in the question so yes or no if a

florist in Indiana refuses to serve a

gay couple at their wedding is that

legal now in Indiana George this is this

is where this debate has gone with with

misinformation and it's just a question

sir yes well well this there's been

shameless rhetoric about my state and

about this law and about its intention

all over the Internet do you think it

should be legal in the state of Indiana

to discriminate against gays or lesbians

George it's a yes or no question come on

Hoosiers don't believe in discrimination

that's neither the word yes

nor the word no it's the word Hoosier

which isn't an answer to any question

besides what's a good derogatory slang

term for an owl with a drinking problem

look at yourself you're Hoosier you're

gonna go fly into a tree get

your life together

Hoosier but while Hoosiers may

not believe in discrimination Mike Pence

clearly does and yet interestingly one

specific allegation he's pushed back on

concerns whether or not he supported gay

conversion therapy a question the

frankly didn't come out of nowhere when

Mike Pence ran for Congress in Indiana

in the 1990s his campaign agenda

included this resources should be

directed toward those institutions which

provide assistance to those seeking to

change their sexual behavior according

to the vice president spokesperson mr.

pence did not and does not support gay

conversion therapy okay

well I personally find that denial

complete horseshit I will acknowledge

that the language on his website was

very carefully worded it does give him

an escape and his denial is the grossest

effort I've seen to reverse a decision

made in the early orts apart from

Russell Crowe's actual upcoming divorce

auction to settle his 2003 marriage it

is called Russell Crowe the art of

divorce it's real and it's amazing and

you can buy items such as this leather

jock strap used during the filming of

Cinderella Man will we be stupid enough

to bid on that I don't know why don't

you ask one of our five wax presidents

the point here is that's not the point

the point here is pence denies

supporting conversion therapy but that's

a little hard to take considering how

much he is praised someone closely

associated with it because one of his

mentor's is the notorious homophobe

James Dobson and if you are not familiar

with him I'll let him introduce himself

in a truly unsettling way I represent an

organization called

focus on a family which a three year old

one time called pocus and the fanny you

know that's not far off from what we're

trying to do in some ways I guess you

could say we're thrusting ourselves into

the whole of American spiritual life and

reaching around to grab the temples of

secular decadence because that's what

Focus on the Family is all about having

gay sex that's right reducing the rate

of gay sex by at least half the the

organization the Dobson founded Focus on

the Family has a history of promoting

conversion therapy for a decade if

sponsored a conference addressing

understanding and preventing

homosexuality called love one out which

could not sound any more like a

euphemism for masturbating as in all

this talk of being poked in the fanny

really makes me want to go and love one

out Dobson Dobson also wrote a book

titled marriage under fire in which he

stated Focus on the Family promotes the

truth that homosexuality is preventable

and treatable and he produced a video

series in which he elaborated on that

theme we want to talk about the

prevention and treatment of

homosexuality in boys they're more than

a thousand who are being treated at any

given time for homosexuality they don't

all change it's not easy to change I

don't want to imply that it's just a

simple thing you just decide you're not

gonna be homosexual anymore no there are

deeply rooted factors that account for

this and they are tough to whip now

obviously there is no such thing as the

homosexual agenda but if there were

whipping bad boys by the thousands

wouldn't not be on it now now Dobson

left Focus on the Family in

2010 and they have since claimed that

they have softened their message but if

you go to their website right now you

will find articles like when a loved one

says I'm gay the stages of grief and why

we support sexual orientation change

efforts not to mention the fact that

their logo still features a child who

dismembered to her parents and is

holding their severed arms aloft in some

sort of gruesome impish victory dance

and I think that's just sick so while

pants may claim that he did not and does

not support gay conversion therapy he

very much supports those who support his

because just last year as vice president

he was in Colorado saying this it is

great to be here on the 40th anniversary

of Focus on the Family allow me to

acknowledge the founder of this ministry

a man who became the author of an

enormous body of work that has inspired

millions and he's been a friend and a

mentor to me dr. James Dobson look

saying you don't support conversion

therapy and then calling Dobson your

mentor is like saying you're a staunch

vegetarian and a law abiding citizen and

by the way please meet my lifelong

friend and mentor the Hamburglar

and pence is not saying that as a city

radio host or an Indiana congressman he

say it as vice president of the United

States in which role he also presented

Dobson with an award just last June and

that is appalling and all this makes it

even more galling that at the start of

this piece I promised that I would

mention one thing that I liked about

pence and look a promise is a promise so

through gritted teeth here it is I kind

of like his rabbit I really genuinely do

and also I'm not the only one the vice

president and his wife could kiss their

audiences attention goodbye once Marlin

bundo was introduced that's right the

pen C's have a pet rabbit and his name

is Marlon Banda which again it kills me

to say this is an objectively good name

for a bunny

and Marlin boldo is a great rabbit he

has his own Instagram account here is

making an important phone call here he

is making another one this time using a

landline and here he's posing next to a

strangely appropriate sign that says if

you met my family you would understand

here's the thing Garland I haven't yet I

still do

the point is Marlin fondo is the most

likable thing about an otherwise

unlikable man look how George W Bush is

a perfectly fine painter or how Bill

Cosby raised awareness Americans

awareness of pudding or how Roger Ailes

is dead sometimes we can't deny but

there's one thing you like about someone

and bondo is actually about to get even

more attention the first tell-all book

to come out of the current White House

is hopping into bookstores Marlin bundo

the pet rapid a vice president Mike

Pence there he's signing a deal to

publish Marlin bundles a day in the life

of the vice president that is true

Marlin bando has a children's book

coming out this is it it's being

released tomorrow there's even going to

be a book tour and I would love to say

fine look it's a fun sweet book about a

rabbit who gives a but

unfortunately one of the stops on that

book tour is a focus on the

family

so congratulations pence you even

managed to ruin marlin bond oh now none

of us can enjoy a book about your rabbit

or can we because it turns out in a

complete coincidence we also wrote a

book about Mike Pence's rabbit that has

also been published in fact while he's

out tomorrow

right now now there are a few small

differences between the two books you'll

notice right away that our rabbit has a

bowtie so there's that also our story is

about Marlon bunt Oh falling in love

with another boy rabbits because our

Marlin Bonzo is gay the point is you can

actually bite this book starting right

now at Amazon and at better Bongo book

calm which should be easy enough to

remember if you want the regular Bongo

book with a better bundle book it's a

better bond o book calm all of our

proceeds from dicks are going to The

Trevor Project which provides crisis

intervention services for LGBTQ youth

and aged 90 which works to end the AIDS

epidemic in the United States for those

are two great reasons to buy this book

another is that selling more books than

pence

will probably really piss him off so

that's three great reasons right there

you can also buy an audiobook at

audible.com featuring Jim Parsons Jesse

Tyler Ferguson

Jeff Garlin Ellie Kemper John Lithgow

Jack McBrayer and RuPaul and let me be

completely clear about this this is

actual book for children this is a real

children's book this isn't some adult

book telling Mike Pence to go

himself although in buying it that's

exactly what you would be doing

is a sweet story about Marlon bundle

falling in love and to prove it here is

just a taste

hello my name is Marlon bundo and I am a

bunny this is the story of my very

special day as usual after breakfast I

hopped to the garden to look at the

flowers that is when I saw him the most

beautiful bunny I had ever seen my name

is Marlon I said but my family calls me

Botes it's short for bunny of the United

States it's a long story

my name is Wesley and my family calls me

Wesley said Wesley we went on a long hop

together we hopped through the garden we

hopped right inside the old stuffy house

we hopped through very boring meetings

with very boring people at the end of

our hop

I said Wesley I don't want to hop

without you ever again and Wesley said

that's funny because I never want to hop

without you Marlon bundo ever again and

we both said we will get married and hop

together forever

[Music]

said the stinkbug you can't get married

the stinkbug was in charge

all the animals listen to him even

though he was very stinky oh boy

bunnies don't marry boy bunnies boy

bunnies have to marry girl bunnies but

don't worry we had a plan a plan that

involved all the animals in the garden

and if you want to know how the story

turns out you are going to have to buy

the book please buy it for your children

buy it for any child you know or just

buy it because you know it would annoy

mike pence you've been doing a nice

thing in a really dickish way and isn't

that the dream at the end of the day

again you can find it at better bundle

book con or if you would prefer at the

website focus on the firmly which we

also own now and additionally if you

prefer to donate directly to the trevor

project or 1898 if you make a donation

of 1199 or more you can get a free copy

of the ebook all the information is on

our website we've actually bought copies

but every member of our audience tonight

[Applause]

[Music]

we thought we'd update you on the

ongoing Trump administration scandals

that we've been calling stupid Watergate

a scandal potentially on the scale of

Watergate but where everyone involved is

dumb and terrible and bad at everything

now last month marks the one-year

anniversary of the murder investigation

or as the president and his supporters

call it Robert Muller's illegitimate

runaway which on it is and it has been

from the beginning a witch-hunt this is

a witch-hunt this is a witch-hunt

basically a witch-hunt though witch-hunt

if you will it's a damn witch hunt yes

they've been derisive ly referring to

the Miller investigation as a witch hunt

which is a little ironic because you

just know if Giuliani Hannity and Trump

had been alive back when people burned

witches they'd have had front-row seats

toasting marshmallows while trying to

conceal their bonus now it's also a

strange claim considering that mullahs

team has in the past year charged 20

people and three companies and gathered

five guilty pleas so if this is a witch

hunt witches exist meaning we should

probably change all references on our

history books to 16th century witch

hunts to read that time we were right to

murder all those teenage girls in a lake

and the fact the investigation has been

moving fast is good news because set

aside for right now how you feel about

Trump or politics the question did a

hostile foreign government trying to

manipulate our election is something any

reasonable person should want answered

quickly and yet an increasing number of

Americans seem to want the investigation

to stop last July

support for investigation stood at 62%

but a recent poll found it's now down to

just 54 percent and that is troubling

because remember Trump was actually

considered shut in the investigation

down before and if that number keeps

dropping he may well feel empowered to

try and actually do it so tonight let's

talk about the Muller investigation not

about its contents because we don't know

what they are yet but about the effort

to actively undermine it not just from

Trump and his lawyers but from and more

importantly than you might think

Trump's TV friends specifically pumpkin

Dada captain Virgin bad judge whiter

megyn kelly the dunce bust the dunce

bust junior for presidents and of course

Michael Cohen client number three Sean

Hannity and

voted most by nana nice new

glasses magazine and if you think it

will hold on I don't watch Fox News I

tune all of that stuff out it's actually

important that you know what's been

happening on it for reasons that and I

cannot believe I'm saying this Rudy

Giuliani explained best because when he

was recently asked why he was going

around spouting unsubstantiated nonsense

he offered this explanation eventually

the decision here is going to be

impeached not impeach members of

Congress Democrat and Republican are

going to be informed a lot by their

constituents so our jury

is me as it should be is the American

people you know what he's right he's

related by blood to his first wife but

he is right because because it is the

long-standing view of the Justice

Department that you cannot indict a

sitting president so to the extent that

Trump can be held accountable it's gonna

be through impeachment where public

opinion is key basically when Giuliani

goes on TV he's arguing to the jury and

that is us and I know you're probably

thinking right now

jury duty time to act like a racist

idiot to get out of it well that is not

a disqualifier this time not by a

longshot

so with that in mind let's look at a few

techniques that they've been using to

influence public opinion and the first

involves attempting to redefine the

investigation on their terms because

whenever they discuss it it's inevitably

framed like this Muller is there to show

collusion between Russia and Trump and

there's none so far so why not end it

where is any evidence of collusion show

us nothing so far

not a whiff there is zero evidence of

Russia collusion so just so we're clear

everyone forwards conclusion collusion

no illusion delusion yes I just thought

we'd have some fun with words oh well we

didn't we didn't have fun with words

there all we did was witness the closest

anyone in the Trump administration has

ever come to making or hearing rap music

but it is important to remember Muller

wasn't tasked with finding proof of

collusion the word collusion doesn't

even appear in his appointment letter in

actuality he was tasked with looking

into links and coordination between the

Russian government and anyone associated

with the Trump campaign as well as any

matters that

rose or may arise directly from the

investigation that's a pretty broad

mandate so saying the investigation has

to shut down if there's no collusion is

like saying a game of Scrabble has to

end because you fit all the letters in

your mouth well congratulations but

those aren't really the rules that we

agreed to and that is far from the only

diversionary tactic here there's also

what about ISM now we talked about this

on the show before it's the practice of

shifting the debate to someone else's

wrongdoing the master of this is Sean

Hannity and he responds to any negative

news about Trump with epic rounds of the

what about game we have a two-tier

justice system what about fired FBI

director James Comey what about Bruce

and Nellie or what about anti Trump

lovebirds struck in Paige what about

lying Susan Rice what about Christopher

steal the foreign national that fusion

GPS hired and funneled the money Hillary

did through the law firm and a foreign

national about Russian lies to influence

the American people in an election what

about who lied to the FISA Court judges

that is a lot of names to throw up on a

screen and just say what about them it's

also a little easy as an argument I'll

prove it

hey Sean have you thought about these 15

people what about them what about

Archduke Ferdinand Shawn

what about cher we're not talking about

the FBI until you answer what about cher

Shawn now and it is point there is that

other people did bad things

so therefore Trump's bad things don't

count and look let me be clear on this

whether or not someone else did

something shitty has no bearing over

whether you did something shitty if that

were true every movie that got a bad

review could simply say what about from

Justin to Kelly and the critic would be

legally required to give them movie five

stars that what about ism is an

important part of the third tactic on

display here building a

counter-narrative essentially trying to

delegitimize the investigation by

framing it as part of a grand conspiracy

to bring down trump kennedy has a series

of carry from homeland ease off her meds

conspiracy boards with muller and

clinton as the head of two different

crime families and whatever the is

happening on this one

night after night Hannity paints a

picture where the investigation is

itself one gigantic scandal with the

Democrats the FBI the deep state and

establishment Republicans teaming up to

take down Trump and he's got a favorite

phrase to convey its scope this is

bigger than Watergate

that's like watergate's like stealing a

Snickers bar makes Watergate look look

like stealing a Snickers

this makes Watergate like stealing a

Snickers bar that's just an odd number

of mentions for Snickers considering it

doesn't sponsor Hannity show presumably

Snickers simply couldn't hang with big

hitters like his actual advertisers my

pillow recta care cream and of course

sock slider it's true take a look you

scream you scream you're so far away

just bending over to put on your socks

is brutally painful every day we'll not

anymore introducing sock slider the pain

breed no bend over way to comfortably

put on your socks every day waiting for

someone to invent a gadget that I can

preload with a sock condom and then

thought my way to comfort everyone

unsurprisingly Hannity's narratives tend

to fall apart pretty quickly take two of

the names on his family feud board Peter

struck and Lisa Paige they are FBI

agents who worked on the investigations

into both Hillary and Trump and the key

thing you learn about them if you follow

conservative media at all is that they

were making sex at each other did these

two cheating lovebirds who are still

married as other people at the time have

any opportunity to actually do their

jobs at the FBI there she is

FBI love bird Lisa Paige Peter struck

and is in office fellow FBI agent and

secret lover

Lisa Paige Peter struck who along with

his girl mod Lisa Paige another FBI

lawyer are getting off in their fight to

save the country of Donald Trump oh yeah

they were

they were doing the nasty doing the slam

bam in the ham stuffing the muffin

fishing for kippers they were poking

them in 44 and piecing them in 52 they

slid the wand into the Goblet of Fire

they were dining at the all you can bong

buffet at pjo parkington's they were

having an affair and in doing that in

having that affair they apparently

relied on FBI work phones to hide it

from one of their spouses which is

undeniably bad judgment plus texts like

these made it clear that they very much

preferred a Hillary presidency to a

Trump on which is a political opinion

they're entitle to as long as it doesn't

affect their work at all and the DOJ is

looking into that question right now but

Robert Mueller himself didn't wait he

removed struck from the investigation

immediately when he learned about the

text and Paige had already left so these

two people haven't been part of this

investigation for nearly a year now and

the Wall Street Journal read these 7,000

messages between them and found that

they show no evidence of a conspiracy

against Trump and just for a moment

spare a thought for the reporter who had

to read 7,000 sets between two horny FBI

agents that's not why they got into the

game but Hannity still brings up

striking page all the time as just two

of the many threads in this elaborate

counter narrative his latest obsession

is something called spy gate the

inaccurate claim that the FBI planted a

mole in the Trump campaign now here is

what the spy gate story is actually

based on as part of the effort to

investigate Russia's meddling in the

election FBI agents sent an informant to

talk to two Trump campaign advisers who

have suspicious contacts linked to

Russia that's it that is the whole thing

but here is how their theory is

Republican congressman trey Gowdy who

you may remember let a more than

two-year inquiry into Benghazi so he's

someone who is no stranger to digging

for dirt on Hillary even he says this is

nonsense you believe the FBI acted

properly in this matter based on what I

have seen I don't know what the FBI

could have done or should have done

other than run out a lead that someone

loosely connected with the campaign was

making assertions about Russia I would

think you would want the FBI to find out

whether or not

there was any validity to what those

people were saying right he's saying the

FBI did what they were supposed to do

and the headline FBI investigates

possible crime it's like the headline

Domino's delivers pizza or

harley-davidson sells midlifecrisis

'mobile to local dad yep no kidding

that's their whole reason for existence

and yet rather than accept that push

back some Trump supporters turned on

Gaudi instead I'm naming names here I'm

through with it I mean trey gowdy is

really schizophrenic he he is absolutely

in the service of the establishment and

and the deep state where they're

intentionally consciously or

purposefully he is exactly that and

that's the problem

anyone who questions the conspiracy

becomes part of the conspiracy itself

and for the record the only thing that

is completely schizophrenic about trey

Gowdy is his hairstyle over the years I

mean what exactly is happening here look

Trey Trey my friend when you are born

with bad hair just pick a look and stay

with it trust me man

I am an expert on this the point here is

this machine is now running so

aggressively that even evidence can't

slow it down

and if you want more proof of that just

watch Hannity actively admit it in real

time no evidence of Trump Russia

collusion Muller if you got it come on

the show and tell America and by the way

if the media if you have more proof that

this is not a witch hunt okay I don't

believe you Wow give me facts and even

if you do I won't believe them he's

basically bragging that he's proof proof

which is a superpower that no one should

want to have like the ability to throw a

baby a hundred yards with a perfect

spiral sure it's technically impressive

but maybe don't do it and all this can

make it easy to forget just how bad what

we actually do know already is just as

one example

we know that in 2016 Don junior

knowingly set up a meeting in Trump

Tower with a person described to him as

a Russian government attorney with the

promise that the person would provide

information that would incriminate

Hillary and her dealings with Russia as

part of Russia and it's government

supports for mr. Trump and we

oh this not because of the Malheur

investigation or because there was a spy

in the campaign or because these two

fuck-buddies teamed up to frame anyone

we know it because Don jr. tweeted out

the emails setting up the meeting ahead

of a newspaper publishing them so that

story's just a fact and one that looks

very bad for Trump but if you think

Hannity isn't up to the challenge of

deflecting that one as well

just watch him go to work remember the

now-infamous

2016 trump tower meeting between Donald

Trump jr. Russian lawyer a Russian

American lobbyist and a few others oh we

have new information recently unearthed

a transcript from a 2017 Senate hearing

that the Russian American lobbyists

admitted to personally knowing Hillary

Clinton so let me get this one straight

you seem to be employing Hillary Clinton

sent someone in to Trump Tower to offer

her opponent dirt on herself

you know what congratulations Sean

Hannity you have officially come up with

the shittiest conspiracy theory ever and

none of this even addresses the most

obvious question if absolutely everyone

from Hillary to the FBI to tri-county

was in on a deep state plan to sabotage

Trump how the is he president right

now basically everyone in the country

got together to steal an election and

then for some reason forgot to do it and

look we could pick apart conspiracies

all nights but there is really at the

end of the day no point because they'll

always be another rabbit hole a

metaphorical rabbit hole that is not to

be confused with the rabbit hole the gay

club where years ago a young Marlon

bundo finally allowed his curiosity to

overpower shyness

[Applause]

really special himself but creating

rabbit holes is kind of the point here

because I would argue the Hannity Trump

and all the rest aren't really

interested in getting to the bottom of

any of these questions they're just

trying to sow enough doubt that this

number dips far enough below 50% to

enable the whole investigation to be

shut down they are just working the jury

and if you've seen any focus groups on

TV you know that at least some jurors

are really listening they call the first

by created by the deeps team it was a

witch-hunt to overturning election all

of this stuff that they say that Trump

did they're finding out that the

Democrats did it's been going on for a

year and a half they've found nothing

where he told oh there's something

there's something we'll find a bull

fighter

there's nothing exactly in this piece

we've argued that the taxes that you've

seen tonight are transparent illogical

and dumb but the other thing they

definitely are is depressingly effective

and the thing is these tactics have

worked in the past quite famously in

fact think about it

a sociopathic misogynist millionaire

evolved from celebrity to undeserving

folk hero suddenly has evidence piling

up that he may have done something

terrible and he puts the whole system on

trial if that sounds familiar at all to

you it's because it's basically the

story of OJ all over again Trump is

going full o je and it's working now

what does it mean to go full o je well

at once sense it means to murder two

people but but it also means to sway a

jury by building a wild implausible

conspiracy that the system is corrupted

the reason haniss he throws out so many

theories may well be that he knows if he

can discredit any part of mullahs

investigation he convinced people the

whole thing is a total sham and that is

the same angle that OJ's lawyers took

just listen to one of them tried to

discredit all evidence because of doubts

that he'd raised over a blood-soaked

sock

if they manufactured evidence on the

sock how can you trust anything else and

the jury bought that although I will say

I also do have questions over how police

got their hands on those socks because

the sock slider hadn't even been

invented back

it's impossible and sure sure there are

differences between the two defenses the

OJ trial had if it doesn't fit you must

acquit we have collusion delusion

conclusion illusion which if anything is

even dumber and look I am NOT saying

that Trump is guilty we honestly don't

know but even if the mullet

investigation doesn't prove that Trump

personally colluded with the Russians

that doesn't mean the whole thing was a

witch-hunt or a waste of time the

process of finding out is really

important and it needs to be seen

through to its conclusion and my fear

right now is that we are headed in a

direction where even if Muller comes

back with irrefutable evidence trunk

could just pardon himself and put out a

book called if I did it and a very large

portion of the country would buy

it

you

science the thing we love and respect so

much we only allow scientists to be

portrayed by the likes of Arnold

Schwarzenegger Nicolas Cage and Al

Pacino that is how much we respect them

and the complexity of the work they do

science is constantly producing new

studies as you would know if you ever

watch TV a new study shows how sugar

might feel the growth of cancer a new

study shows late night snacking could

damage the part of your brain that

creates and stores memories a new study

finds pizza is the most addictive food

in America a new study suggests hugging

your dog is bad for your dog a new study

showing that drinking a glass of red

wine is just as good as spending an hour

at the gym what

that last one doesn't even sound like

science it's more like something you're

sassy aren't would wear on a t-shirt and

when studies aren't blanketing TV

they're all over your Facebook feed with

alerts like study finds liberals are

better than conservatives at smizing

your cat might be thinking about killing

you and scientific study shows that

bears engage in fellatio and by the way

I'm not interested let me know when

Bears start engaging in some mutually

pleasurable sixty-nining hashtag bear

pleasure

hashtag feminism fold up exactly Tom

calm once even ran the headline

scientists say smelling farts might

prevent cancer which I would say was the

most unfortunate thing time ever

published but then this is a magazine

that once did a cover story on those

Asian American whiz kids the point is

there are now so many studies being

thrown around they can seem to

contradict one another in just the last

few months we've seen studies about

coffee that claim it may reverse the

effects of liver damage help prevent

colon cancer decrease the risk of

endometrial cancer and increase the risk

of miscarriage coffee today is like God

in the Old Testament it will either save

you or kill you depending on how much

you believe in its magic powers and

after a certain point all that

ridiculous information can make you

wonder is science to which the

answer is clearly no but there is a lot

of currently masquerading as

science so tonight we thought we talk

about a few of the reasons why and first

not all scientific studies are equal

some may appear in less than legitimate

scientific journals and others may be

subtly biased because of scientists

feeling pressured to come up with i

catching positive results my success as

a as a scientist depends on me

publishing my findings and i need to

publish as frequently as possible in the

most prestigious outlets that I can now

that's true scientists under constant

pressure to publish with tenure and

funding on the line and to get published

it helps to have results that seem new

and striking cuz scientists know nobody

is publishing a study that says nothing

up with acai berries

and to get those results there are all

sorts of ways that consciously or not

you can tweak your study you could alter

how long it lasts or make your random

sample too small to be reliable or

engaging something that scientists call

pea hacking that's pea hacking with a -

not to be confused with facking at which

as I think everyone knows is a euphemism

for the Phillie Phanatic

yeah pea hacking is very complicated but

it basically means collecting lots of

variables and then playing with your

data until you find something that

counts as statistically significant but

is probably meaningless

for example the website 538 at surveyed

54 people and collected over a thousand

variables and through pea hacking the

results was able to find statistically

significant correlations between eating

cabbage and having an innie bellybutton

drinking iced tea and believing crash

didn't deserve to win Best Picture and

eating raw tomatoes and Judaism and the

only thing tomatoes have in common with

Judaism is that neither of them really

feel quite at home in the Upper Midwest

but but you don't even need to engage in

these kinds of manipulations to get

results that don't hold up even the best

design studies can get flukish results

and the best process that science has to

guard against that is the replication

study where other scientists redo your

study and see if they get similar

results unfortunately that happens way

less than it should

replication studies are so really funded

and is so underappreciated they never

get published no one wants to do them

there's no reward system there in place

that enables it to happen so you just

have all of these exploratory studies

out there that are taken as fact that

this is a scientific fact that's never

actually been confirmed exactly there is

no reward for being the second person to

discover something in science there's no

Nobel Prize for fact-checking and

incidentally there's no Nobel Prize for

fact-checking is a motivational poster

in Brian Williams's MSNBC dressing room

and

and for all those reasons for all

those reasons scientists themselves know

not to attach too much significance to

individual studies until they're placed

in the much larger context of all the

work taking place in that field but too

often a small study with nuanced

tentative findings gets blown out of all

proportion when it's presented to us the

lay public sometimes that happens when a

scientific body puts out a press release

summarizing the study for a wider

audience for instance earlier this year

a medical society hosted a conference at

which a paper was presented comparing

the effects of high and low flappin on

chocolate during pregnancy if that

sounds narrow and technical it was

supposed to be there wasn't even a

control group of women who didn't eat

chocolate and the study found no

difference in preeclampsia or high blood

pressure between women who ate the two

chocolates so there is no way a study

that boring can make it to television

right well wait because that Medical

Society issued a press release with the

much sexier but pretty misleading title

the benefits of chocolate during

pregnancy and because most TV producers

just read press releases this happens

turns out if you're pregnant eating 30

grams a day of chocolate that's about

two-thirds of a chocolate bar not the

whole chocolate bar could improve blood

flow to the placenta and benefit the

growth and development of your baby

especially in women at risk for

preeclampsia or high blood pressure in

pregnancy except that's not what the

study said it's like a game of telephone

the substance gets distorted at every

step and I can only imagine how someone

who watched that segment must have

described it the next day or the new

said our baby is made of chocolate and

it's okay if I eat it but only 2/3

and and it is not like the media needs

help blowing things out of proportion

remember that time story about farts and

cancer it turns out the study never

mentioned either of those things it just

pointed out that certain sulphide

compounds are useful pharmacological

tools to study mitochondrial dysfunction

and while that time story was later

heavily corrected the scientist told us

that we still get phone calls and emails

from strange radio and TV shows wanting

us to talk about farts which is clearly

a waste of their time they're doing

valuable work they shouldn't be wasting

her time fielding calls from Drivetime

djs gasps man and the beef and there is

no doubt some of this is on us the

viewing audience we like fun poppy

science that we can share like gossip

and TV news producers know it that is

why you constantly hear stuff like this

men listen up

a brand new study says a woman is more

open to romance when they are full

opposed to being hungry okay first of

all no anyone is more open to

anything when they aren't hungry but but

you should know that study involved only

20 women and you cannot presume that 20

women can speak for all women this is

science not the United States Senate and

then there was this I'm catching reports

from just last year a university in

England says drinking champagne every

week may help delay dementia and

Alzheimer's disease they say only one to

three glasses a week how'd a day a week

they can be effective for your health

fantastic news no it isn't no no because

there's a big issue with that study

aside from the fact that if you are

celebrating with champagne three times a

week your standard for celebration need

to be much higher

champagne is acceptable on New Year's

Valentine's birthdays and if and when

Henry Kissinger dies and that's it that

is it that is the full list but the

bigger issue is that study was performed

on rats and how do you not tell people

that and how do you not also show them

photos of the experiments oh you'd think

they would have paired it with some

cheese but it appears they went with

cocaine got that Sheikh those are sheep

rats it's not the drugs that make them

cool it's their confidence but the truth

is while studies performed on rats and

mice are undeniably useful their

applicability to humans can be limited

the overwhelming majority of treatments

that work on lab mice do not wind up

succeeding in humans which means two

things a we shouldn't rush out to report

rodent results and be during lab mouse

funerals when they say at least he

didn't die in vain most of the time they

are like oh I know it hurts to hear that

but them's the brakes Mouse now now to

be fair it's not always the news media

sometimes researchers themselves will

oversimplify the science even TED Talks

which have had some amazing speakers

have also featured some morning show

style science in the past like Paul

Zak's

2011 talk on a hormone produced in the

brain called oxytocin which he even gave

a catchy name to this little syringe

contains the moral molecule it's so easy

to cause people's brains to release

oxytocin I know how to do it and my

favorite way to do it is in fact the

easiest let me show it to you come here

give me hook

there you go here's your prescription

from dr. love eight hugs a day we have

found that people release more oxytocin

are happier and they're happier because

they have better relationships of all

types dr. love says eight hugs a day

first of all don't call yourself dr.

love

that's the nickname of tabloid gives a

dentist to ejaculate it on his sedated

patients and second second there is no

way that I would be happier giving eight

hugs a day I'm English that is four

lifetime's worth of hugs I look but now

you probably won't be surprised to learn

the real science on oxytocin is more

complicated than the term moral molecule

suggests because while it has been found

to enhance positive emotions like

bonding and Trust researchers have also

found that it can enhance negative

emotions like envy and bias so while

promising the science on this is still

very much in progress which probably

explains why a recent survey of oxytocin

research warned the reports about it

influencing a large number of social

behaviors should be viewed with healthy

skepticism which is really a long

technical way of saying what you

probably knew in the first place which

is when a strange man calling himself

dr. love offers to hug you eight times a

day say no and you can see you can see

just about all of the problems that I've

described plus one more in a study that

made the rounds last year the new study

claims that driving while dehydrated is

just as dangerous as driving drunk

researchers say drivers who drank just

one ounce of water per hour

made the same number of mistakes on the

road as those over the legal limit with

alcohol doctor when I heard this I

thought this cannot be true yeah

obviously it couldn't because it wasn't

true as Britain's National Health

Service had already pointed out that

study was riddled with red flags

including that it was based on just 12

men of whom data was only reported for

11 and it got funding from the European

hydration Institute

a foundation that's received over seven

million dollars from coca-cola a company

that just happens to sell rehydration in

the form of a fizzy brown sugar water

carbonated urine flat urine diet you're

in and grapefruit flavored embalming

fluid and look just because a study is

industry funded or its sample size was

small or it was done on mice doesn't

mean it's automatically flawed but it is

something the media reporting on it

should probably tell you about and you

may think well hold on where's the harm

here so long as I don't try to fart

cancer away or for later bear no one's

getting hurt but I'm not so sure about

that because think of it this way this

is a chart mapping the results of

studies of things like coffee eggs and

wine all of them have been linked to

raising or lowering your risk of cancer

depending on the study and everything

causes cancer is not the conclusion you

want to draw from science it's the

conclusion you should draw from logging

onto WebMD where that is their motto

because if I were to tell you about each

of those studies in isolation at some

point you might reasonably think well no

one knows anything about what causes

cancer and that is a problem because

that's the sort of thing that enable

tobacco companies for years to insist

the science isn't in yet and if you

think I'm exaggerating about the impact

that this misreporting can have on our

faith in science look at an example from

some of the people most guilty of it

because the Today Show which lives for

scientific studies recently concluded

one segment like this like a lot of

studies that we love around here they've

been a couple especially related to

women write about the benefits as I get

all serious on whole milk hey-ho milk

but it's true there's a lot of research

though that says actually having whole

milk more having whole fat yeah

dairy products actually can help you

lose weight I think the way to live your

life as you find the study that sounds

best to me and you don't wish yeah no no

in science in science you don't just get

to cherry-pick the parts that justify

what you are going to do anyway that's

religion you're thinking of religion

that is what you're thinking of there

this is dangerous this is really

dangerous if we start thinking that

science is a la carte and if you don't

like one study don't worry another will

be along soon that is what leads people

to think that manmade climate change

isn't real or that vaccines cause autism

both of which the scientific consensus

is pretty clear on science is by its

nature imperfect but it is hugely

important and it deserves better than to

be twisted out of proportion and turned

into morning show gossip so if they are

going to keep saying a study says they

should have to provide sourcing and

context or not mention it at all and I

know what you're thinking what hold on

if that happens where am I going to get

all my interesting from don't

worry we have you covered

do you love science in all its

complexity but wish it could be a little

less complex in a lot less scientific

introducing Todd talks with a format of

TED Talks meets the intellectual rigor

of morning news shows

chocolate mmm it will kill you what if I

were to tell you all that the cure to

racism is coffee and in my research I

found out red wine makes babies 20% more

sociable

that's a baby we can work with and Todd

talks we've raised the bar on

entertainment by lowering the bar on

what constitutes science our scientists

at the skittles foundation for rainbow

tasting have done some pioneering work

we placed 37 volunteers from Tulsa

Oklahoma on an all skittle diet for six

weeks and guess how many were killed by

baboons 134 people lived two were killed

in a non baboon related murder-suicide

why did we do this because you love

science but you don't want to hear it's

process act really depicted on a stage I

conducted a randomized double-blind

trial on the effects of coffee on cancer

of the esophagus and while there were

statistically significant decreases in

incidences of cancer in the mice that

were given the coffee compared to the

control group any definitive conclusions

will of course have to await human

trials peer review and replication now

of course this I think what he's trying

to say is coffee cures cancer yeah we

didn't we

you won't find our speakers at TED Talks

because they're not afraid to ask the

hard questions our eggs good for you

where are they bad for you what if I

were to tell you they were both what if

I were to tell you they were neither

what if I were to tell you they were

both and neither

well yeah Todd talks feature the kinds

of scientific insights that aren't just

uncredible they're incredible

stand but - but with me boom by standing

but - but we can actually increase our

serotonin levels how do you feel uh

weird weird

that's the serotonin working hey don't

move I'm gonna step out gonna come back

in and give you a boost

how's that feel ah she's speechless if

you like the idea of science you'll

absolutely love Todd talks people none

of what you're hearing here is science

science is a very slow and rigorous

process that does not lend itself easily

to sweeping come close Oh take it easy

pal sounds like somebody needs a

serotonin boos come on bring it in Todd

talks have been called insightful

inspiring and a clear trademark

infringement I guess what I'm not even a

scientist but my study shows that you

seem 70% more authoritative if you're

wearing a lab coat and I am thank you so

much

scientists there you go

another scientist

Todd talks because science doesn't have

to be an exact science

you

[Music]

hello there I am John Oliver host of

that show you've heard some things about

but haven't gotten around to watching it

you think it's called last night this

week or maybe yesterday right now don't

worry you'll google it later now a few

weeks ago on this show you may remember

this happened

presidential clemency has always been

controversial from george w bush

commuting scooter Libby's sentence to

Bill Clinton pardoning financier mark

rich - and this is true Abraham Lincoln

pardoning a man convicted of attempted

best eality because the man was

intoxicated at the time the man in

question John Wilkes Booth it's true

it's actually not true but if it had

been that would have been amazing right

and you can read more stuff like that in

my book stranger than truth John

Oliver's 101 favorite history lies there

is absolutely nothing more fun than

lying confidently about history lying is

incredibly fun in fact the only thing

that feels better than lying to someone

is lying to someone then regaining their

trust and then lying to them again

studies have shown it produces the same

effect in the human brain that cocaine

does actually there was no such study

but it felt great saying that out loud

so it just seems like a fact so we are

actually producing that book next spring

it will be released as a hardcover

volume by Simon & Schuster who I chose

to work with given their wealth of

experience printing the factual sounding

of mr. dr. oz so who knew they

could do it well now in my book you will

find plenty of plausible but

unverifiable nonsense such as the fact

that due to a severe horse allergy Paul

Revere spent most of his famous midnight

ride sneezing and vomiting into the

streets so fact you'll also see the fact

that Irish step-dancing was invented by

the farmers of Cork County who used to

kill pesky field mice by strapping slabs

of wood to their feet and rhythmically

clobbering them to death

which it really makes you see Riverdance

in a whole new way you'll also learn

that in order to prepare himself for

important telephone calls Winston

Churchill would gather his

highest-ranking officials to watch him

tear telephone books in half and at

while we're on the subject of European

leaders will confirm that Catherine the

Great did die while having sex with a

horse but what many people don't know is

she was pegging the horse at the time

she was pegging that horse at the time

and one worse fact just forget about it

forget about it one last fact just wipe

it away one last fact did you know that

in 1980 Saddam Hussein received a key to

the city of Detroit that is not in the

book because remarkably that is actually

true I know that you don't trust me

anymore but trust me it is true so I

hope you enjoy just a few of my favorite

history lies for the complete list

purchased my book when it comes out in

April 2016 except there is actually no

book that was another life this entire

video has been a total waste of

everyone's time

if you want to waste some more time

please join us again September the 13th

when last week tonight returns until

then trust nobody especially me

[Applause]

a quick update about brexit which has

always been way too cute a name for

something so destructively stupid it's

like hearing your friend decided to

shove a snake up what became known as

his smash hole no don't reward it with a

portmanteau we shouldn't have done that

stupid thing and I'm afraid at this

point um for you viewers in the UK

once again you're gonna have to get

something different because the rest of

the world is gonna see a piece about

Teresa mais provisional brexit deal but

in that piece there's gonna be some

parliamentary footage and as we've

discussed before on this show it's

against the law for a comedy program to

do that in the UK which is and this is

true for King stupids now obviously that

puts us in a little bit of a pickle as

this show now has a six minute gap that

we need to fill you may remember last

time we ran into this exact same problem

we replace the segment with Gilbert

Gottfried reading three-star Yelp

reviews for restaurants in Boise Idaho

don't worry I am NOT going to do that to

you again because this time Gilbert is

going to be reading to you from Teresa

mais 585 page provisional agreement with

the EU Gilbert my friends take it away

article 130 specific arrangements

relating to fishing opportunities as

regards the fixing of fishing

opportunities within the meaning of

article 43 parentheses 3 close

parentheses for any period falling

within the transition period the United

Kingdom shall be consulted in respect of

fishing opportunities related to the

United Kingdom you know what you know

what this was a bad idea Britain doesn't

deserve this I didn't realize it was

gonna be this bad when I originally made

the decision to do this but if we've

learned one thing phone breaks it's that

an entirely reversible decision cannot

actually be reversed so Gilbert please

continue

article 11 single electricity market the

provisions of union law governing

wholesale electricity markets

listed in annex 7 to this protocol shall

apply under the condition set out there

in - and in the United Kingdom in

respect of Northern Ireland next article

12 know what you know what you know what

let's let's martyr heads prevail here

let's have a people's vote and have our

audience choose between listening to

Gilbert read this and listen to read

something a little bit more fun like

Bigfoot erotica so which is it to be the

EU draft treaty or the short work of

Bigfoot erotica Yeti set go I thought so

sadly there cannot be a people's vote on

this so Gilbert please continue with

article 12 article 12 state aid the

provisions of union law listed in annex

8 to this protocol shall apply to the

United Kingdom including with regard to

major supporting the production of and

trading agricultural products in

Northern Ireland in respect of measures

that effect I trade between the part of

the territory of the United Kingdom to

which regulation parentheses EU close

parentheses I can't I can't do this my

people in England are suffering enough

Gilbert's tell them about the big foot



picture the scene I a young nubile

wildlife photographer found myself lost

deep in the woods face to face with the

one they called Bigfoot let me tell you

it's true what they say about big feet

because standing before me was half-man

half-beast

his musk of moss and cedar hung in the

air his barrel chest heave and between

his legs swung what I can only describe

as a glistening furry forest lawn

[Applause]

picture of mink

biting an apple my mouth instinctively

dropped open in surprise and if I'm

honest anticipation this is going to be

the Loch Ness monster all over again

okay goober that's time change the law

UK or you'll get chapter two

next time

you

psychics the only people with more

misplaced confidence than Michael

avenatti now chances are you haven't

thought about psychics in a while which

is weird there's not really a whole lot

else going on but if you watch daytime

TV at all you'll see that they pop up

all the time when she was just a toddler

she's a wife and a mom who also happens

to talk to dead people

please welcome celebrity pet psychic our

next guest is a clairvoyant to the Stars

bond they're all psychic okay

I guess it's good that at least dr. oz

isn't wearing scrubs in that clip but

I'd still like him to do more to signal

he now lacks credibility as a medical

professional I think a sandwich sign

that says walking joke is the clothing

choice that I would be comfortable with

and look before we go any further I am

NOT going to be litigating whether

psychics are real in this piece for one

they're not see no litigation required

also for anyone who does believe in

psychic powers I know there is nothing I

could say that could convince you

otherwise logic isn't the reason that

you believe in them and it won't be the

reason that you stop which is not to say

that I won't be showing you clips of

psychics up but that is only

because it's really funny this is a girl

who you said was beaten and killed okay

this little girl is me and you told

somebody that she's dead wait a minute

you didn't disappear I'm right here well

that's interesting isn't it yeah

that is interesting I guess her psychic

abilities didn't include predicting when

she'd be utterly humiliated on national

television and look it is easy to

dismiss the psychics as a joke really

easy fun too

but the fact of the matter is one recent

poll found 4 in 10 Americans believe in

psychics just think about that

statistically that means out of all the

people who saw John Travolta's Gotti

movie four of them believed in psychics

so whether they are real or not is

incidental

what matters is a lot of people think

they are and the psychic industries both

larger and grimmer than you might assume

by one estimate it's a two point

two billion dollar industry and there

has been a lot of predatory behavior

when the the FTC settled charges with

the companies behind these psychic

readers Network in 2002 the one that

featured Miss Cleo they found that over

one three-year period they had charged

people about a billion dollars and a

collected half of it they took in five

hundred million dollars I had no idea

psychics could make that much money

he's like finding out the second richest

person in the world behind Jeff Bezos is

this gamestop employee named Greg I mean

good for Greg I guess but now I've got a

lot of questions about Gamestop and

literally everything else so tonight

let's take a look at the psychic

industry particularly one of the most

insidious parts of it

mediums people who claim to be able to

communicate with the dead they are

everywhere on TV some even have their

own reality shows she's a professional

psychic Mary knows bad 9:00 on TLC

spirit is important to me just as

important as my hair and my nails medium

only on TLC the crazy thing about these

shows is how they choose to focus on the

psychics personal lives who gives a

about that if I actually believed they

could communicate with the dead that is

the only thing I'd want to see them

doing the Long Island medium can ask

Abraham Lincoln Gandhi and Shakespeare

anything she wants so tune in next week

as she thinks about getting bangs I want

to mixed mediums make for compelling TV

most people have seen at least one of

them bring someone to tears with

messages from dead loved ones like this

did you lose your husband man your

husband wants to thank you for caring

for him and allowing him to leave the

physical world with dignity and grace

now that woman is clearly genuinely

touched although I will say it is weird

that the conduit to the afterlife is for

some reason Theresa Caputo living proof

of what would happen if you added too

much baking soda to Edie Falco

and while we're watching people tear up

can seem incredible the techniques that

psychics use to achieve those moments

are significantly less incredible

because there are two basic techniques

that psychics tend to use the first is

called cold reading it's basically

taking high probability guesses like I'm

sensing a loved one who had problems in

the chest area or is there a J or an M

in a loved one's name here are some cold

reading in action alright

and is there in theat like a Daniel

David like there's a big D so for me

it's initials it's usually on months of

the year like December being important

who is the MRNA mark Mary Marie they

don't have to be past they could be here

in the physical world

you know Maureen Mary Ann there's an M

name where's the M connection to you

does someone have a scar and the bun of

foot I do thank you cuz your daddy is

telling me there's a scar on your foot

she departed of Alzheimer's or some type

of dementia or something of the brain

and that you had to make choices and

decisions connected to her departure did

anybody have either a brain tumor brain

aneurysm or a cerebral cerebral

hemorrhage not connected to him not

connected to you somebody behind you had

that Oh someone been under had that nice

save buddy interestingly often turns out

that a psychics wrong guess is just

energy from somewhere else in the room a

room incidentally that he's very likely

to have someone who had one of the

problems he just listed because

cerebrovascular diseases are the fifth

leading cause of death in the United

States it's like asking a roomful of

praying mantises has anybody here lost a

loved one because you ate them after

having sex you know all those little

green hands are going up

the secret of cold reading is the

broader the generality the higher the

chance it resonates with someone it is

the same reason that fortune cookies

predict romantic developments ahead and

not your wife is gonna seem icy

withholding around the 12th of the month

that's because when she asked you to

handle the thing with the grout in the

shower she didn't mean be the plumbers

point of contact we keep abreast of

every step of the grouting process she

meant she wanted it off her plate and

she just feels like text in the middle

of the work day asking if she thinks the

landlord is gonna ask her the plumbers

insurance that's the off her plate

that's just new air and filling up the

plate instead of the plumber does that

make sense

Aaron it's not the garbage disposal

installation all over again lucky

numbers 8 14 and 23 and sometimes

psychics may make laughably sure bets

for instance here's John Edward in

Huntington Long Island a town where

nearly 1 in 5 residents are of Irish

ancestry is there a Brian Flanagan or a

Flynn or O'Sullivan or O'Reilly or some

type of whose past Brian Oh something

Flanagan Sullivan something like that

what are you doing Brian Flanagan or Oh

Flynn or Oh something he's supposed to

be speaking directly to people's dead

relatives not trying to guess the name

of the Lucky Charms mascot for the

record that leprechauns name ibrahim

abdul hameed been selling if that

surprises you maybe update you

antiquated Irish stereotypes

and once a psychic has you on the hook

they use your responses as well as

nonverbal cues that you may be giving

them to make narrower and narrower

guesses until you are amazed at what

they've just done of course it's not an

exact science it's not a science at all

and sometimes things do go wrong in fact

let's pick up John addresses reading

with the family of Bryan Oh something as

he doubles down on a bad guess I'm kind

of getting the feeling of not liking the

older female like not liking the mother

figure so if you tell me that you didn't

like you're his father's mother then I

would understand that I don't think I do

I don't think I do

I just want to be really clear because I

can't tell you what you want to hear I'm

gonna tell you what they're showing me

and if he's calling your mother a bitch

I'm gonna pass them on so what you want

about John Edward he's sticking to his

guns there none of that maybe this bitch

energy is coming from somewhere else in

the room nonsense this time no no this

time he chooses to go for it yeah Bryan

thinks grandma's a bitch and you know

what so do I now in fact hang on Amelia

Earhart just came through and she just

called grandma the c-word so don't be

mad with me be mad at Amelia Earhart

cold reading is basically just a magic

trick and yet prominent smart people are

willing to co-sign on psychics abilities

a few years ago Tyler Henry the

Hollywood medium and anime drawing of

Jared Kushner went on The Today Show to

do a reading of one of their anchors and

I'm afraid it's the exact Today Show

anchor that you are hoping slash

dreading it is there's a reference to

fishing but he's talking about being

spoken out loud to I know what this is

actually I don't know if you're aware of

this but he's acknowledging an

individual will be out on a boat and

it's like I'm sitting alone and I'm

fishing and I'm thinking that and he's

having me acknowledge this feeling of

like I'm there with you I'm there with

you um you know my dad shared two

passions with me he shared golf and

fishing night

and I do go out fish a lot alone on a

boat and this idea that that that might

be a time to communicate with him or

that he is attempting to communicate is

phenomenal to me yeah phenomenal it's

clear that Matt Lauer is touched there

and this time he didn't even have to

press were subordinate into doing it

maybe Tyler Henry just took a shot that

an older straight white male was upwards

of lukewarm toward fishing if he did

that would be cold reading but he may

have been using the other technique here

of hot reading which involves doing

prior research on a subject so for

instance he could have read articles

where Lauer talks about his father's

passion for fishing or seen interviews

little hour gave like this one my dad

taught me had a fish when I stand in a

trout stream now and I've got the waders

on and I've got a fly rod in my hand or

I'm fishing for bass I think about

sitting in a boat with my dad look

maybe Tyler Henry genuinely accessed the

afterlife an action which would

fundamentally change our understanding

of everything on earth or maybe he just

googled Matt Lauer dad and hit the

jackpot so so to recap hot

reading researching people beforehand

the even lazier skill than cold reading

which basically involves

indiscriminately shouting the names of

dead Irishmen in a hotel ballroom and

what's surprising is whichever technique

Tyler used Lauer fell for it and he is

smart he's a sophisticated Manhattan sex

monster but he fell for it

hard so hard he wanted to make it clear

to the viewers at home that this was way

more than just your standard TV

I tell you got home I cried I did plenty

of crying when I got home it's amazing

we want to let you know season two of

Hollywood medium with Tyler Hannah it

almost seems weird to be doing it as a

promo right now because it was so much

more important to me than a promo it

premieres Wednesday August 10th on our

sister network e well everything about

that is a little strange not least the

fact that it is weird to envision a

scenario in which something happened at

the Today Show offices and then Matt

Lauer was the one who went home and

cried

look you can see why people are

vulnerable to psychics

a message from a lost loved one is

something many people in the midst of

grief would do anything for and psychics

may tell themselves that they offer a

harmless way to deal with painful loss

in fact just watch as Theresa Caputo

pretty much spells that out in response

to a fairly obvious question so when a

tragedy happens let's say a murder if

somebody comes to a loved one and the

spirit of the person who was murdered is

there could that spirit potentially tell

you who did it they will acknowledge

maybe the relationship but never will

call someone out on the name why is that

my thing how I use my gift is I only

want messages that I got to help someone

for the healing process oh come on first

to be clear if I was murdered I would

definitely name names as a ghost it's

not like one of the rules in heaven is

go snitches get go stitches as we all

know the only rule in heaven is no

the clouds seriously it's a real

problem up there and to be fair I'll get

it they're so fluffy and you might say

at this point hold on where is the

downside in telling people their

grandmother loved them but I would argue

that at best it is reckless for a

stranger to take a stab at ventral

acquiring the dead loss is complicated

and mourning doesn't look the same for

everyone but at worst when psychic

abilities are presented as authentic it

emboldened a vast underworld of

unscrupulous vultures more than happy to

make money by offering an open line to

the afterlife as well as many other

services take Rose marks she

ran a lucrative psychic ring and in 2014

went to prison for defrauding clients of

more than 17 million dollars much of

which came from best-selling author Judy

burrow who marks had promised to

reconnect with her dead son and the sick

thing is parents in crisis are

frequently actively targeted by psychics

at their most desperate moments John and

Joann lowitz er have been searching for

their 17 year old daughter Ally since

she vanished last year but when the case

made national news

the Houston parents say they became

inundated with calls from so-called

psychic detectives they say some even

showed up at their front door promising

their psychic visions could help bring

Ally home he guaranteed me they need to

find Ally in three days and what parent

wouldn't be excited to hear that you're

gonna have your daughter home in three

days that is absolutely horrible because

the last thing any parent needs in that

situation is having to fend off an

attention-seeking parasite who feeds off

personal tragedy like a human sized deer

tick and the problem is TV actively

enables that ghoulish nurse the Montel

Williams Show regularly featured Sylvia

Browne a well-known psychic

who advised parents with missing

children on how to locate their kids on

one episode she advised the mother of

Amanda berry a missing child who had

been kidnapped now a man that was

actually alive and watching that episode

from captivity and after she eventually

escaped she talked about how watching it

had felt I would watch her every time

she was on Montone I say I wish my mom

would go in there and then she could

tell my mom that I was alive and then

I'm okay she but Sylvia Browne breaks

Luana's home I just hate this she's not

alive

I just broke down crying because I

couldn't believe she said that and that

hurt even worse that is heartbreaking

and Sylvia Browne is clearly an awful

person for doing that but I would argue

that Montel also bears some blame for

giving Browne a platform to begin with

put it this way if Oprah interviewed a

live alligator and it ate four members

of her audience I'd be angry with the

alligator but it'd also be kind of angry

with Oprah Sylvia Browne actually died a

few years ago or did she

people have been wrong about that sort

of thing before maybe she's alive and

watching me refer to her as dead the one

thing I know for sure is that Montel

Williams his show is definitely deceased

but but but daytime shows are still

holding hands with this

just last month dr. Phil had a psychic

detective on to help solve a cold case

and why would he do that the only

logical explanation for letting a

professional guess awayin would be if

dr. Phil was actually the murderer and

he was trying to throw people off the

scent but apart from that explanation

that now makes a lot of sense there is

no explanation although I will say this

every now and then when handled

responsibly a psychic on television is a

delightful thing just watch this

spectacular local news investigation of

a psychic named Deborah Dominique who in

exchange for 160 dollars

met an undercover reporter at a Denny's

our producer met her at a coffee shop

saying she wants to know what happened

to Matthew the ten year old boy in this

photo

after staring at his photo she uses a

special pendulum claiming it allows her

to talk with the day and then she claims

she is connected directly with memory

but is he because we're pretty sure

Matthew the boy in this photo is not

wearing white or in heaven in fact we

know he's wearing black and is alive

because you're looking at him sitting in

the boat right behind her yep

that boy is indeed in the opposite of

heaven he's in a Denny's but wait wait

till you see exactly how they Buster

because it is just perfect I'm Curtis

coming from channel 13 how are you

showing her the picture of Matthew she

tells me she thinks he was taken I

understand you said you thought he was

deceased yes I believe he could be I've

got news for you it might come as a

shock but he's very much alive oh that's

great he's actually standing right

behind you right now

it is great it is great it's utter

perfection the only way that could have

been any better is if the first thing

that kids said to her was hey mom and I

would argue that that is the only

responsible way to put a psychic on

television humiliating them with a ghost

boy in a Denny's parking lot because

this surprisingly large often predatory

industry relies on popular culture to

lend it credence and validity to put it

another way every time a psychic makes a

grieving widow cry on dr. oz 10 con

artists get their wings and that is a

problem because there will always be

people who feel an urge to reach out to

psychics in their time of need

so if you or someone you know is one of

them I may have a small way to help here

sadly this isn't really the best format

for me to show you so please join me on

the set of my new daytime talk show

instead

welcome back to wakey-wakey with John

Oliver it's some time between 9:00 and

3:00 in the afternoon then but my next

guest is a Staten Island psychic and

author of the book these freaking

spirits let me tell you please welcome

Wonder Joe Oliver

thank you for having me John thank you

it's lovely to have you here now Wanda

if you look familiar to some viewers it

might be because you're also my beloved

wife I'm it's freaking angel she is no

quick question Wanda Joe what happened

to your accent are you from the south

I'm not from there anymore that makes

sense no wonder when did you first

realize that you had incredible psychic

abilities oh well it was right after I

saw a thing on TV about how much money

psychics can make and suddenly I was

like me too

hashtag me too oh no no no that's that's

not that's actually a different year my

gift with the world no Joe I understand

that you've graciously offered to give

our viewers psychic readings for free

bingo bango as part of a court-ordered

settlement I've been forced to set up a

website Wanda Jo the free psychic calm

just log on now and you can get a

breathing for me Wanda joke just like

this okay they want me to acknowledge an

EM connection that could mean Mark or

Mary or Megan it could be someone who's

passed or still alive it also doesn't

have to be a name it could be any word

that starts with M or has an M somewhere

in it maybe maybe Museum Oh hamper it

could be an upside down and like a W or

sideways then like a three or an E

anyway that person he or she wants me to

tell you that the time you had together

was really special to him or her wow

that is phenomenal to me and it almost

seems weird to be doing this as a promo

right now because wonder gave me a

reading yesterday and it was so much

more important to me than a promo I

cried all the way home I told them none

of his dead relatives wanted to talk to

him that's that's so then the point is

go to wonder Joe the free psychic or

medium impressive calm and get a free

psychic reading we promise it will be

exactly as accurate as any psychic

reading that you would pay money for

oh wait wait I'm getting a voice through

for someone at home hold on your

grandmother's a bitch Wow

[Applause]

across the broad expanse of history

there have been billions upon billions

of idiots as well as a handful of smart

people we interviewed some of the latter

group for our ongoing series great minds

people who think good

this week's people who thinks good

Stephen Hawking professor Stephen

Hawking is a pioneering physicist

international best-selling author and a

popular guest character on The Simpsons

if you are looking for trouble

you found it yeah just trying to use his

breakthrough work on black holes and

string theory is considered hugely

important by anyone who pretends to

understand it an expanding universe does

not preclude a creator I travel to the

Department of Applied Mathematics and

theoretical physics at Cambridge

University to speak with one of the

world's greatest living minds first off

congratulations on being the first

subject of our great mind series be

honest is this the single greatest honor

you have ever received yes good it's a

little hard to read your tone of voice

when you say that are you being

sarcastic yes I thought so um if there

is one thing you want people to

understand about your work bearing in

mind that most people will never

understand anything about your work what

would that thing be imaginary time

people think it's something you have in

dreams or when you're up against a

deadline but it's a well-defined concept

imaginary time is like another direction

in space it's the one bit of my work

science fiction writers have used

because they don't understand it idiots

people are such idiots because

presumably to my mind you're simply

talking about the theoretical

measurement obtained from real time by a

wink rotation of pi divided by two in

the complex

plain where T equals I times T she's not

that difficult to get your head around

um let's talk about artificial

intelligence in a recent op-ed column

you said and I quote success in creating

artificial intelligence would be the

biggest event in human history

unfortunately it might also be the last

are you saying that robots are going to

destroy humanity and is that a

scientific argument or the pitch for an

amazing movie artificial intelligence

could be a real danger in the

not-too-distant future it could design

improvements to itself and now it's

murder so I know you're trying to get

people to be cautious there but why

should I not be excited about fighting a

robot littles well ok for start we don't

know that do we we don't know that for

sure because what could a robot do that

I couldn't then fight back with by

simply just unplugging him right there's

a story that scientists built an

intelligent computer the first question

they asked it was is there a god the

computer replied there is now an a bolt

of lightning striking a plug so it

couldn't be turned off holy that's

the most terrifying story I've ever

heard

yes hold on who is talking to me right

now is it you or is the sentient

computer pretending to talk on your

behalf it's me yeah but how do I know

that professor because if computers had

become sentient what better way to

convince people they hadn't then by

co-opting the voice of the most

intelligent man on the planet you're a

idiot yep but who's saying that Steven

you or the machine both of us okay

alright we got that's actually quite

reassuring

okay um in 2006 you said in a world

that's in chaos politically socially and

environmentally how can the human race

sustain another hundred years a month

later you said I don't know the answer

that's why I asked the question to get

people to think about it and to be aware

of the dangers we now face so it's now

been a

is since then no pressure but have you

come up with an answer yet I still don't

have an answer at least a chance of

nuclear annihilation has diminished but

there are plenty of other dangers out

there okay see that's pretty depressing

professor because if I can explain this

to you you're the smartest man on earth

so if you can't come up with an answer

we are completely

moving on sure you're book smart Hawking

but are you street smart I'll give you a

hypothetical you're a mid-level drug

hustler okay you control around 12 city

blocks one of your suppliers Tito was

supposed to meet you behind the

warehouse at midnight to give you half a

kilo of medical-grade cocaine

Tito shows up late but he doesn't have

the drugs he says he was jumped but he

looks high what do you move Hawking I

don't don't your ex yep do you know what

that's actually the smartest possible

answer because all drug kingpins know

you don't do your own yes

well-played Hawking well-played um

you've stated that you believe there

could be an infinite number of parallel

universes does that mean that there is a

universe out there where I am smarter

than you yes and also a universe where

you're funny look if you're so smart

what number am I thinking of what it was

13 I was thinking of 13 um

okay that was a lucky guess what am I

thinking right now disappointment your

family I wasn't thinking that what would

I think that you know I'm trying as hard

as I can

why is that so hard for them to

understand hypothetically I wasn't

thinking that let's do some quick yes or

no questions are the following things

technically possible life on other

planets is that theoretically possible

yes okay uh what about a Schwarzschild

wormhole yes okay what about this uh me

going on a date with Charlize Theron

yeah

not at all in in no universe or in in

none of the infinite universes does that

happen it's completely beyond the bounds

of scientific possibilities what you're

saying yes a quick follow-up question in

any of those potential universes and

either one rejecting her and that's why

it doesn't work out no you to realize

that typing your response is difficult

for me correct

okay sure yeah it's just I'm trying to

play this out because it just I just

trying to see if there was any

hypothetical hole it doesn't matter but

but never say never okay if time travel

were possible would you want to go back

in time and refuse to do this interview

yes you truly are an incredibly smart

man Stephen Hawking thank you so much

for your time

[Music]

science essentially math disguised as

dinosaurs and outer space to try and

seem interesting

specifically the story concerns

gene-editing it's a topic you may have

heard about given it's now a plot point

in action movies like rampage what's

happening to my friend are you familiar

with genetic editing changes will be

incredibly unpredictable is he the only

one oh you didn't know about the 30-foot

wall

[Music]

wait a second wait just a second let me

get this straight this is a movie about

aerial military equipment being

harnessed to fight a 30-foot wolf and it

is not called Wolf Blitzer that is a

huge boost opportunity that's movie

malpractice there look gene-editing

isn't only showing up in movie starring

rock the Dwayne Johnson no it's also now

constantly brought up on TV with with

varying degrees of excitement or extreme

alarm a stunning and controversial

breakthrough in science has arrived

gene-editing

this is a milestone that could one day

erase hereditary conditions some fear

the technology could be used to create

designer babies these technology has the

potential to change our DNA and the DNA

of all organisms alive and extinct could

that lead to eugenics could that lead to

new divides in humanity I don't know

that stuff is that's just scary

exactly it seems gene editing is either

going to cure all disease or kill every

last one of us and the truth is anytime

there is a bold new technology people do

tend to go nuts

I'm guessing after the invention of the

refrigerator there were a rash of

headlines like can meat be too cold and

what about the milkman America's

friendly neighborhood we're done so

tonight we thought we'd take some time

to talk about gene editing what it is

what its potential could be and what the

chances are that we're all going to be

killed by a 30-foot wolf and let's start

with the fact that gene noticing

actually isn't new there have been

technologies like these around for years

what is new and what is driving a lot of

recent coverage is something called

CRISPR which stands for crunchy rectums

in sassy pink ray bats

except it doesn't it stands for this but

you won't remember that and you actually

don't need to so let's go back to the

crunchy wrexham thing CRISPR is very

complicated but but one of the key

scientists who unlocked its potential

Jennifer Doudna has a simple way of

explaining how it works I like to use

the analogy of word processing because

it's very analogous to that you think of

the DNA code like the text of a document

this is the scissors that allows you to

cut out text change it the cell takes

over after this after

the DNA is broken and makes a precise

change at the site of the repair right

that is very basically it it's like cut

and paste in Microsoft Word if there's

something that you want to fix on a

strand of DNA with CRISPR you could

theoretically find it cut it out and

paste in a fix

at which point presumably Clippy shows

up and says hi it looks like you're

trying to play God and alter the basic

building blocks of life these sapele

Crispus potential is huge there are

hopes that they might eventually be

applied to more than 10,000 conditions

from sickle cell anemia to cystic

fibrosis to some cases of early onset

Alzheimer's but gene editing is wildly

difficult diseases typically have

multiple genes that contribute to them

and human trials have been extremely

rare although there have been some

promising results just months ago baby

Layla was dying of acute lymphoblastic

leukemia so doctors agreed to try out an

experimental immuno cell therapy which

had never been used outside the lab the

result astounded her parents I took the

gamble and this is her today standing

laughing giggling and I'm the fact with

a miracle that's fantastic

and he's right it is a miracle except

really think about it it's actually not

it's science which I'd argue is actually

better and more convenient than a

miracle because you don't have to spend

the next two thousand years worshiping

the scientist you can just be like

thanks amazing story for the most part

applications of Gina acing have been

confined to experiments on plants and

animals where the results have been

striking if often a little weird

researchers at this lab used CRISPR to

isolate and manipulate the beagles

muscle or myostatin gene making these

the most muscular beagles in the world

okay okay all right so you might think

it's strange that scientists mage act

sexy beagles but did you ever even

consider that the scientists were lady

beetles change your preconceptions about

what a scientist can be hashtag beagle

feminism hashtag science bitches

it's not it's not just we've paid

because scientists are researching ways

to fight human diseases using mice and

while scientists know how painstakingly

slow this kind of research is it is

tempting for the rest of us to start

racing ahead and wildly speculating

about where this is all going could

CRISPR give us unicorns so there are

examples of animals that have single

horns in the middle so like the

rhinoceros has one and its nose but

there are other ancient rhinoceros I

have it in the middle of the head so

anyway I think that you could get a

single horn on a horse by looking at

horns and other species so it's in the

realm of possibility yes okay so so I've

gotta say judging by all the hedging he

just did in that answer even if we do

one day career at a unicorn it's clearly

not going to be this majestic creature

who wants you to follow it into a magic

waterfall it'll be more like this a

monster that would beg please kill me

and this and this madness now in fact in

fact for a good sense of the mismatch

between expectation and current

capabilities just look at a project that

that scientist is working on right now

bringing back the woolly mammoth it has

been hyped in headlines all over the

world but they are nowhere close to

creating a living animal yet and even

computer simulations are underwhelming

in the lab they've edited about 35

functioning woolly mammoth genes into

the Asian elephant genome this is a good

start for making a semi woolly mammoth

yeah that's not a woolly mammoth oh

that's just a wrong elephant

it's not so much Jurassic Park as an

off-brand $3.00 petting zoo cause pet or

whatever but if you watch the news you

may have noticed that you're not just

seeing professional scientists and

that's because the underlying technology

of CRISPR is so cheap and widely

available almost anyone can use it so

gene editing stories almost always

feature a detour to meet bio hackers

like Josiah Zana here in the Bay Area

where visiting a bio hacker in his

garage he's selling CRISPR kids DIY

CRISPR kids for a couple of hundred

dollars you can buy this cutting edge

kit that allows you to use this

technology and you don't need anything

else you don't need a PhD and you could

do experiments with CRISPR like that I

think is really cool okay well sounds

revolutionary but to be fair selling

strangers things covered in unfamiliar

DNA out of your garage already has a

name and it's every single garage sale

in human history I would like to buy

your lamp please and then I'm going to

take it home and wash it and look he's

basically selling chemistry sets in the

extent that they get people excited

about science that's a good thing but

you can see why scientists get

frustrated when biohackers like designer

hog all the media attention especially

because he makes some pretty wild

statements like I want to live in a

world where people get drunk and instead

of giving themselves tattoos they're

like I'm drunk I'm going to crispr

myself which is a terrible idea

honestly you shouldn't even get drunk

and tattoo yourself however cool Robert

Duvall's face covering your midriff

seems at the time I'm just saying I have

some regrets

last October Xena even publicly injected

himself with DNA that had been modified

using CRISPR to try and give himself

bigger muscles which did not work but in

that same video he argued that using

CRISPR should ideally be like

downloading an app you don't have to

know what the app does how to program it

works anything like that and I think

that's the way it should be with genetic

engineering synthetic biology why can't

people use this technology without

necessarily completely knowing how it

works oh I can answer that one for you

because it could be dangerous and

someone could get hurt

also I refuse to take scientific insight

from someone shooting vertical footage

on an iPhone that is unforgivable that

is disqualifying immediately and now

says he regrets that experiment that

kind of behavior is a real worry for

serious scientists not just that a

biohacker will hurt themselves but that

doctors or scientists might rush a human

application before it's ready things go

wrong and the whole field is then set

back yes that is exactly what happened

to the field of gene therapy when a

patient named Jesse Gail singer died

during a poorly designed trial and

that's not the only thing that

scientists worry about because the

benefits and the drawbacks of gene

editing can extend well beyond one

person and to understand why it helps to

be familiar with a key distinction

somatic cells are most of the cells in

the body blood brain skin cells where

the DNA doesn't get passed down to

offspring germline edits involve sperm

eggs or embryos basically changing the

DNA of future generations

exactly somatic cells die with you

germline cells get passed down through

generations so much of what you've seen

so far tonight like baby Layla or Xena's

muscle experiment involved somatic cells

while germline cells are how my

great-grandfather passed this nose down

to me when he this bird great

grandma feathers

she loved bells germline editing could

potentially do incredible things take

malaria nearly half a million people

each year die from it and it's spread by

mosquitoes but gene editing could help

stop that through something called a

gene Drive scientists do this by

inserting an artificial gene into the

DNA of mosquito embryos that will make

an increasing proportion of female

offspring sterile the gene drive is

embedded in the DNA to ensure the

changes are inherited unlike natural

evolution where chance is involved

that's brilliant and it's honestly much

simpler than my idea to fight malaria by

just fitting millions of mosquitoes with

tiny condoms but but the moment you

cross into germline editing the

ramifications can seriously increase

because messing with any ecosystem can

have unintended consequences this has

always been true even before gene

editing and my favorite example of this

comes from Australia we're about a

hundred cane toads were introduced in

the 1930s to control the cane beetle for

the record they didn't do that what they

did do was multiply to hundreds of

millions of cane toads and wreak

absolute havoc Australians hate these

things there was even a documentary made

about them featuring a guy who made it

his life's work to run over as many as

he could well line them up with the

driver's side front wheel but I seem to

be able to get most of the ones I line

up on the right hand side of the road

well I really go out of my way to run

over cane toads basically because I have

a very profound love of the wildlife

that occurs here naturally if it was

possible to remove them and totally

eradicate

in Australia and I was capable of doing

it I would spend a lifetime doing

exactly there

Wow that guy is in for an unpleasant

surprise when he gets to the pearly

gates and finds out that God is an

Australian Kato so you'd like to get

into heaven huh why don't we go ahead

and take a look at the types the point

is ecosystems are very delicate which is

why you need to be extremely careful and

a good example of someone taking that

sort of care with gene-editing can be

seen in a project being considered on

Nantucket Island as a way to fight Lyme

disease you see Lyme disease is passed

from ticks to humans but before that can

happen

it goes from mice to ticks now typically

the way that works is like this and

mouse goes through a tough breakup it

was a relationship the mouse didn't want

to end and leaves it seriously

questioning itself worth the mouse mouse

goes on a series of rebound dates that

only deepen the disillusionment could

anyone love me the mouse wanders

despondent the mouse turns to alcohol to

numb the pain while drunk it comes

across a tinder profile of a tick first

then the mouse is disgusted but then

it's actually intrigued oh god it thinks

am I really going to a tick the

mouse goes on the date thinking it's

just a date we're just talking but the

mouse is lying to itself because as soon

as the tick says maybe we should go

someplace quiet where we can talk BAM

they're banging in the shower I dunno

afterwards the mouse feels strangely

satisfied it feels desirable again as

for the ticket can't wait to brag to its

friends that it just a mouse and

they both forget all about the encounter

until eight months later when the tick

gets a call bad news

you got Lyme disease and that is how

Lyme disease spreads from mice to ticks

sometimes other times the tick bites the

mouse anyway

the point it took to prevent the spread

of lung disease a biologist named Kevin

s belt is considering introducing

genetically edited mice that cannot pass

the disease to ticks and he would do

this with a ton of caution testing it on

an uninhabited island where the

experiment will be contained and it

would only go forward on Nantucket if he

got the buy-in of the local community

and even with all those safeguards he's

aware of the uncertainty although Kevin

s Pelt is confident his engineered mice

will only reduce Lyme disease and not

bring harm to Nantucket's ecosystem he

also knows that absolute certainty and

genetic engineering do not go together I

worry every day that I might be missing

something profound about the

consequences of what we're developing

good I'm glad you do because that is the

kind of caution that you want from

someone in his position he clearly

doesn't want to end up in a limerick

that goes there once was a man from

Nantucket who gathered some mice in the

bucket he altered those mice engineered

with a splice and now all of the

seagulls are dead and look there are

just practical considerations to

germline editing there are huge moral

questions too particularly when it comes

to humans because it raises the

possibility that gene editing could one

day be used not just to fight disease

but for so-called enhancement which

sells you into some pretty dicey

territory even Jennifer Doudna one of

the pioneers of CRISPR sees the danger

of this here she is telling the story of

a dream that she once had that was

pretty on the nose I walked into a room

and a colleague of mine said to me

Jennifer I'd like you to explain the

CRISPR technology to a friend and he

brought me into a room and the person

was sitting with their back to me and as

they turned around I realized was sort

of a horror horror that it was it was

Hitler and it was actually Hitler with a

sort of a pig nose and it almost looked

like a chimeric pig human sort of sort

of creature it's true she had a dream

about pink Hitler

wanting to learn more about CRISPR an

ethical reservations aside she might

also want to examine why her

subconscious thinks that one of her

colleagues is just casually friends with

Hitler

and look clearly the more control people

have over the ability to design their

children the bigger the moral questions

that raises up to and including who

decides what constitutes a genetic

problem that needs to be fixed is

deafness and disease many in the deaf

community would say it is not is

dwarfism a disease and he would say not

the idea that we're all sick that we're

suffering that I suffer from dwarfism no

I live with dwarfism

I've lived with dwarfism for 39 years

I'm proud to be a second-generation

raising a third generation of people

living with dwarfism

I don't suffer I suffer from how society

treats me exactly and there are many

groups who could justifiably worry that

the thing that makes them unique or

different could come to be seen as flaws

to be corrected and eugenics is a word

that rightly terrifies people it's why

it was such a mistake for Eugene Levy to

make that the title of his autobiography

it's a shame it's a shame it was a

lovely book as some great Catherine

O'Hara anecdotes were that that title

really dusted you off now here here is

the thing germline edited designer

CRISPR babies are still a distant

hypothetical no human has been born that

has had its germline edited yet and many

countries have bans or restrictions on

that but one place with very few

restrictions is China which in general

seems eager to push the limits of gene

editing and one of the scientists

working at that jack'd beagle lab seems

to brush off certain ethical issues the

CRISPR allows humans it puts so much

power into our hands it allows us to

shape our world in ways never before

imagined and there are many people in

the US who think well that's no that's

not for us to do that's that's for a

higher power that's for God alright so

the idea that we could

the role of God makes a lot of people

nervous mmm okay well that guy seems a

little bit blase about gene-editing

technology which is kind of surprising

in a country whose president as you may

remember from our show about China is a

honey eating talking bear that's the

resemblance is frightened I can't I

don't know which is which and look and

look my point here in showing you all of

this isn't to frighten you that there is

a lot to be legitimately excited about

here gene-editing has the potential to

alleviate a great deal of human

suffering but reaching that potential

will require careful time-consuming

research the science involved is much

more complicated than we've had time to

get into tonight mainly because we

needed to make space for that long story

about a tick your mouse and I

emphatically stand by that decision but

but well but while that research is

progressing we need to figure out how to

balance the risks and potential rewards

of gene editing which is going to be

tricky because everything that's being

done tends to get mixed together a

meticulous professional scientists with

freewheeling biohackers like this guy

practical applications with wild

theories best-case scenarios like ending

malaria with catastrophic prophecies of

30-foot wolves but but we are going to

need to sort out at some point

where lines should be drawn because

while Gina doesn't could do incredible

things for our health let's at the very

least in future try and avoid a future

where we end up swerving all over the

road try to run over all of the pig

Hitler's that we accidentally created

cars the muse for America's greatest

songs from the complete works of Bruce

Springsteen to Tim McGraw's ode to the

American truck that song is untrue 'king

believable make sure it doesn't really

make sense that they're just driving

around in an empty lot but it looks like

they're having fun so who gives a flying

truck but America's Auto obsession isn't

just a hobby eighty-six percent of

American workers get to work by

automobile and the remaining 14 percent

presumably commute by public

transportation walking or in the case of

that one weird guy in your office named

Nathaniel penny farthing bicycle get

down from there

stop it if you don't have a car holding

down a job can be a tremendous challenge

just watch one woman describe her daily

commute via public transportation

I normally still get the kids out on

their bus on time it's just a matter of

not whether I'll make my bus this is the

first bus and then I take two trains and

another bus normally it takes me roughly

hour and a half to two hours on an

average day if I were to drive to work

it takes me maybe 10 or 15 minutes so

how commute would be 10 minutes with a

car but without one she is literally the

length of the movie the imitation game

away from her job which is to say to

wasted hours that feel like forever but

but cars are obviously expensive which

is why many people have to take out

loans to buy them some from places like

this everyone has approved EDD buyers

auto sales regardless of your credit

even if this is my trade

even if I'm self-employed even if we

have to repossessions or foreclosure and

a bankruptcy everyone is approved okay

listen I do not mean to be judgy here

but don't approve the clown he's a clown

genetically speaking he is programmed

for murder now now that is targeting

people with bad credit who are only

eligible for what are called subprime

loans and nearly a quarter of all car

loans are now of the high risk subprime

variety in fact so many are being issued

they recently reached a ten-year high

and if the phrase a boom in subprime

loans is making your eye twitch with

flashbacks to the mortgage crisis just

wait we will get there but first let me

take you on a tour of the subprime auto

loan industry and we'll start with

so-called buy here pay here dealers who

do their own lending they've been around

for years and their ads make it all look

very simple how can we get you financed

when others can't two reasons first we

are the bank we don't have to send you

or your deal anywhere the second reason

we can get you financed is because we

don't even look at your credit score of

course in fact we don't even know what a

credit score is what is a good one

pg-13 640 on the verbal 710 on math 3

under par is that a good credit score

we've got no idea and that's why you

should trust us

basically it is a good thing that car

dealers lends money to people who can't

get financing elsewhere but in practice

these dealerships can trap people with

few options into paying vastly more than

a car is worth it's just one of the many

ways in which when you are poor

everything can be more expensive the

average interest rate and a buy here pay

here a lot is 19% with some paying up to

29% and that that interest is on top of

mock-ups and add-ons that can inflate

the price of the car so just look at

Arlene Jones she went into a Chicago

dealership trusting that they would help

her when she first got to the quick auto

lot she told the salesman she had an

upper limit on price she says he was

very reassuring in the end

Arlene borrowed eight thousand six

hundred dollars at twenty four point

nine percent interest over three years

if she had paid off the loan she would

have spent more than thirteen thousand

dollars on a car that was only worth

about three thousand holy that is

outrageous the only way to acceptable to

sell someone a three thousand dollar car

for $13,000 is if you slip a

mint-condition x-men issue one into the

glove compartment at that point you're

being generous but it's no wonder that

buy here pay here lungs had an average

default rate last year of nearly one in

three with most customers who default

doing so just seven months after taking

out the loan and just think about that

seven months is not a lot of time if you

put a seven month old baby in front of

the screen right now it would not

understand anything I'm saying it

wouldn't even know if I was making fun

of it I'll show you go ahead get a baby

right now and put it in front of the

screen here we go hey dummy you don't

know that I'm locking you you stupid

wittle folks don't know you don't know

you don't who knows about that but not

you at all see seven months is not long

enough to do anything now put the kid to

bed you're a terrible parent

but the problem is the problem is even

if you're just a few days late on a

payment the dealership can repossess

your car and when they do sometimes it

is with little regard for what's inside

when the mother went to pick up her

three children at a daycare she left her

nine-month-old in the car but when she

came out there was no baby and no car I

was doing repo car you check the car for

you take it that's really just going to

you know take my money baby

yes exactly don't take a baby is a good

general rule for everyone whether you

are repossessing a car

choosing a prom date or making a

selection in the NFL Draft

don't take a baby you don't take a baby

I don't care what they did in the

combine and and increasingly it is not

difficult for buy here pay here

dealerships to repossess your car

because many now install a special

device which goes off when your payment

is due every five seconds the device is

actually beeping at them as their way

all the way taking the kids to school

all the way to work informing them that

they need to make their payment contact

or lender however if they don't then the

device at midnight most lenders choose

midnight is their time of shut off

device will not allow that car to start

okay

stepping aside the horror of the fact

that they can shut your car off that

beeping sound is unbelievably annoying

anyone with a smoke detector knows it

only takes about 30 minutes of incessant

beeping before you've completely lost

your mind

I push the button I unscrew the top and

I smash that whole thing with the

breadmaker and it's still making that

sound

so the only reasonable option is now to

set my house on fire and once they have

repossessed your car these dealers don't

have to refund your down payment and

they might decide you still owe the

money because the car is now worth less

than they sold it to you for so you can

easily end up with no car and thousands

of dollars in debt meanwhile the dealer

can turn around and sell your car to

someone else so the truth is they can

make money either way and the same car

can get sold this way over and over

again and to prove that let me take you

on a magical journey because a few years

ago the LA Times tracked the sales of

one car

from my Kansas City buy here pay here

deal it was a 2003 Kia Optima much like

this one

it had a Blue Book value of five

thousand three hundred and fifty dollars

but in April of 2008 it was sold for

nearly eleven thousand dollars or double

its Blue Book value the original buyer

complained of mechanical problems and

refused to make payments so the car was

repossessed and sold again in August

before being repossessed again

four months later and was then resold

after just three weeks before being

repossessed again from a mother of three

who without travel transportation lost

her job at Walmart

it was then resold again in May 2009 to

an owner who complained of transmission

trouble so the dealer took it back and

resold it just four weeks later after

which it was you'll never guess

repossessed again from an owner who

later filed for bankruptcy thanks in

part to payments he owed on this

piece-of-shit demon car but wait we are

not done it was sold again that December

and was repossessed just five months

later before being resold in May and it

was then surprise surprise

repossessed again even though the owner

a mother of four claims she made every

payment and then according to the LA

Times it was sold one last time before

being repossessed just one month later

that one car changed hands eight times

in three years each time at a price

double or even triple its Blue Book

value at which point you almost feel bad

for the car which presumably needed two

sessions of therapy a week just to be

able to start it crappy engine again now

now that that is worth the LA Times

lefty but we felt so emotionally

involved we actually tracked that car

down and discovered that since then it

has been stalled again repossessed again

and then sold yet again and when we

called the last listed owner she said it

had been stolen and I really hope

whoever did that drove it straight off a

cliff although I'm guessing even then

some sleazy lobster wound up selling it

to a poor unsuspecting fish

now now after seeing that you may be

glad to hear that buy here pay here

lending has lost market share in recent

years unfortunately that is only because

it seems everyone is getting into

subprime auto lending now there is a

surprising amount of competition to give

car loans to people with poor credit so

much so people who've recently declared

bankruptcy are being actively targeted

through the mail just listen to one

bankruptcy lawyer describe what he's

seen these are all car loan

solicitations high interest Carolyn

solicitations sent to Mike bankrupt

clients people who have already filed

bankruptcy here's one that looks like a

check and it's made out to $21,000 I

guess it's gonna be a used car you know

with their signature and everything sent

to one of my clients here's one that

looks like some kind of an official

certificate they encourage you to apply

for car loan even if you suffered

bankruptcy car repossession foreclosure

or all the above that is a slightly

weird tone of voice to use there he

sounds almost excited about a bankruptcy

a car repossession and a foreclosure

he's like a doctor saying wow you have

herpes HPV and gonorrhea most people

only get one and this feeding frenzy

over subprime customers now includes big

lenders like Santander and GM financial

they are both expanded their subprime

auto financing and there are newer

players like Scopus and exeter who

specialize in subprime lending and you

might be wondering why the is

everyone in such a hurry to lend money

to people with bad credit

I mean sure in the mortgage crisis they

were doing that so that they could

bundle those high interest loans

together and sell them on Wall Street

but there is absolutely no way that that

is happening that is happening again

exactly what is happening right now and

people have actually been worried about

this for a while now is there a new

bubble that's about to burst in the auto

sector does this concern you at all

though that it could possibly become a

repeat of the home loan boom do you see

similarities between the housing crisis

and what's going on now with used car

loans is there concern now that there's

gonna be another subprime crisis except

it's not gonna be mortgages it's gonna

be car loans yes there is concern that

this could be the subprime mortgage

crisis but with cars and normally if you

add the phrase but with cars to any

historical event it sounds a lot more

fun like the assassination of Abraham

Lincoln but with cars sadly this is the

exception to that rule now before you

panic experts say there are important

differences here subprime auto loans are

a much smaller part of the overall

economy than subprime mortgages were so

even if they do go bust this wouldn't

necessarily be the Big Short all over

again so much as the director video

version with Brad Garrett instead of

Brad Pitt and instead of Ryan Gosling

and actual Gosling names Ryan and Wall

Street firms insist that they have

learned their lesson and have set things

up in such a way that tons of loans can

default and investors will still be fine

but there are trouble signs for instance

standards for some of the loans being

sold as investments can be shockingly

lacs we've seen deals come to market

with very low FICO scores and in some

cases no credit scores at all loans

which is amazing so some people joke you

know you really just need a pulse right

now to get a you know subprime auto loan

so that's a good joke solid setup hard

punchline potentially devastating effect

on the American economy top shelf comedy

there if the rule of three is what it is

and behind closed doors some in the

lending industry openly acknowledge

conditions are deteriorating in fact

when we sent hidden cameras to a debt

buyers conference in Vegas a few months

ago we stumbled on Ken chilsen the head

of the National Alliance of buy here pay

here dealers he sees trouble brewing

because he thinks in

to keep pace with the big players who've

entered the subprime industry his own

dealers have been forced to issue

longer-term loans with less money down

at higher cost to clients who are

therefore at greater risk of default and

these broader lending trends are clearly

terrible news for borrowers but to hear

him tell it it's a great opportunity for

those who buy bad debts and collect on

them these people Wow

that is both inspirational and

profoundly upsetting it's like if the

song I believe I can fly merged with the

rest of our Kelly's life listen listen

the news the news don't Google that

listen the news the news that used Park

dealers are predatory is clearly not new

but it seems these days market pressures

are forcing them to be more aggressive

and take more risks to the point where

we may be getting close to an industry

that looks like this

today too crazy Johnny Johnny but don't

take it from me take it from my cousin

crazy I got a question for the people at

home do you have bad coordinates we

don't care we don't care is your credit

so bad that giving you a high interest

loan will basically chop your dough

mountains that which there's no

reasonable hope of this game we don't

give up we've got a beautiful offer for

you right now man this here is a free

free free free free free pre-owned 2003

Jimmy Jimmy you gonna tell the people

when it comes well I will that comes

fully loaded with four tires one engine

and beeping device which emits a sound

that will haunt your dream does it come

with anything else it does matter if you

check the back seat this car is baby

there is an actual baby in this time

right now I have serious personal

reservations about the situation this

time and what don't focus on that look

this car is worth $2,000 but will let

you have it for zero down and just two

hundred a month for the next seven years

that's nearly a thousand don't do the

actual math on my don't think of it I

don't like this act now and this car

will affect every financial decision you

make for the best part of the next

decade and that is a crazy jolly profit

this piece-of-shit car is actually an

opportunity for Wall Street to but don't

listen to me listen to our accountant

crazy Walter

well it's true if you sent aside the

human misery this moment has the

potential to cause as part of an over

collateralized security this can be sold

as it as a hot time as a high-yield

investment goes up the barn it's so easy

for us to get you in this car why it is

almost quipment it truly feels like it

somehow joining us

Saudi Arabia birthplace of the Prophet

Muhammad the Prophet Muhammad our

graphics department must have decided

against that one for some reason

nao-san arabia has been in the news this

week for a truly appalling reason and it

has to do with Saudi journalists Gemara

Shoji a u.s. resident and columnist for

The Washington Post who has not been

seen since he stepped to the Saudi

consulate in Turkey to pick up some

paperwork 12 days ago this is a man

hostage captured on closed-circuit

cameras stepping into what Turkish

authorities believe was a death trap

Turkish authorities have identified 15

Saudi men as persons of interest only

hours before hogr she went missing

several of them were caught on camera

arriving in Istanbul a Turkish official

told the New York Times Saudi agents had

dismembered his body with a bone saw

they brought for the purpose it's

absolutely horrific and the Saudis deny

it happened although let us all agree on

this a bone saw in any context is an

immediate red flag thanks so much for

inviting me over for Thanksgiving Craig

the turkeys delicious the stuffing is

perfect that's a very large bone saw and

I just remembered I have to leave now

now Saudi officials have scrambled to

explain all the suspicious activity

surrounding his disappearance with the

Saudi own channel al arabiya claiming

that the 15 people who turned up in

Istanbul were just tourists which is

clearly given that flight logs

showed that most of the men arrived on a

private charter plane at 3:13 a.m. and

that all of them departed the same day

they arrived which is a pretty weird

vacation isn't it I want to see Istanbul

but only for a few hours mostly at night

and it need to bring a bone saw

also the whole we were just tourists

excuse isn't even a new one in the wake

of Russia's poisoning of Sergei ripple

the Russian suspects tried the same

thing what were you doing there our

friends had been suggesting for a long

time that we visit this wonderful town

Salisbury a wonderful town yes there's

the famous Salsbury Cathedral famous not

only in Europe but in the whole world

it's famous for its 123 meter spire is

famous for its clock the one of the

first ever created in the world that's

still working okay so first I love how

the reporter immediately became

suspicious when they call Salisbury a

wonderful town she knows what's up it's

like if you heard someone called celery

a delicious treat look I don't know what

else you're not telling the truth about

but now I definitely know you're a

liar and second it's famous for

its 123 meter spire they sound like

they're reading directly off the

Wikipedia page for Salisbury oh wait oh

I love Salisbury it's simple the

population is 40,000 302 and they're a

member of parliament is John Glenn a

conservative whose 80th tenure has been

widely viewed as a failure open brackets

citation needed close brackets all these

things are not looking good right now as

the Turkish government reportedly have

audio and video proof of the

assassination look this story is

incredibly grip because while this may

be the first that you have heard of

Jamar sociology he's long been a

significant figure in Saudi Arabia a

thoughtful and by no means radical

critic of the Saudi royal family and

this is all worried because the only

reason to kill a journalist in your own

consulate with 15 people and a bone saw

you flew in that day it's because you

wanted to send a message and you were

sure you could get away with it which

raises the question why would they be so

sure of that and part of that answer may

have to do with us so tonight let's take

a look at America's relationship with

Saudi Arabia because we have a long and

morally compromised history in in short

in very short four decades we have had a

relationship based on strategic

interests not shared values they have

oil we need it they opposed Iran and so

did we and for those and other reasons

US presidents have to varying degrees

been willing to pander to Saudi Arabia

and in doing so we conveniently turned a

blind eye to a lot of things from human

rights abuses to the Saudi leadership

role in funding religious extremism

even while partnering with us to fight

it it's always been a very complicated

relationship but in the last couple of

years it's actually gotten significantly

closer thanks to two new leaders Trump

and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and

let's take the prince first though his

father the king is still alive since

last year the prince has effectively

been running the country and has branded

himself as MPs the young new face of

Saudi Arabia he made the cover of Time

magazine under the headline charm

offensive and 60 minutes profiled him as

a progressive voice for the country his

reforms inside Saudi Arabia had been

revolutionary he is emancipating women

introducing music and cinema and

cracking down on corruption now there is

some truth to that he's attempted to

reduce the influence of some hardline

clerics he has agreed to let women drive

and he's allowed movie theaters after a

35-year ban although I will note that

one of the very first movies they showed

there was and this is true the Emoji

moon

which in hindsight is actually how it

was always supposed to be seen by a

group of people who had never seen a

good movie to compare it to now now all

of that has been combined with a major

plan to reorient the Saudi economy away

from oil and toward technology called

vision 2030

to that end MBS has gone on a world tour

this year to reassure investors that

Saudi Arabia is stable and progressive

and that businesses should feel

comfortable working with them he's

second meetings with Tim Cook Bill Gates

and Richard Branson and has eaten at

Starbucks with Michael Bloomberg

incidentally while the Starbucks

baristas miraculously nailed Mohammed

bin Salman and Bloomberg still ended up

with a cup reading Mikey Bloomberg as

part of his PR push NBS started an

annual business conference called the

future investment initiative or as it's

known Davos in the desert the first one

was held just last year at the

ritz-carlton in Riyadh featuring leaders

of many big-name companies as well as

the usual futuristic tech like

this we have smart investors here and

they are selective about what they

invest in well I think I'm special

I can use my expressive face to

communicate with people why is it

important for you to have an expressive

most of the time I feel positive oh god

oh god that is a creepy smile that's the

exact same smile that I've seen the

Queen give when she has to interact with

a commoner I believe you want some kind

of contest to come to my house and look

at my things what a positive day for one

of us

don't touch anything but mbss PR push

isn't just toward attracting businesses

is also toward changing the world's

perception of Saudi Arabia to that end

he struck a 10-year deal with one of the

most popular and most American

franchises there is World Wrestling

Entertainment all WWE they held their

first of many events there back in April

and audiences around the world were

treated to Walther war propaganda about

the new Saudi Arabia including a video

showing women happily driving men

dancing and tourist destination beauty

shots as well as constant excited

compliments throughout the broadcast the

course of sunny on its feet that area

has been reserved for the Saudi royal

family the House of Saud I want to send

a genuine thank you to the Kingdom of

Saudi Arabia Wow

it seems that WWE is avert approached

Audi Arabia as it is lately homoerotic

which is to say intensely but the truth

is MBS is far from the political

reformer that he's been presented as in

fact scratch any positive story about

him and you will find a much grimmer

truth underneath for instance what the

country did get headlines for ending its

ban on women driving just weeks before

authorities arrested about a dozen

female activists who'd campaigned for

the right to drive even that Investment

Conference had a dark coda because just

one week later at the exact same hotel

this happened new footage from inside

the ritz-carlton hotel in Saudi Arabia's

capital Riyadh shows the dramatic

transformation from a favorite haunt of

the well-heeled

into arguably the world's most luxurious

prison it's true MBS used that

ritz-carlton to lock up hundreds of

businessmen and members of the royal

family in a so-called anti-corruption

campaign at least 17 detainees were

reportedly hospitalized for physical

abuse and one Saudi military officer

died in custody which is obviously

insane and horrifying because the only

hotel where you expect to be murdered

days in paints their slogan days in

expect to be murdered here meanwhile bin

Salman has been aggressive with his

neighbors launching a blockade of Qatar

last year that continues to this day as

does an absolutely brutal war in Yemen

that has resulted in over 16,000

casualties and killed over 1,200

children the Saudi campaign of

airstrikes has been catastrophic as this

man attested while standing in front of

what used to be his home was there's no

D Arabia bombs without care how many of

your family were killed twenty-seven

lives 27 people from one family can you

think of any reason why your family in

this house might have been struck I am

NOT a leader or anything

I work as a barber that's clearly

terrible and for the record at the very

least there is no justification for

violence against a barber and that is

coming from me if anyone has a

justification for a blood grudge against

barbers it would be yours truly because

of what they did to me and yes as all of

this has happened our current president

has continued to bend over backwards to

accommodate and ignore bin Salman zwarst

excesses and sometimes even celebrate

them after that clamp down on corruption

at the ritz-carlton

many around the world sounded the alarm

but Trump went the other way

Trump endorsed Crown Prince Mohammed bin

Salman s new corruption crackdown

tweeting quote I have great confidence

in King Salman and the crown prince of

Saudi Arabia they know exactly what they

are doing right but just because they

know what they're doing doesn't mean

that what they're doing is good Michael

Jordan knew exactly what he was doing

when he wore this moustache in a Hanes

commercial he was seeing how far this

whole Michael Jordan thing could take

him and the answer was apparently

through Hitler and beyond

and that that actually fits with the

larger pattern of Donald Trump and Saudi

Arabia because since taking office he is

catered to cater to them at every single

turn he made Saudi Arabia the first

foreign country he visited as president

and he seemed to have an absolutely

great time there

dancing with a sword and famously

groping a weird glowing or after which I

assume Michael Cohen instinctively

offered the orb 130,000 dollars and told

it to keep quiet and look it really

shouldn't be that surprising to anybody

that Trump has so enthusiastically

embraced the Saudi royal family they

have the two qualities he admires most

in the world having a lot of money and

giving it to him he basically said as

much on the campaign trail Saudi Arabia

and I get along great with all of them

they buy apartments from me they spend

40 million 50 million am I supposed to

dislike him I like him very much yeah of

course buying an apartment from Trump is

a surefire way to get him to like you

along with wearing one of his hats being

under 25 years old with a size 30 of

double D and not being Eric he's a he's

a simple man

it's simple tastes and Trump's

businessman view of the Saudis as just

people with money don't ask too many

questions

has carried over now that he's president

when bin Salman came to the White House

Trump called a press conference in the

Oval Office where he boasted about the

amount of arms that they were buying

from us essentially using MBS as a human

easel some of the things that have been

approved and are currently under

construction and will be delivered to

Saudi Arabia very soon and that's for

their protection but if you look in

terms of dollars three billion dollars

five hundred and thirty three million

dollars five hundred and twenty five

million dollars that's peanuts for you

eight hundred and eighty million dollars

six hundred and forty five million

dollars six billion dollars that's four

frigates

but first has any human in the history

of the world more obviously just learned

a word than he just learned a word

frigates but second look at bin Salman

face there as it hits him just how much

Trump likes money it's like the face of

a babysitter who realized you can pacify

a screaming kid with Twizzlers oh I

thought this was going to be difficult

but if all you want is Twizzlers I've

got loads of them here take all you want

and shut the up

and look look I am by no means saying

the Trump is the first u.s. president to

make distasteful arms deals with the

Saudis we've been doing it for decades

the Obama administration still sold them

weapons even as Saudi Arabia got

involved in Yemen but Trump has

continued doing so even assigned mante

of Saudi recklessness in airstrikes two

months ago they dropped an american-made

bomb on a school bus full of children

but just a month later Trump's defense

secretary said that Saudi Arabia was

doing everything it could to prevent

civilian casualties and we carried on

supporting them my point here is at

every turn Trump has gone out of his way

to accommodate the Saudis he doesn't

even have an ambassador to the kingdom

our relationship with them is being

handled personally by Jared Ivanka

Trump's realdoll and and the Saudis seem

understandably very happy with that

situation Krishna took an unannounced

trip to Saudi Arabia in 2017 to meet

with the young Prince months later and

Bs reportedly boasted that Kushner was

quote in his pocket which bin said man

deny yeah of course is in their pocket

he's Jared that face was born to

be maneuvered into someone's pockets his

Secret Service nickname is probably

wallet keys and a little bit of lint so

so while the fact that the US has

enabled Saudi Arabia is nothing new the

extent to which Trump is prioritizing

money above all else is really dangerous

is it any wonder that they have been

emboldened here after MPS's roundup of

his rivals Trump tweeted his support

after his blockade of Qatar Trump for

some reason took credit for it and that

kind of has consequences

time and again Trump has chosen extreme

friendliness with MPs

a leader who

in the words of one Saudi critic has

created a climate of fear and

intimidation going on to say we Saudis

deserve better

that critic was yamaja shogi the

journalists who is widely thought to

have been murdered in the Saudi

consulate and while Trump has said that

Saudi Arabia faces severe punishment if

it's proven they were behind this does

anyone really believe that that is

something that he's honestly committed

to a much more revealing response came

in the Oval Office after the news of her

jokey's disappearance broke just watch

him render in real-time the cost-benefit

analysis that he was applying to the

situation again just took place in

Turkey and to the best of our knowledge

Khashoggi is not a United States citizen

is that right it's a permanent resident

okay we don't like it John we don't like

it and we don't like it even a little

bit but as to whether or not we should

stop a hundred and ten billion dollars

from being spent in this country knowing

they have four or five alternatives two

very good alternatives that would not be

acceptable to pick he's openly

demonstrating to the entire world and to

Saudi Arabia specifically that arms deal

much more important than butchered

journalists look clearly giving Saudi

Arabia green lights for two solid years

has had consequences and a lot of people

now have some big decisions to make the

second annual Davos in the desert begins

nine days from now and already all of

these companies have pulled out although

as of right now Treasury secretary Steve

minuchin is still planning to attend

which is ridiculous the desert is

comfortably hot enough without that

smoke show am i right

am i right smoke shop right

you can get it that's a me face am

i right am i right on that yeah now as

for the WWE while they say they are

monitoring the situation they're

gigantic crown jewel event is still

scheduled for November meaning John Cena

could well be back there doing this

which I guess in this context would mean

you don't see these human rights abuses

right here as for the president again

look every US leader has chosen to make

compromises when it comes to Saudi

Arabia but Trump may well be the first

one who doesn't see it as a compromise

because he and NBS are similar in some

of the worst possible ways they both

love money they're both a product of

inherited wealth they both love self

promotion yet disdain the press and they

even both share a design aesthetic that

amounts to Elvis tries to remember what

Versailles looks like but can't and

Trump's intense bromance with NBS is bad

news because when you set no boundaries

on an oppressive regime they are always

going to ask themselves how much can we

get away with here and as we saw this

week the answer to that may well be

pretty much anything

you

elections the only excuse for a grown

man to kiss a stranger's baby and not

have the cops court as you may know

there was an important election coming

up we're just about a year away from

when American voters will head to the

polls and choose the next president of

the United States can Ben Carson

actually win the Republican nomination

can Bernie Sanders take Iowa and New

Hampshire the biggest question right now

is will Vice President Joe Biden throw

his hat in the ring will Al Gore run for

president no he won't

and who gives a it's still a year

from now by the time it's done the 2016

election will have lasted the entire

lifespan of a hamster from birth all the

way to popsicle stick grave we should

not be talking about the 2016 race when

America has very important elections

taking place this Tuesday in just two

days

there are gubernatorial and all

legislative elections taking place in

these four states and many other people

will be voting in local elections or on

important referenda like Washington

State initiative 1401 which would

prohibit people from selling buying

trading or distributing parts of

elephants rhinoceroses tigers cheetahs

and pangolins and if you're wondering

what a Pangolin is lets me show you

the Pangolin is not very ferocious it

doesn't even have teeth

and it's not very fast in fact it has to

wobble on a time legs and tail

what is that ridiculous mess

it looks like the result of a

Stegosaurus making love to an artichoke

look if you're thinking right now what I

don't live in one of those four states

and I'm not a Pangolin why should I give

a

well let me tell you there are American

lives at stake here because a number of

these elections could determine whether

hundreds of thousands of people remain

in or even fall into what's known as the

Medicaid gap and I know that sounds like

a terrible clothing chain where you can

buy cocky hospital gowns sold by

children in India but amazingly it's

even worse than that meet Kathy Owen a

Texas woman who can't afford insurance

has a family history of colon cancer and

is desperately saving up for a

colonoscopy $8,000 stands between me and

maybe another 20 years of my life if I

have colon cancer but I find myself now

at 53 with grown kids and serious need

of help hard to ask for but absolutely

necessary that's just terrible

$8,000 should not be the difference

between living or dying it should be the

difference between buying this

authenticated bass guitar signed by Paul

McCartney and this baseball supposedly

signed by Kanye West and by the way why

does that object exist it's Kanye West

interrupting baseball games now imma let

you finish this pitch but my signature

is the greatest signature of all time of

all time look if your instinct is wasn't

Obamacare supposed to solve this kind of

problem well yes you're right it was to

oversimplify things just a bit the idea

was under Obamacare people without

insurance will be split into two groups

those who made upwards of 138 percent of

the poverty line would be eligible to

buy insurance with subsidies up to a

certain point and as for the poorest

Americans Medicaid which is previously

generally applied to children their

parents

disabled would have been expanded to

include everyone else at which point

with everyone insured America is

supposed to go outside brush the dead

leaves off the trampoline and celebrate

with a backflip and a broken tibia the

Supreme Court even famously upheld

Obamacare in 2012 what you may not

remember is that even that very day

there were hints it may not have been an

unequivocal victory John Roberts sided

with the four liberal justices voting

five to four to uphold nearly all of

President Obama's health-care law and

there's the problem because nearly all

is not a reassuring statement health

care is like a pair of gym shorts even

if it covers nearly all of what it's

supposed to you're still left with some

problematic gaps and terrible things can

happen let me explain the Supreme Court

struck down the part of the law which

enabled the government to force States

to expand Medicaid which meant states

could choose to reject the expansion

even though that that would be an odd

decision under the law the federal

government would pay a hundred percent

of the cost for the first three years

eventually decreasing to 90 percent and

I can't think of anything I would not

buy if I only had to pay ten percent of

the price Fred Claus on DVD I mean no

thank you but yes I'll take it Vince

borne is always good for 49 cents worth

of yucks basically for the relatively

little of their own money states could

cover all their poorest citizens it was

an exceptionally favorable deal but

guess what many states chose to do Texas

will not be participating in Medicaid

expansion they're working hard to change

the American dream into the European

nightmare this system we call Obamacare

that we now see is going to be a train

wreck and I do not want the name of

Mississippi emblazoned across that train

when it leaves the tracks

would you consider expanding a broken

system of course not

of course not it's like a drug dealer

you give them your first hit free and

then they're hooked for years and years

yeah except in this instance that drug

addict has cancer the drug being pushed

is chemo and the corner boys have seven

years of med school

20 states have so far declined to expand

Medicaid leaving over 3 million people

in the Medicaid gap people in the

illogical situation of not making enough

money to receive government assistance

just listen to LaShawn B hoard diabetic

who at one point was forced to reuse

needles to save money I don't make

enough money to get the insurance

through federal government and then I

made two months to get Medicaid and I

cannot afford the insurance that's

offered at my job so um I'm just hanging

in the air it's hard to explain how

disappointing it is ok the word

disappointing does not quite cover it's

disappointing

is your child dropping out of college to

be a street mime Gerald your mother's

devastated do not pretend you can't hear

me inside that glass box I know you can

hear me Gerald this kind of situation is

not disappointing it's tragic the

frequent argument for states refusing

the expansion is they couldn't bear the

increased cost although it is worth

noting that to their credit even

fiscally conservative Republican

governors like Jan Brewer chris Christie

Mike Pence and John Kasich did expand

Medicaid in their states despite being

firm opponents of Obamacare I don't

support Obamacare I want to repeal it

that I did expand Medicaid because I was

able to bring Ohio money back home to

treat the mentally ill the drug addicted

and to help the working poor get health

care because you opposed Obamacare

doesn't mean when you have an

opportunity to bring these 14 billion

dollars of Ohio money back to Ohio

that's not Obamacare that's Medicaid you

know what good for him good for him

although it's a bit weird when accepting

billions of dollars to give health care

to poor people is somehow a brave and

noble stand when all Kasich technically

did was see a dump truck full of money

backing into his driveway and just not

say stop

all of which brings us back to Tuesday's

elections because in these three states

they could determine the fate of

Medicaid expansion so let's start with

Mississippi there incumbent governor

phil Bryant opposes the expansion the

good news is his opponent has promised

if elected he'll expand it the bad news

is his opponent is this guy political

experts in Mississippi were stumped when

the long-haul trucker who ran no

campaign to speak of and who was

essentially unknown outside his own home

was elected as the Democratic nominee to

be governor

spent how much in this race maybe 50 $60

50 $60 in the whole campaign no signs in

the yard no bumper stickers no anything

Gray's run for the nomination was so

low-key he forgot to mention it to his

own mother I called him an active Robert

you burn it for governor and I was like

now he would have told us and she's like

no it's him holy girl there is a

difference between running a low-key

campaign and not having name recognition

within your own family and if you're

wondering how on earth he got that

nomination well some people have a

theory some think it's simply because

Gray's name was the first on the ballot

others say it's because he has a

traditional man's name he is a male and

this is Mississippi oh he is a male and

this is Mississippi it's depressing when

that's all you have to say and everyone

understands it was an attractive goat

and this is West Virginia I get it I get

it I don't need any more details we're

on the same page it's pretty clear at

this point Robert gray is not going to

be the next governor of Mississippi so

let's move on to Virginia where the

obstacle to Medicaid expansion is their

state legislature for anything to happen

Democrats would first have to gain two

senate seats and one of the Senate's

leading opponents of expansion is dick

black whose name yes

sounds like a category heading in an

adult bookstore but believe me he's

considerably less fun than his name

suggests for instance he won't sent a

thank you letter to Bashar al Assad

commending him for his extraordinary

gallantry in his war against terrorists

a letter Assad posted to his face

page which I'd say was the worst thing

he'd ever posted on social media if it

weren't for this genuine Instagram photo

of his windshield on a rainy day which

is sad whassat actually tagged hashtag

rain

hashtag morning hashtag photo of the day

hashtag best of the day hashtag

instigate hashtag Syrian presence and

since he Assad abuses hashtags almost as

much as he abuses the Syrian people and

by the way Bashar al-assad is not alone

in getting surprising envelopes from

dick black years ago when he was in the

House of Delegates and sponsoring an

anti-abortion measure he left envelopes

on Senators desks with little plastic

pink fetuses inside

well that is revolting it almost makes

you mr. dick black who was running in

Virginia was legendary according this

dick black I'm sure he could find a

great campaign song from his actual

album a taste of dick black a taste of

dick black now is that relevant to what

we were talking about absolutely not but

you cannot deny it's a nice palate

cleanser after you just heard the phrase

plastic fetuses but perhaps the most

striking election this year is in

Kentucky where they did expand Medicaid

and by all accounts it has worked

brilliantly Kentucky has seen the

nation's steepest drop in the rate of

uninsured residents only an idiot would

try to undo that which brings me to

gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin he

has been accused of wanting to end the

expansion and kick people off Medicaid

something he denies you're hearing

things that I'm supposedly saying which

in fact I've never said I've never said

I'm gonna kick people off of Medicaid it

all right okay fine you never said that

well I presume that means that this

footage does not exist the fact that we

have one out of four people in this

state on Medicaid is unsustainable it's

unaffordable the fewer governor you

would undo his executive order to fan

Medicaid absolutely no question about I

would reverse that immediately the only

rational explanation is that Matt Bevin

has cloned himself and his clone bats

mevin is even stupider than he is and

what what makes his opposition to

government assistance is especially hard

to take is that he heads up a family

bail making business whose connecticut

factory sadly burned down a few years

ago so what did this staunch small

government free-market advocate do owner

Matthew Bevin vows to rebuild and he may

be getting some help senator Blumenthal

vows to explore EPA grants for clean up

possible small business loans and

potential resources from FEMA and other

federal agencies your kind offer to

basically form Team Belltown is critical

now to be fair team Belltown did not

receive federal assistance Bevin did

however get a hundred thousand dollar

state grant to reopen his Factory

so if Matt Bevin ends up winning I

presume he'll give you health care as

long as you cover yourself in bells and

set yourself on fire but the real irony

here is that Bevin did not have

insurance to cover the fire because he

claimed no company would insure the

buildings for a price that made sense

that's right because the cost of

insurance was too high he needed to turn

to the government for help and quite

frankly Matt Bevin that should ring a

bell

and yet and

after broke now his race is considered a

toss-up

he could win just like a dick black

could win and just like Robert gray

definitely once so on Tuesday even if

you don't live in a state holding an

election spare a thought for the people

who do because the results may

ultimately affect the health of half a

million people and of course one

ridiculous looking animal

jobs you know the thing every kid gets

asked about I want to be I want to be a

lawyer lawyer highway pilot patty and a

dad a poly appraiser that I want to be

an artist that goes around painting

walls I the feedback doctor moving

around me doctor Oh

a mermaid doctor I mean sure everyone

wants to be a mermaid doctor until that

is you have to do your first mermaid

colonoscopy two things that you know

about a mermaids are soul kid and you

may as well learn them now one no matter

where you're picturing it that's not

where it is and to no one comes out the

same person they went in a part of you

dies in there and you'll spend the rest

of your life trying to get it back

anyway jobs were a major theme in Donald

Trump's presidential campaign along with

of course walls

taco bowls allegations of sexual assault

and admissions of sexual assaults but

the Trump's primary focus as candidate

and president has been on jobs

specifically who was stealing them

whether it's China or Japan or Mexico

they're all taking our jobs

now Vietnam that's the new one they are

taking our jobs the jobs are being taken

by India our jobs were stolen away and

shipped far away to other countries some

of which you've never even heard of yes

all jobs are being stolen by countries

you've never even heard of although try

to remember that this is coming from the

man who reportedly referred to Nepal and

Bhutan as nipple and butter so for truck

countries you've never heard of could

just mean bulgy areola

that's not for dogs hotel that one

basically stealing your jobs look some

manufacturing jobs are gone because they

went overseas but Trump is completely

ignoring another major factor behind job

losses Automation its impact has been

massive you wouldn't know it from how

Trump talks but our manufacturing sector

now produces twice as much as it did in

1984 but we produce it with one-third

fewer workers the point is many of those

jobs aren't being stolen they are

disappearing because machines are now

doing them and thanks to advances in AI

and robotics there are concerns that

this sort of job loss could accelerate

in fact a few years back some people got

very concerned when an Oxford University

study came out with a startling number

an Oxford University study says that up

to half of all jobs in the US are at

risk to automation they new study which

suggests many of us may lose our jobs

because of robots a robo is probably

going to take your job that's according

to a new Oxford University study but

that's close to 50% of the workforce

being completely eliminated as in no

more jobs for them Wow

50% of all our jobs will be gone that is

terrifying for you luckily a robot could

never be a late-night host it make basic

mistakes like say devoting 90 seconds of

airtime to a list of dumb names Trump

might have for other countries

how weird would that be it's called

pacing robots look it up you don't do a

massive list of names before you've

introduced the thesis of your piece

anyway the thesis of this piece is that

what people often talk about automation

in apocalyptic terms the truth is

everything about it is more complicated

than you think

including that half your jobs will be

gone Oxford study so tonight let's talk

about automation let's begin with the

fact that while it's often presented as

a scary new problem

it's neither entirely scary nor entirely

new from the Industrial Revolution

through the rise of mass production

automation has transformed our society

in ways people have marveled at

sometimes in less than ideal language

power and the highly important

standardization of parts and mass

production with its assembly lines have

created more mechanical slaves for man

mechanical slaves in the machine tool

industry created by man to create more

mechanical slaves the average man in the

United States today is said to have at

his beck and call 20 my chemical slave

slave slave slaves oh how I have missed

them yes

mechanical slaves if you close your eyes

you can forget that they're mechanical

and look there is no doubt mechanical

slaves or machines as a normal person

might describe them have had hugely

beneficial effects they've made goods

cheaper and jobs easier and sometimes

safer take this man he runs a logging

company is different and he's developing

machines to felled trees which would put

his own son out of a job but he's doing

it for a pretty compelling reason if you

have a man on a chainsaw falling trees

they're eventually going to get hurt

logging has the highest death rate of

any American occupation for its size

logging kills people at a higher rate

than the military I've come to the

belief it the only way I can ensure the

safety of my peoples not have them there

the best way not to kill a hand cutters

not half of them he's right the best way

not to kill a hand cutter is not to have

one which presumably means the best way

to kill a hand cutter is to have one so

if you are trying to murder a lumberjack

we best just to hire him and wait also

also don't do it don't do it but if you

really want to that would be how to go

about it which you shouldn't yeah

absolutely shouldn't despite the fact

I've just given you a perfect blueprint

for how to get away with it but again I

want to make this absolutely clear

nobody out there should murder a

lumberjack you just wait for them to die

in an accident is that it's the perfect

crime but the truth is from employer's

point of view the big selling point for

automation is that it increases

productivity and it maximizes profits

and for displaced workers that has

caused immense pain throughout history

and not just in factories for instance

in the 90s as voice recognition

technology improved phone company

operators were rightly worried for their

jobs my first thought was uh-oh here

comes trouble

this is gonna get my job for sure the

first thing I thought about is that this

is gonna be a robot they're not gonna

need as many operators I'm about to lose

my job now talk to some friends of mine

back where I came from from shirt board

in the office and the rumors were

running rampant over there you know like

oh my gosh they're testing this machine

and it's gonna do away with their job

and they're shutting you know we heard

you out they were shutting down y'all's

office and going completely to machines

okay first of all I don't know this

isn't the point here but what the

is going on in Shreveport

Lisa Lee here is your friend and you're

all hey Lisa

you're gonna get fired you three

ports go

you deserve friends who lift you up not

tear you down take a step back and

remember how far you have come

you don't need Shreveport Shreveport

needs you now you pick yourself up and

you show the world what Lisa Lee is

really made of

but when you see this story through the

eyes of worried employees you can

understand the deep-seated human urge

that many of us have to see robots come

to half whether we're joyously

retweeting this photo captioned our DC

office building got a security robot it

drowned itself or just attacking any

robot foolish enough to trust us the

idea was to see how people would

interact with a talking solar powered

robot as it hitched across America on

its own tracked by a GPS on Saturday the

robot was found in Philadelphia the City

of Brotherly Love resting in pieces late

today video surfaced of the attack but

the robots creators are not out for

revenge

yeah you're wrong about that it has

absolutely everything to do with

Philadelphia this is a city with a

chronic police horse punching problem

sending a hitchhiking robot into

Philadelphia it's not unlike sending a

beautiful belt symbolizing freedom into

Philadelphia there is no way it's going

to remain in one piece and there's a

nonzero chance that someone is going to

try and it so so

at this point you may be thinking well

whatever its advantages

Automation throws a lot of people out of

work right well yes but again it is

complicated and the picture often gets

distorted

remember that report from earlier the

one that led to claims that half of our

jobs were going away there are real

concerns about its methodology and other

studies have come up with much lower

numbers but even more importantly it

didn't claim half of jobs would be gone

it suggested some jobs were in the

high-risk category for being automated

and that is actually a very different

thing because a job automated is not

necessarily a job lost frequently

machines don't replace jobs so much as

tasks a good example of this concerns

ATMs it is hard to imagine a time now

that they weren't around but but when

they became common in the 1980s bank

tellers were afraid of them stealing

their jobs of course customers were

sometimes afraid of them for very

different reasons there's a herd yeah

ignoring the old adage never bite the

hand that feeds you the Bank of America

versateller did just that snap down to

Paul's hand while he was trying to

transact business with it that man died

that's ridiculous no he died two years

later when he got stuck inside a claw

machine that's a fact

that's a fact what is that fact based on

nothing other than my total conviction

that it's true but but while ATMs did

eat the occasional customer fears of job

losses turned out to be completely

overblown because bank teller employment

actually increased over the next thirty

years what happened was ATMs took over

the job of dispensing cash and tellers

were then freed up to do sales or other

work their jobs didn't go they changed

and when automation does lead to job

loss in certain sectors historically it

also actually created jobs as these

economists from MIT explains let's do

the following thought exercise

it's a year nineteen hundred and forty

percent of all employment is in

agriculture right and so some twerpy

economists from MIT

he teleports back in time and says a

hundred years from now only two percent

of people will be working in agriculture

what do you think the other 38% of

people are gonna do well I wouldn't know

you would say Oh search engine

optimization you know health and

wellness software and mobile devices

most of what we do

barely existed exactly that's twerpy

economist is right 50 years from now

people will be doing jobs that we can't

imagine right now like crypto baker or

snail rehydrate err or investment

harpist I don't know the point is you

can't imagine them so we get rid of some

jobs but we get new ones

so that's even-steven right well not

necessarily because the new jobs

automation creates won't necessarily pay

the same as the ones it takes away and

it might not be easy for displaced

workers to transition into them for

instance right now our economy is

creating lots of jobs in the tech sector

at the same time we have three and a

half million truckers possibly facing

unemployment due to driverless

technology now in an ideal world those

truckers could seamlessly move into

high-tech jobs but as this man explains

it's just not that easy if the average

age is 55 these guys going to be

computer programmers they didn't finish

high school I doubt it

of course I mean but maybe some 55

year-old truck drivers will become web

designers but if you think all of them

will

it might be worth remembering that time

your father accidentally typed his

Google search into Facebook and then

tried to cover it up by putting whiteout

on the computer so so the big question

here is how do you harness what is good

about automation while minimizing the

damage to those hurt by it well the best

thing would be if America were in the

hands of someone nimble and

forward-thinking and unfortunately that

brings us back to this guy and he has

not demonstrated much of a grasp on this

issue just look what happens with the

company called carrier you may remember

right after the election Trump with the

aid of a massive tax break convinced the

CEO of carriers parent company Greg

Hayes not to move one of their factories

to Mexico he made a big deal out of

saving those jobs and he was excited

about what was coming next they're going

to spend so much money on renovating

this plant and I said Greg say that

number you know he said

ten million weld the minimum number 16

it's going to be in my opinion a lot

more than that he said well I'd rather

say the lower number see I'd rather have

them say the higher number so I won't

say okay it's just a difference in

philosophy do you agree

both are okay but difference in

philosophy but they're gonna spend more

than 60 they could spend a lot of money

on the plan that's it's a difference in

philosophy you see I want to lie

he doesn't want to like both or okay I'm

still gonna lie to you I'm just gonna do

it vaguely for Greg this lies for you

Greg Greg seem to spend way more than 16

million dollars on the plants but here's

the thing about that 16 million dollars

it wasn't actually good news for the

workers as Greg Hayes made clear just a

few days later we're gonna make a 16

million dollar investment in that

Factory in Indianapolis to automate to

drive the cost down so that we can

continue to be competitive but that

ultimately means is there will be fewer

jobs oh great work mr. president so

basically Kerry workers are still going

to lose their jobs it's just the

government now helped us for some reason

pay for the robots that will replace

them that is the classic Trump deal

making that you can read all about in

his best-selling book the art of saying

whatever and letting someone else a

different person or hey maybe even a

robot deal with the consequences is that

a good title why not it's a moot point

because it's 11:45 a.m. which is

basically noon so that's lunch

Automation honestly hasn't gotten much

better since because for someone who

claims that he cares so much about the

American worker he's done almost nothing

to help people displaced by automation

and there is frankly plenty that he

could be doing one set of proposals

includes funding retraining ideally

retraining that he's directly tailored

to available jobs in your area that

seems like a sensible idea as does

trying to help older workers who may end

up having to take a new job with a lower

salary through things like wage

insurance or an expanded Earned Income

Tax Credit now all of that will cost

money and quite a lot of it

so Trump will probably revert to his

preferred solution blaming China Vietnam

and other countries you've probably

never even heard of so in the meantime

we need to start preparing younger

workers for the job market that they're

about to enter because the pace of

technological change is now so rapid

some experts suggest that we might need

to start rethinking our basic

of a career the majority of people will

end up having an episodic career it's

great to ask kids for example what do

you want to be when you grow up but one

thing that might be added to that

question is what five things do you want

to be when you grow up she's right about

that and that means that the girl from

before who said mermaid doctor may need

to come up with some backup plans

partly because that job may be partially

automated in the future and partly

because let's be honest rising ocean

temperatures are gonna kill all the

mermaids itself the fact they're going

to be boiled alive and look look I've

thrown a lot of complication at you

tonight but the one thing we know for

sure is automation is not going to stop

and some people are going to lose their

job so we should help those that do and

be preparing the next generation for the

possibility that they may need to be

more flexible in their career plans what

do you want to be when you grow up I

want to be an inventor I want to be a

musician under a person who takes people

on too far

then I look like a fashion designer so

are you worried about robots taking over

certain jobs no okay you might need to

be aware of that long-term tell me what

you name some jobs and I will tell you

whether I think a robot could do it or

not okay policeman a robot could do that

that's literally with the plot of

Robocop robots could definitely do that

Zoe sorry killer robot get work yeah

robot can get wet that's not a job but

yes or a robot and it works fine robot

with a hose right

drama Oh a robot could definitely do the

drums they'd be probably really bad at

basketball robots are actually

incredible at basketball

look at this I'm gonna Google robot

drummer right now okay

I just put robot D and it autocorrected

you're definitely faster than a robot

mm-hmm here's the thing you're

definitely not Lauren do you think a

robot can do my job in the future I

would say we take a big story and we try

and inject it with as much nuance as we

can so we really try and get a deep dive

into complicated issues and and then I

present our work you know to the

audience at the end of the week you

think robot could do that well what can

I do what can you do that is actually a

good question you can do a series of non

routine tasks that require social

intelligence complex critical thinking

and creative problem solving okay okay

okay can you repeat that back to me I

want to do a series of non routine tasks

I like to do a series of mountain parks

tasks tasks I feel like you're doing a

British accent players only that require

social intelligence social intelligence

complex critical thinking and creative

problem solving and creative problem

solving and creative problem solving

that's what you got to do in the future

Zoe yeah okay is that a deal we did it

I like don't know what it means

[Applause]

you

our main story tonight concerns the past

week's terrible events in Missouri an

officer shot an 18 year-old man outside

an apartment complex in Ferguson

Missouri it is unclear at this hour what

led to the shooting but witnesses say

the teenager was unarmed angry

confrontations between protesters and

police in riot gear the same anger and

outrage that exploded into a chaotic

night of looting and violence this whole

story is depressingly familiar and there

are so many unanswered questions

regarding why an officer would shoot an

unarmed teenager what is absolutely

clear is that the police have handled

everything since then terribly and the

tone-deafness

began with this asked how many times

Brown was shot st. Louis County Police

Chief Jon Belmar said it was more than

just a couple but I don't think it was

many more than that just just think

about what he's saying there not much

more than more than twice don't you try

and minimize this anymore

look listen everyone only very many more

than one bullet was fired so everybody

calm down shall we

the police then refused four days to

release the name of the officer involved

and when they eventually did they

packaged it with a DVD extra that no one

wanted at the same time they released

video of Michael Brown allegedly

carrying out a store robbery minutes

before he was shot and killed and that

has sparked new outrage yeah of course

it has because it's irrelevant

if the police wanted to distract

everyone with a video that has

absolutely nothing to do with Michael

Brown shooting they should have just

released Ghostbusters instead it's

exactly as relevant to everything that

happened afterwards but but the more the

week went on the more you got the sense

that those in charge in Ferguson don't

have the best sense of how their

community feels just listen to the mayor

we've never seen this kind of violence

we've never seen this kind of

frustration or tension between the races

I've always been proud to say that to

people

I know we've always gotten along and I

know our communities still gets along

well Oh we're absolutely famous for it

presumably that is why I the mayor of

Ferguson I'm currently on national

television presumably we're

talking about how well our town is

getting along right now and always has

the thing is if you ask around in

Ferguson you get a slightly different

story the Carson resume is frequently

it's all through the day is all to the

night then they not beating us

physically they doing it verbally here's

the thing the mayor doesn't understand

that as a general rule not one should

ever be allowed to say there is no

history of racial tension here because

that sentence has never been true

anywhere on earth there is tension

between emperor penguins and gentle

penguins cute Gentoo penguins flapping

over here stealing our fish not you

chinstrap penguins you're cool you

you've got you got as a good at math so

so which one of these two men is right

about what life as a young

african-american in Ferguson is like

well too much of that let's look at the

police force what does it look like in a

town which is about two-thirds

african-american what does the makeup of

your police force the number and how

many of them are white I just want

clarification of that I mean they keep

saying three of our three are

african-american but that actually

believe it's five there was six but one

left fairly recently we also have a

Hispanic and two Asian Pacific Islanders

exactly it doesn't stop bad guys we got

a couple of white guys who occasionally

listen to hip-hop music I mean

Macklemore sure but still

also also we have six Norwegian

Americans who really enjoyed the Lion

King on Broadway so it's like it's more

diverse than it seems but despite the

presence of both of the Pacific

Islanders and of course the Hispanic

let's not forget him the Ferguson Police

do seem to target minorities 86% of

police stops are african-americans 92%

of police searches nearly 93% of arrests

even though they stopped more blacks

more White's had contraband yeah of

course more White's had contraband they

knew that if you look like this you

don't get stopped if you are white in

Ferguson you would need to be snorting

cocaine directly off your dashboards to

get stopped by the police whereas if

you're an african-american in Ferguson

like say Henry Davis here you may have a

slightly different experience because

while in custody in the Ferguson Jail in

2009 officers grabbed him and pushed him

and struck him multiple times they say

they were provoked although oddly there

is no video of this incident despite the

fact that jail is equipped with video

cameras and what is known though at this

point is that he was later charged with

four counts of destruction of city

property for bleeding on their uniforms

and I've got to say he was lucky that he

wasn't eating spaghetti at the time of

his beating well they would have

upgraded that charge to a felony and

that is just a local police the County

police also have had their share of

problems a st. Louis County police

lieutenant is without a job tonight he

was fired for allegedly ordering patrol

officers to arrest black people shopping

in South County oh it wasn't just that

he ordered racial profiling it was how

he allegedly did it with his colleagues

claiming that he said things like let's

have a black day and let's make the jail

cells more colorful now let's be fair

let's be fair here let's have a black

day is an awesome thing to say if you

are shaft

and let's make the jail cells more

colorful is entirely appropriate if

you're an interior designer with a

folder full of paint swatches however if

you're a white police officer it's not

ideal to say either of those which is

not to say that all cops are bad they

are clearly not also the people of

Ferguson wants and need an effective

police force but perhaps their

relationship was best summed up by this

photo from earlier this week

not just ludicrously aggressive police

facing off against an unarmed man but

also the fact that someone has clearly

written to the police on the postbox

something something apparently CNN did

not notice when they were using this

photo during all of their coverage now

you might also notice in that photo that

the police are troublingly dressed like

they're about to launch an assault on

Fallujah well it turns out that that is

no coincidence since 1996 in response to

the war on drugs a Department of Defense

transferred 4.3 billion dollars in

military equipment to local and state

police after 9/11 the Department of

Homeland Security made additional

equipment available to local law

enforcement through federal funds for

terrorism prevention that's right and

this has happened on such a scale that

it enabled small towns like Keene New

Hampshire to apply for a Bearcat a

military-grade armored personnel truck

which they needed because as their

application argued the terrorism threat

is far-reaching and often unforeseen and

cited as a possible target their annual

Pumpkin Festival

specifically this pumpkin festival which

is now being protected by vixx good luck

easily outmaneuvering that teenagers

with baseball bats and if you're

wondering what it feels like to have a 9

resistant vehicle on the streets of your

town I give you a YouTube video of two

dudes from Saginaw Michigan holy

dude super armor dude doesn't anybody

seem in there dude you can't even see

them looks cool dude they go look up big

these tires are compared are it's taller

than its dude to be fair to be fair that

is exactly how they reacted when a

Chipotle first opened there but the

point is listen carefully as one of them

suddenly realizes something

[Music]

here's the thing no it hasn't got that

bad because unless you live in downtown

Kabul there is no practical need for

anything like that in your town just ask

the people that it came from the army

itself actually in a newsletter a few

months ago recommended against using em

raps even at US military bases you know

on paved streets in the United States

they're actually unsafe they tear up the

streets they have a high rollover

potential exactly the only vehicle that

should be tearing up the streets of

Saginaw is Chad souped up Honda Civic

chorus circuited the police are not

soldiers some why in this photo from

Ferguson are they wearing camo

they are northwest of st. Louis not

northwest of the Amazon if they want to

blend in with their surroundings they

should be dressed as a dollar store

where their guns are pointed if you were

actually in the military you would know

that you are not supposed to do that on

the military were trained on something

called escalation of force which

basically means the only time that

you're really going to point a weapon

directly at someone is when you're ready

to pull the trigger and instead of that

we've seen in Ferguson that police are

just wandering around with their weapons

up at all times pointing them at people

that obviously didn't pose a threat well

what they don't currently pose a threat

but you know it's really all about what

they might do now they could for

instance during the police be given a

gun they're not trained to use properly

and then wander around pointing it at

people that would be terrifying

the points at the pointer is 0.8 if you

are a cop in the United States you

should dress for the job you have not

the job you want because if you have all

this equipment it's going to go to your

head look at Doraville Georgia

population 8,500 the police there got a

tank a while back and up until a few

days ago this video was on the front

page of their website

[Applause]

the name of that song is and this is

true die die and it was a

good choice because believe me that

video does not pair well with Simon &

Garfunkel now that video was just a

training exercise but the problem is

police departments don't just use this

stuff for training thanks in part to

this kind of access to military hardware

there has been a massive rise in both

the number and the use of Police

Department's SWAT teams the number of

SWAT raids have gone up by fourteen

hundred percent since the 1980s an

estimated 50,000 now take place every

year

just keep that clip in mind when I tell

you that 79 percent of SWAT deployments

are now for executing search warrants

and most of those were for drug

investigations so yes if you are getting

high in your dorm room right now you are

not paranoid there is a SWAT team

outside and they are coming to get you

all of which all of which brings us back

to this week and to Ferguson so how do

you improve things there well you could

demilitarize the police force to stop

things looking like this but that would

just change the optics the substance of

the problem would still be there as was

embodied by a police officer on the

streets of Ferguson this week who was

dressed entirely normally the phrase

bring it you animals is barely

acceptable during a zoo escape it's not

even acceptable in the restaurant in

Mary Poppins where penguins are waiters

brilliant you've in animal like don't

treat them like that that they'll piss

on your suit that they'll pissing

yourself and you'll deserve it that kind

of statement betrays an inability to see

the citizens of Ferguson as individuals

and instead treats them as a threatening

whole and that is a top-down problem

because last night this is how the

governor of Missouri decided to try and

rebuild trust between the police and the

community

I signed in order to clearing a state of

emergency an Ori implementation of a

curfew and he apparent in the impact and

a curfew in the impacted area furthest

in a perfect so you took a community

tired of being treated as criminals and

imprisoned them all in their own houses

for a night and in doing so employed the

tone of a pissed-off vice-principal

trying to restore order at an assembly

if we're going to achieve justice

we must first have and maintain peace

this is a test the eyes of the euro are

watching that is profoundly patronizing

look let's see if you can all remain

quiet for 20 minutes and then we'll see

if you can all go and play outside if

even the governor can't distinguish

between the good and the bad elements of

the community and decided to punish

everyone equally then that should go

both ways I know the police love their

ridiculous unnecessary military

equipment so here's another patronizing

test let's take it all away from them

and if they can make it through a whole

month without killing a single unarmed

black man then and only then can they

get their toys back

[Applause]

the 2016 election or as it's commonly

known a horrifying glimpse at Satan's

Pinterest boards 2016 this week was the

Democratic National Convention and after

the bizarre Republican circus that

preceded it all they really had to do

was not appear like a complete disaster

and yet somehow

good evening their party's chairman off

the program an apparent Russian email

hack and that will revolt among Bernie

Sanders supporters welcome to day one of

the Democratic National Convention that

was day one day one

the DNC got off to the roughest start

that I've seen since Fox fives 2011

coverage of the San Diego Boat Show good

morning everybody I'm hanging out with

my friend John Fox 5 Morning News starts

look over there and it starts right now

[Applause]

that is basically what happened on day 1

of the DNC in a nutshell because because

before debbie Wasserman Schultz could

even gavel in the convention a leaked

email scandal had forced her to resign

and Bernie Sanders supporters gave her a

rough reception when she met with her

own States delegation I'm sorry

disruptive borderline unhinged and

getting ready to vote that is literally

the only Florida that we know the only

way that could be anymore Florida is if

one of the Bernie delegates was an aging

heavily armed racist alligator now

luckily for the Democrats things

gradually got back on track thanks to a

series of stirring speeches beginning

with the first lady today I wake up

every morning in a house that was built

by slaves

and and I watched my daughter's too

beautiful intelligent black young women

playing with their dogs on the White

House lawn

now whatever your party affiliation that

is a truly moving speech the only thing

I would say to the audience is maybe

don't start your round of applause

directly following the phrase built by

slaves oh they did a lovely job they had

to they had to do a good job they they

had to that's why

lovely now the next day it was Bill

Clinton's turn to fire up the crowd

retelling his relationship with Hillary

seemingly in real time and then

Wednesday on Wednesday Joe Biden spoke

assuming the role of America's

motivational cattle-prod

we are America second to none and we own

the finish line don't forget it god

bless you all

may God protect our troops

come on once he has left the White House

Biden is going to be the most inspiring

soul cycle instructor ever come on

bundle you own the finish line come on

don't you like the way Biden was

actually the warm-up man for the

president who like many speakers

throughout the week occasionally lapsed

into a tone of actual disbelief at what

America might be considering doing this

election people outside of the United

States do not understand what's going on

in this election

they really don't that's actually true

the rest of the world does not

understand Trump's candidacy any more

than they understand the menu at Guy

Fieri's American kitchen this a donkey

saucer is it made from actual donkey why

do you do this to yourself

but the emotional highlight of the

convention was undoubtedly a speech by

Kaiser comm a lawyer immigrant and

father of a fallen Muslim American

soldier Donald Trump you're asking

Americans to trust you with their future

let me ask you have you even read the

United States Constitution

I will

I will gladly lend you

oh that is an American founding

document being inspirationally used as a

middle finger and it wasn't even the

most devastating part of mr. Karnes

speech have you ever been to Arlington

Cemetery go look at the graves of brave

Patriots who died defending United

States of America you will see all

faiths genders and ethnicities you have

sacrificed nothing Wow

that engendered in me a level of emotion

that I did not think was possible after

16 months of this depressing campaign

and 39 years on earth as a British

person and yet the true theories however

incredible the surrogate speeches are

conventions are really judged by the

performances of the two people on the

party's ticket so how did they fare well

let's start with Tim Kaine a human

sweater vest he's he's basically the

portrait of a vice president that came

with the frame his speech his speech is

exactly as boring as you would expect

with the exception of his almost

impressively bad Trump impression it's

going to be great believe me

we're gonna build a wall and make Mexico

pay for it believe me we're gonna

destroy Isis so fast believe me what the

was that that doesn't sound like

him at all how is this man gonna win an

election if he couldn't even win a game

of cranium is it Jackie Gleason Brad

Garrett kicked him just mold whoever it

is out of clay we have no chance here

and as for Hillary Clinton on the night

of her historic nomination she stood

before the nation in full pitbull

cosplay she had a genuinely stupid

amount of balloons dropped on her head

and in between delivered a speech

focusing on the actual job requirements

of being president I sweat the details

of policy whether we're talking about

the exact level of lead and the drinking

water in Flint Michigan the number of

mental health facilities in Iowa or the

cost of your prescription drugs because

it's not just a detail if it's your kid

if it's your family it's a big deal it

was a kind of interesting approach

instead of soaring rhetoric the bulk of

her speech was basically I'm gonna

micromanage the out of this office

I'm gonna get granular as now drop

the balloons and I will count them all

I'm all about the details it was

definitely a restrained speech to close

a convention especially when you compare

it to the week before when Donald Trump

essentially opened his mouth and exhaled

a swarm of locusts but now that both

conventions are behind us maybe we

should try and take stock of what they

have taught us about the current state

of our two political parties the DNC

showed the Democrats to be a coalition

of constantly squabbling if

fundamentally like-minded Katy Perry

fans and as for the RNC it showed that

the Republican Party doesn't seem to

currently exist because to all intents

and purposes we didn't really get a

Republican convention this year

sure there was a cleveland-based

gathering of delegates featuring all of

Donald Trump's favorite family members

and Tiffani and celebrities whose most

notable upcoming projects include the

Emmy Awards in memoriam reel probably

but but almost everything that you would

expect from a GOP convention was absent

many prominent Republicans chose to skip

it as did both living Republican former

presidents and for the party of Reagan

the tongue was unusually and

relentlessly negative not only have our

citizens endured domestic disaster but

they've lived through one international

humiliation after another one after

another what is he even talking about

only one major international humiliation

from recent history comes to mind and

it's the ones standing behind that

podium wide open to pick up the mantle

of people who actually like living here

don't let anyone ever tell you that this

country isn't great that somehow we need

to make it bring it again because this

right now is the greatest country on

Earth

yes the greatest country on Earth you

hear that Denmark

you got Ilsa yeah I don't care what the

world's happiness index says Michelle

Obama told me that we're number one and

her arms make me feel safe

so unusually the DNC felt like the more

patriotic occasion it featured America's

greatest actress dressed up like a

plastic tablecloth from the 4th of July

and General John Allen's screaming at

people to our enemies we will pursue you

as only America can you will fear us and

to Isis and others we will defeat you

who who were you shouting at Isis is not

watching the DNC they're watching

Braxton Family Values

it's Thursday fool but but that is think

about it that is a retired four-star

Marine general threatening vaguely

defined enemies while a crowd wave signs

reading USA that is not something you

expect to see and a Democratic

convention not because Democrats aren't

patriotic but because Republicans have

always done that louder and longer this

whole two weeks felt topsy-turvy it's

frankly no wonder that commentators felt

a little confused but if you were a

Martian and you came down and looked at

these two conventions and somebody asked

you which of the two parties is the most

overtly patriotic yeah you would say the

Democratic Party okay but if you were a

Martian who landed on Earth and someone

asked you which party seemed more

patriotic you would probably say wait

that's your question

I'm literally an alien is that nothing

else you want to ask me how was your

trip for example or what was tilda

swinton like as a kid usually I'm at

like usually people's first question for

me is why is your penis made of pure

glowing white light but the reason the

Republican Party essentially forgot to

celebrate America this year might be

because they were too busy celebrating

Donald Trump's claims that he would fix

whatever Donald Trump thinks is wrong

with America nobody knows the system

better than me

[Applause]

which is why I alone can fix it when I

take the oath of office next year I will

restore law and order to our country

I am your voice now now I am your voice

is actually a fair claim he does speak

for some people although you were kind

of hope that they would then react the

way most people do when they hear their

own voice which is to say oh I

don't actually sound like that do I

that is King a horrified the RNC taught

us that a party which used to be

organized around a set of shared

principles is currently organized around

one man and given that that is the case

his judgment is pretty much the only

thing that is important when considering

who to vote for in November so to that

end I would like to show you something

he said recently and before I do he has

clearly said countless awful things

throughout this campaign any of which

would disqualify any other candidate

just this week he declined yet again to

release his tax returns lies about

getting a letter from the NFL agreeing

with him that the debate shouldn't clash

with football games called Angela Merkel

and moron employed that Brazil brought

the Zika virus on themselves and

encouraged a foreign powers hack of his

political rival now two of those didn't

happen but you're not sure which two and

that's kind of the point isn't it

because Trump hasn't said one crazy

thing he said thousands of crazy things

each of which blunts the effect of the

others it's the bed of dales principle

if you step on one nail it hurts you if

you step on a thousand nails no single

one stands out and you're fine that is

how Donald Trump has managed to say

pretty much anything in this campaign

seemingly without consequences and yet

even with that caveat his response when

asked about that speech from Kizza Khan

stands out I saw him he was you know

very emotional and probably look like a

nice guy to me his wife

if you look at his wife she was standing

there she had nothing to say she

probably maybe she wasn't allowed to

have anything to say you tell me but

plenty of people have written that she

she was extremely quiet and it looked

like she had nothing to say okay for a

start his wife has explained that she

chose not to speak because she gets too

upset when she sees images of her dead

son's face you asshole but I'm sorry I'm

sorry

please continue he said you have

sacrificed nothing and no one

well that sounds who wrote that did

Hilary's scriptwriters write it how

would you answer that father what

sacrifice have you made for your country

I think I made a lot of sacrifices I

worked very very hard I've created

thousands and thousands of jobs tens of

thousands of jobs built great structures

I've done I've had I've had tremendous

success I think those are sacrifices oh

sure I think they're sacrifices no no

absolutely not

they are self-serving half-truths from a

self-serving half man who has somehow

convinced half the country that

sacrifice is the same thing as success

honestly the main takeaway from these

two weeks is that incredibly we may be

on the brink of electing such a damaged

sociopathic narcissist that the simple

presidential duty of comforting the

families of fallen soldiers may actually

be beyond his capabilities and I

genuinely did not think that that was a

part of the job that someone could be

bad at and now this and finally this

week some more highlights from the

Democratic National Convention

to hell with Trump's American Nightmare

we believe in the American dream

the right-wing has thrown everything at

Hillary not only the kitchen sink

not only the stove but the refrigerator

and the toaster stood for the macro

issues and those macaroni and cheese

issues put down your pokemons go for

just a second her name and Donald Trump

do our dirty dozen list dirty dangerous

denying Donald shade boy and it's true I

haven't really got the bolo tie look to

catch on she was the first person to

call me when my second child was born I

heard no it says about my family but

Hillary on oh she loves HGTV and she can

devour buffalo wings whether on a car

plane or train

[Applause]

it's healing time it's hope time is

Hildred time it's healing time is hope

time it's hildreth time it

in several times

is home time if his room time is healing

time is her

[Music]

you better listen to me I said she will

stay cold

[Applause]

[Music]

the NRA a group that feels about guns

the way the rest of us feel about

natella a little is good more is better

and you can tell me it's bad for me all

you like but you will pry it from my

cold dead hands now in the wake of the

parklands shooting the NRA has found

themselves in the spotlight once more

however the public pressure this time is

actually starting to take a toll Twitter

users are pressuring companies

affiliated with a gun rights group by

using the hashtag boycott NRA so 15

companies have cut ties with the NRA

after Parkland I think we have a list of

them here some big ones you know Delta

United a Viet hurts basically saying

they're no longer going to provide

discounts to the NRA yes ie this budget

and Hertz will all stop providing

discounts to NRA members which will

presumably come as a huge blow to Jeremy

the one NRA member who was just in it

for the rental cars but the boycott

train hit a bit of a snag when it ran

into one of the NRA lesser-known side

ventures one group that hasn't been

swayed yet big tech companies like Apple

Amazon and Roku you see these companies

streaming services still offer access to

NRA TV the gun lobby groups free online

channel focused on pro-gun content okay

so that is an uncomfortable situation

for Apple and Amazon but it's a

miracle for Roku hurry hurry get in here

someone just called us a big tech

company they said like Amazon and Apple

it's happening Harry

all of the discussion this week of

boycotting NRA TV we thought it might be

worth answering the question what the

is that

because the truth is you may have

actually seen tiny bits of its

programming without even realizing it

like when this video featuring NRA

spokesperson Dana lash went viral just

last year they use their media to

assassinate real news they use their

schools to teach children that their

president is another Hitler the only way

we stop this the only way we save our

country and our freedom is to fight this

violence of Lies with a clenched fist of

truth yes the clenched fist of truth

which if you're looking for it is just a

little past the bent elbow of nonsense

and hiding in the overstuffed pocket of

needlessly aggressive metaphors now if

you miss that one you may have seen

another one that made the rounds during

the Obama administration featuring

country music legends Charlie Daniels to

the Hyatt olace of Iran and every

terrorist you enable listen up you might

have met our fresh-faced flower child

president is we need Ivy League friends

but you have a better America you

haven't been to Heartland

where the people will defend this nation

with their bloody calloused bare hands

you haven't meant to Steelworkers the

hard rock miners or the swamp folks in

Cajun country who can wrestle a

full-grown Gator out of water you

haven't met the hill demons who can

curse you and your future offspring just

for having a picnic in the wrong place

you haven't met the lake dog

he's a dog who lives in a lake for

reasons too complicated to get into at

the present moment and you haven't even

met the Gators down in Cajun country who

tiptoe out of the water at night and

take revenge on the swamp folk while

they sleep thus perpetuating the sick

cycle of swamp folk Gator violence

that's the America I know and I promise

you you're gonna be confused another one

of their promos was passed around online

and you may recognize one of the faces

in it and drinking as many as 12 diet

cokes the Second Amendment is about a

militia and it's the National Rifle

Association we are the press who's under

attack the president is like a child

certain people shouldn't have guns how

stupid do you think we are bless your

heart

[Applause]

[Music]

now don't laugh he's absolutely right

and if NRA members are annoyed with what

I'm saying right now they should do the

exact same thing and smash their

expensive televisions with large

sledgehammers are you listening NRA

members destroy your own property it's a

really good idea and it's honestly the

only way we'll learn now NRA TV produces

a lot of videos like those that are

essentially just trolling for your

attention but their content goes much

much deeper than that as you will see if

you go to their website or if you watch

it on streaming devices like the great

and powerful Roku NRA TV has news

programming and there's honestly not

really much point in our showing you any

of that because it's essentially just

Fox News on a much lower budget what is

what is more surprising is they make

shows lots and lots of shows and they

are so much stranger than you would

think so tonight let's watch some NRA TV

together because it's fascinating

now some shows are pretty similar to

ones that you would see anywhere on TV

with the key difference that there is a

gun involved

for instance they have three different

Antiques Roadshow knock-offs in which

men who look like this guy gets

progressively more and more aroused by

the guns they're holding what's unique

is that it has such flowing lines its

artwork it's a sensuous gun that's the

kind of pistol that when I hold or when

John is holding it gives me shivers the

idea was is that you in town talk both

hammers yes same time that man is duck

Wicklund and I love him but not as much

as he loves guns in fact the only way he

could love them anymore is if instead of

bullets every gun just fired a bunch of

little guns which in turn fired a bunch

of even smaller guns which in turn fired

tiny dog Wicklund living in a state of

sexual ecstasy inside the womb like

paradise of a firearm and while that

show is pretty sedate NRA TV also has

programming for the testosterone-fueled

gun enthusiasts like Media Lab in which

a former Navy SEAL named Dom Rosso

the very important work of reenacting

movies he likes from White House down to

Jack Reacher and here he is reenacting

scenes from the movie heat the main part

of this movie that I wanted to break

down was the fact that they're shooting

moving and communicating and if we get

past the fact that they're robbing a

bank if you're actually in a specific

uniform with specific kit can you shoot

move communicate with that amount of

weight and do down mandrills that's the

key thing here I would love to see a

bank robber I try to use that defense in

court Your Honor I really feel we need

to get past the fact that we were

robbing a bank and instead focus on how

well we were shooting moving and

communicating and the endearing thing

about Dom Rosso is that he shows

reenactments don't always go smoothly

for instance how did his reenactment of

the heat robbery go they make it look

easy the way they're moving there this

Bay has that was run was just hitting at

the back of my knees have taken my legs

out from underneath me definitely

fatigued me my strap broke so I was

holding it like this the entire time

wobbling back and forth even in the

beginning couldn't get a stable shooting

platform and we worked it out had to

lower my center gravity more so the bag

couldn't control me

we definitely proved that they didn't

have any weight in there while they were

shooting move it wow that is genuinely

inspiring because somewhere out there

there's an eight-year-old asshole

watching that show and thinking oh good

being an adult is literally exactly how

I imagined it honestly I could talk

about Dom wrestle all night but before

we move on I have to show you his

inexplicable response to one viewer

submitted question what is your most

treasured possession I would say my art

gave me a cross that was made out of

bone she's like your

great-great-grandfather gave that to me

to pass down to somebody special in the

family but it was actually made out of

human bone and he carved it when he was

a prisoner of war

and that has been passed down on the

family now Mike are you serious I'm like

it just doesn't exist so that's probably

by far the coolest thing they have

well that's a hell of the story verdad

and I just don't know of any better

poster boy for the NRA than someone who

reenacts bank robberies for fun and

whose most treasured possession is a

cross made out of human bones but look

NRA TV isn't all gun bros there's also a

large amount of content aimed explicitly

at women there's even a whole women's

channel featuring shows like armed and

fabulous the NRA is actually making a

big push for women and they are pretty

clear about their motivations women

really have an incredible growth right

now in the NRA they are excited they're

enthusiastic they're there for us and

that's you know if you get the woman you

get the family if you get the woman you

get the family that is a brazenly

transparent statement of your marketing

strategy but to be honest can we just go

back to that room for a second did you

find that room relaxing is that a

soothing space for you

because I would be a little disturbed by

the extended family of gazelles

screaming why at me with their dead

glassy eyes now one of the NRA's female

focus programs love at first shot is

explicitly about getting women more

comfortable with the idea of owning or

firing guns and in one episode they took

a woman who was nervous about firearms

and really threw her in the deep end

they were gonna go straight into rifles

I'm gonna do it with an ar-15 okay I

know you've probably heard about them on

the news yes I hit the target you did

not as scary as I think I was

anticipated exactly it's just a nice

light push happiness yep a light puffs

of happiness it's a little weird to

describe a semi-automatic rifle the way

Bob Ross describes a cloud

but but once love at first shot has

women hooked the upselling begins which

does actually make sense industry

research has shown that women will spend

hundreds of dollars on accessories in

addition to their guns so you can kind

of understand why love at first shot

functions as a kind of QVC for firearms

showcasing products like mag loaders

targets gun cases and handbags okay so

as you see here I've got a couple of

different style options for you there

are a lot of different varieties of

exteriors but a lot of them really have

the same structure in terms of concealed

carries I never would have imagined

these little neat pockets and hidden

closures knowing that you can close it

it does put my mind at ease of that so

it's pretty cool go you don't even need

a gun because people are going to die

when they see that bag and look it's not

just handbags even the gun itself can be

profitably accessorized so yes we do

have a custom line of gun paint for the

ladies out there these mags look

phenomenal I love this product it's so

much fun to work with and it's great to

be able to put your own personal touch

on your firearms and your accessories oh

that's so fun that is so fun

oh if natalie ever commits murder a

grave oversight

good news chief the mag says the

killer's name right on it we don't know

what motivated them to go on a killing

spree but we do know she had a lot of

fun with it we've watched every single

episode of love at first shot and I have

to show you our favorite clip it's from

season 2 episode 1 the host natalie is

pregnant at this point so she can't join

in on the shooting but that doesn't mean

they didn't find a way to get her

involved we are going to make art for

Natalie since she couldn't be on the

range with us we're gonna do something

special for her to hang in her baby

nursery we know that you're expecting

obviously really thought we would make a

little something for it the baby's

nursery they shot paint so when somebody

inevitably asks why you have what

appears to be a blank canvas with a

large blood stain hanging up in your

Charles nursery you'll be able to

completely reassure them by saying oh

yeah my friend shots that for me but it

is not all fun with guns where an RA T V

really comes into its own is when its

tongue gets much darker which it does

for instance they have a series of

hunting videos which shouldn't be

surprising in fact it makes complete

sense people do use guns when they hunt

but while the visuals are predictable

Beauty shots of nature the voiceover

takes a different path somewhere over

this horizon sit a million little

dictators eager to purge humanity of its

hunting instincts the anti hunters had

imposed a false quarter

their lives based on a misconceived

perception of the world death is evil

they believe and so the purveyor of

death must also be evil death is an

undeniable fuel of life oh boy

God that is less planet Earth and more

deranged letter from a serial killer

although to be honest I would respect

the NR a a lot more if its slogan were

just the NRA because death is an

undeniable fuel of life I would like it

but at least we be clear where they were

coming from and that flowery vaguely

threatening tone is a key feature of NRA

TV here is another weird example hidden

beneath the dense canopy of deciduous

trees as a prostitute of sorts and those

who profit by selling her will stop at

nothing to exploit her sold and promoted

for her non-addictive even medicinal

advantages what lies behind the veil of

this seductress is far different than

what she first appears to be she is a

Harvard and her name is Mary Jane

[Music]

I didn't think this was possible but I

think that guy's just slut-shamed

marijuana and don't get me started on

mushrooms those filthy tramps they'll

grow next to any tree at all pause with

spores that's what I call them and if

you are wondering why NRA TV is even

talking about drugs at all the final

defining characteristic of the network

is painting a bleak vision of America

with threats around every single corner

and one solution next attack on our soil

could come in a matter of minutes

teenage girls are trafficked in sex

trade today's America is plagued by

urban riots and domestic Isis

sympathisers a natural disaster

you may call 9-1-1 and there may be

nobody on the other line the drug

cartels and the human traffickers who

have invaded our borders and embedded in

every single American city this threat

is real

our leaders are either incapable of or

unwilling to protect you and the ar-15

is one of the most effective tools

available to protect yourself and your

family holy they're using the same

techniques as an infomercial there is

human traffic getting you down do you

have Isis sympathisers in those

hard-to-reach places being tired of

getting 911 s there's got to be a better

way try the ar-15 available at way too

many stores near you now to watch NRA TV

is to watch a constant stream of stories

like those many of them real but

amplified to terrify you and sell you

products and there may be a good reason

that it sounds like an infomercial

because it is many of NRA TV shows are

sponsored by gun brands like Smith &

Wesson and behind the scenes of NRA TV

is an ad agency

it's called Ackerman McQueen they've

worked with the NRA for decades and the

Ackerman McQueen web site proclaims

every brand must be its own media

company and that is what the NRA have

done with their TV arm they've got a

product to sell and they employ people

who can sell that product well even Dana

lash the clenched fist of truth when

she's not warning a

the drug cartels and human traffickers

in every single American city

she's just selling you some other

hi i'm dana lash from the danish oh

there's one super food i drink every day

for healthy circulation and to make me

feel great all day long it's called

super beats and you can try for yourself

risk free i take super beats as my

pre-workout in the morning and as a non

jittery pick-me-up in the afternoon and

just one teaspoon of super beats gives

you the benefit of three whole beets Wow

Dana 3 whole beets

that's more than my delicious superfood

medium beats it gives you the benefits

of two whole beets which is and this is

true enough that's a perfectly adequate

number of beats the point the whole

point here is the answer to the question

what the is NRA TV is it's just a

vessel to sell America guns that's

pretty much it does it work it's

honestly hard to say they won't reveal

their rating so it's plausible that no

one is watching this and that that ad

agency akima McQueen are making out like

bandits

but look having having watched a

shitload of NRA TVs programming here is

what I'll say about it there is a lot to

be concerned about regarding the NRA s

activities but NRA TV might actually be

the dumbest most transparent thing that

it does think about it this way if the

NRA is a ferocious bear charging at you

NRA TV is that Bears ridiculous hat is

it i catching sure it is is it

perversely entertaining absolutely is it

the main thing you should be worried

about probably not because the real

truth here is hat or no hat it is

imperative that everyone keep their eyes

on that bear and now this and

now proof that NRA TVs tone can make

anything seem scary has your kitchen

that once believed in the south glow of

dawn

become a bleak gulag of countertops bent

and shameful submission to breakfast

perverse tyrant she is the ovens

contemptible whore and her name is

muffins the muffin is a gluttonous

prison each very a fruit slave within

its crusty walls Americans once relished

our right to a stack of flapjacks and a

cup of joe but now we tremble before

satan's cupcakes uncut and flapjacks

unstacked muffins rise we must rise

against death because you don't know the

muffin man america and you better pray

you'd never do pancakes the undeniable

fuel of life oh thank you so much for

watching see you next week good night

[Applause]

across the broad expanse of history

there have been billions upon billions

of idiots as well as a handful of smart

people we interviewed some of the latter

group for our ongoing series great minds

people who think good

this week's people who thinks good

Stephen Hawking international

best-selling author and a popular guest

character on The Simpsons

yeah just trying to use his breakthrough

work on black holes and string theory is

considered hugely important by anyone

who pretends to understand it an

expanding universe does not preclude our

creator I traveled to the Department of

Applied Mathematics and theoretical

physics at Cambridge University to speak

with one of the world's greatest living

minds first off congratulations on being

the first subject of our great mind

series be honest is this the single

greatest honor you have ever received

yes good it's a little hard to read your

tone of voice when you say that are you

being sarcastic yes if there is one

thing you want people to understand

about your work bearing in mind that

most people will never understand

anything about your work what would that

thing up against a deadline but it's a

well-defined concept the imaginary time

is like another direction in space it's

the one bit of my work science fiction

writers have used because they don't

understand it

idiots people are such idiots because

presumably to my mind you're simply

talking about the theoretical

measurement obtained from real time by a

wink rotation of pi divided by two in

the complex

plain wet T equals I times T she's not

that difficult to get your head around

let's talk about artificial intelligence

in a recent op-ed column you said and I

quote success in creating artificial

intelligence would be the biggest event

in human history unfortunately it might

also be the last are you saying that

robots are going to destroy humanity and

is that a scientific argument or the

pitch for an amazing movie I know you're

trying to get people to be cautious

there but why should I not be excited

about fighting a robot I couldn't then

just unplugging in so it could be turned

off holy that's the most terrifying

story I've ever heard

hold on who is talking to me right now

is it you or is the sentient computer

pretending to talk on your behalf yeah

but how do I know that professor because

if computers had become sentient what

better way to convince people they

hadn't then by co-opting the voice of

the most intelligent man on the planet

[Applause]

okay alright with that

that's actually quite reassuring you

stated that you believed there could be

an infinite number of parallel universes

does that mean that there is a universe

out there where I am smarter than you

if you're so smart what number am I

thinking of

today what it was 13 or what I was

thinking of 13 okay that was a lucky

guess what am I thinking right now I

wasn't thinking that what would I think

that you know I'm trying as hard as I

can

why is that so hard for them to

understand quite effectively or what I'm

thinking that let's do some quick yes or

no questions are the following things

technically possible life on other

planets is that theoretically possible

yes

okay what about a Schwarzschild wormhole

yes okay what about this me going on a

date with Charlize Theron in no universe

in none of the infinite universes does

that happen it's completely beyond the

bounds of scientific possibility is what

you're saying yes quick follow-up

question in any of those potential

universities and either one rejecting

her and that's why it doesn't work out

okay sure yeah it's just I'm trying to

play this out because it just I just

trying to see if there was any

hypothetical hole it doesn't matter but

never say never okay if time travel were

possible would you want to go back in

time and refused to do this interview

yes

you truly are an incredibly smart man

Stephen Hawking thank you so much for

your time

many story tonight concerns government

sports for nerds these days we are all

focused on the presidential race the

biggest most prominent office in all of

government but I would like to talk

about the opposite of that one of the

smallest and most obscure forms of

government special districts that's

right tonight we are talking about

special taxing districts so hello people

watching for the first time because of

our Trump piece and also I presume

goodbye goodbye thanks for checking in

but just so you know special districts

are small units of government with the

power to take tax dollars to do one

specific thing you've probably heard of

a five district or a water district but

they can be set up for almost any

purpose and there are way more of them

than you think special districts over

the past half-century have really

proliferated to the point that we have

about 40,000 of them in the country now

and they account for about a hundred

billion dollars of spending a hundred

billion dollars a year that is sixteen

billion more than Russia spends on its

military and when you include school

districts special districts are the most

common form of local governments in the

country and that's crazy it's like

finding out the highest-paid athlete in

the world is Harold I mean who the

is Harold what sport does he play why

don't people talk about this all the

time how am I only hearing about

Harold's now you're making me feel a

fool special districts are so ubiquitous

and sometimes have so little

accountability states may not even know

how many they have or how much they

spent a few years back Idaho launched an

investigation of special districts with

objective one being identify how many

special districts there are in Idaho and

when Kentucky investigated it order to

found that 40% of its districts that

were required to didn't even file proper

budgets I mean this is this is an

extraordinary mess as one of my good

friends says you can't make this up 2.7

billion dollar system of government

operating because of a lack of oversight

and accountability at almost every level

has been permitted to become a level of

ghost government yes ghost governments

I'm not even the shittiest idea

ghost story I've ever heard a sign of

course from ghost dad and that was a bad

idea before context changed the way we

felt about Bill Cosby having the power

to walk through walls before then it was

a bad idea after it was horrifying but

if you think about it it's a little

weird in a country that talks so much

about government accountability that a

huge amount of our tax dollars go to

fund entities that most of us know

absolutely nothing about you may not

even know how many districts you are

living in right now a school district

may overlap with a park district a water

district your sewer district and so on

such that it wouldn't be at all uncommon

for one person to be finding themselves

within the boundaries of ten or more of

these districts that's right think of a

special district like a cult it can take

your money and you may not even be aware

that you are in one although it is worth

remembering in a special district

allowing the leader to impregnate you is

not mandatory no matter what the guy in

charge of the library district says no

matter what he says with his words or

eyes and if you're thinking we'll look

what difference does it make what

districts I'm in well it can actually

make a big difference one person that we

found paid a thousand dollars as part of

an irrigation special district that he

lives in in north central Phoenix his

neighbor literally across the street is

not a part of that district they're

special district bill was $7.00 1000

versus $7 look the only people who

should be paying a thousand dollars more

than their neighbors across the street

are the assholes who cover every square

inch of their house with Christmas

decorations they should be taxed and

then they should be imprisoned and then

they should be told their lights were

better last year because it's that one

that would hurt them the most that's the

one that would sting

and it is important to note here in

theory and often in practice having

small entities with a single purpose can

be a great idea

take Litchfield New Hampshire in 2007

they chose to create a mosquito control

districts to you know control mosquitoes

it's run by two men who as you will see

from an amazing YouTube video of one of

their public meetings are almost

heartbreakingly conscientious regardless

of the fact that there is no one else in

the room which I'll steam for the Pledge

of Allegiance call the roll

thank you boys cheer mr. otto present

i'm here you have got to admire their

dedication to the rules these two men

are so scrupulous they would sit and a

broken red traffic light for six hours

in the middle of the night red is red we

live in a civilized society red is red

we stay in fact they ran that 43 minute

meeting so meticulously they even took

input from the public with predictable

results any members of the public

wishing to speak

I guess when you're a member of a ghost

government it's only natural your

meetings are going to be attended only

by the ghost public now that that is the

best case scenario and many special

districts are like that chugging along

just fine with no major problems but

some like the Isaacson Municipal Utility

District in Texas are not because an

audit recently discovered $70,000 in

losses and that the district builds

residents for water with a disturbing

consistency we're not all professional

accountants or managers we may not have

looked at things as closely as maybe we

should have I mud has been billed for

thirteen million seven hundred twenty

one two hundred gallons of water every

year for the last six years rain or

drought or weather no change

same number now no charges have been

followed there but that level of

consistency is weird the only time the

exact same amount of water should appear

in a document year after year is in

shambo's writer yeah Shamu gets thirteen

point seven million gallons of water at

his tank at all times and not a drop

less he's a artist I'm obviously

kidding you can keep him in a wading

pool if you want and if you want to

his blowhole that will be an extra 20

the point is thanks for visiting

SeaWorld but but in Kentucky in Kentucky

the lack of supervision led to outright

corruption with over a hundred thousand

dollars being fantastically misspent by

one former assistant fire chief the

report claims the garret volunteer fire

department in Floyd County used taxpayer

money to buy things like flat screen

televisions chewing tobacco and

fireworks investigators say they also

found hundreds of pornographic videos on

department electronics all right all

right porn and chewing tobacco

obviously inappropriate but you know

what really upsets me the most they're

fireworks there are fire department

hearing EMTs have been using their

budget to stage scissor races thank you

natural enemy but that behavior was

nothing compared to what happened in a

fire district in Rhode Island you won't

believe the undercover video we gathered

on the man in charge we spotted him

drinking during the day then driving the

fire department vehicle back to work

we even had him taking the public safety

vehicle to party up on Federal Hill

drinking and apparently smoking

marijuana this is you smoking what looks

to be pot so God maybe you didn't share

the cigar with your friend sir

I don't know that's a cigar yes it is

you know I got to tell you if no one's

gonna buy that I'm pretty sure they'll

definitely buy it um that's a cigar just

like that's flour for when you want to

bake one tiny cookie that's honey for my

tea I use a very specific amount and

that's just some quartz I keep laying

around

I love quartz look corruption is not

unique to special districts there are

clearly problems in all other forms of

government as well but when special

districts only have one job it makes it

all the more noticeable when things go

wrong take Evergreen Park Illinois the

county it scene has four different

mosquito abatement districts to prevent

the spread of West Nile so it had to be

humiliating when this happened the mayor

of West Suburban Evergreen Park came

down with West Nile virus

look merica King West Nile look no one

is expecting a zero percent failure rate

here but if you're surrounded by that

many mosquito abatement districts

shouldn't there at least be agents

willing to take a mosquito for him come

on and one of the most interesting ways

that special districts are different

from any other form of government is how

they can be created seemingly out of

thin air

for instance in Conroe Texas a company

was hoping to create a new neighborhood

on undeveloped land they wanted to form

a special district which can issue bonds

now to do this the law required a vote

but remember no one lived there yet so

guess what they did

when Tim Kellerman saw someone

installing a mobile

next to his house recently he asked them

what's going on he told me is none of my

business this man and his wife moved in

on Monday and signed a nine-month lease

with stingray services after that he

said they're moving out they're the only

two people who can vote on five hundred

million dollars worth of bonds for the

new housing project two people voting

for five hundred million dollars of

bonds and then leaving it's as if in the

Lion King Simba's father looked out over

the plains and said son someday this

will all be someone else's problem and

they both could often never came back

and that whole process is perfectly

legal in fact this wasn't the only place

where stingray services provided what

they called turnkey voter trailer

election services they won't even

advertised on Craigslist with an ad

reading eligible tenants will vote in

and serve as election officials for the

election which takes place in the home

oh that's right you're not just the only

voters you're the election officials and

your trailer is the polling station it

makes you wonder why they didn't just

throw in some ballot

initiatives just for fun oh and on the

motion that Jena start cleaning out her

hairbrush could it starting to

look like we have a cat we seem to be

tied one to one and once once a special

district is created you can be pretty

sure no one is going to be watching what

you do because remember that New

Hampshire video when we found it on

YouTube it had zero views zero meaning

those two guys themselves didn't even

watch it that is anti viral as videos go

and voter accountability is pretty

unlikely - one County in New York found

turnout rates for some special district

elections could be as low as one point

eight percent which might be because

that County held on average one special

district election every ten point nine

business days with not a single one

taking place on Election Day which just

seems inherently suspicious think about

it it would be a bit of a red flag if

someone in your neighborhood offer

children candy every 11 days but never

on Halloween

give you pause for thought and even if

the state government does investigate

special districts may try to blow them

off when that Kentucky auditor started

asking his state's districts about

they're making their information

available to the public he got some

pretty unhelpful responses here's one

direct quote by the way we didn't take

any liberties with these quote this

contains information the public is not

entitled to know this is a good one we

don't want to fill this out because

there are too many crackpots in the

world and my favorite well we just

rather the public contact us directly to

gain information so we know who's asking

what you get the sense that preferred

mode of contact would be an email to

fake email address at gov and and by the

way if after hearing that some

Kentuckians wanted to shut a district

down they might not be able to because

as that order to wrote many types of

districts may continue to exist because

there is not a process for them to be

dissolved there's no way to break them

up they're like styrofoam packing

peanuts or the enduring friendship of

Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake

they'll be with us until the end of time

now to be fair some states are pushing

to reform special districts California

for instance has made them far more

transparent in recent years and as

special districts Association in San

Diego even launched a competition for

school children to create a one-minute

video educating the public about what's

so special about special districts the

deadline was Tuesday and it had a $1,500

top prize and the reason I know that is

we entered with some local school kids

and this is the

these toxoids special districts what

special about them special districts of

small government that collect taxes that

handled one specific service like fight

fire or provide water by fireworks or

smoke cigars special districts are

special because they can receive little

oversight they sometimes got ghost

governments I used to be afraid of those

but now offering girls special districts

can also be very easy to create

sometimes the only people voting for

them are two people in a field and the

middle of nowhere the two people in the

trailer in an empty field

sounds like my younger brother you know

it's true duckling you won't wanted

sometimes special districts aren't so

special though like when the mayor of a

village in a county with for mosquito

spring districts came down with the West

Nile virus that would barely be

acceptable if your tongue we're near the

actual Niles everything you think so

little about you don't even realize

that's not important is to get rid of

them so obviously they would never meet

because that's crossing universes

so to recap special districts save their

money and do whatever they want with it

with little to no consequences what I

grew up I want to be a special district

you

our main story tonight and I cannot

believe I'm saying this is Donald Trump

and I say that I said that knowing that

every time his name is said out loud

he has a shattering orgasm we have

mostly ignored Trump on this show but he

is now won three states has been

endorsed by chris Christie and polish al

him leading most Super Tuesday states

which is a big deal since 1988 every

candidate who's won the most states on

Super Tuesday went on to become their

party's nominee so at this point Donald

Trump is America's back mold it may have

seemed harmless a year ago but now that

it's gotten frightening ly bigger it is

no longer wise to ignore it and I do

understand why Trump supporters might

like him he's unpredictable and

entertaining just look how he went after

Marco Rubio on Friday did you ever see a

guy sweat like this

it's Rubio

that's objectively funny just as it was

funny when a few years ago he tweeted I

would like to extend my best wishes to

all even the haters and losers on this

special date September the 11th he

wished haters and losers are happy 9/11

there is a part of me that even likes

this guy it's a part of me I hate but it

is a part of me and if you are someone

who's sick of the party establishment he

might seem like a protest candidate with

some attractive qualities we like him

like it is he says what he means I

honestly believe he's telling the truth

he's funding his own campaign nobody

owns him he's aggressive I think he's an

incredible businessman if he runs the

country like he runs his organization we

would be in good shape

Donald Trump can seem appealing until

you take a closer look much like the

lunch buffet and a strip club or the NFL

or having a pet chimpanzee sure it seems

fun but someday Coco's going to tear

your limbs off because let's

look at each of those qualities those

people listed first he tells it like it

is

does he because the website politifact

checks 77 of his statements and rated 76

percent of them as varying degrees of

false and I've witnessed this firsthand

he once attacked my old boss by tweeting

if Jon Stewart is so above it all and

legit why did he change his name from

Jonathan Leibovitz he should be proud of

his heritage and then two years later

rose I never attacked dopey Jon Stewart

for his phony last name would never do

that

and then just last year he claimed

falsely to have turned down an invite to

appear on this very boring show and

who's he trying to impress with that lie

our show's guests include sloths

and puppies we're basically a petting

zoo with a desk but when we pointed out

that he had never been invited this is

how he responded all of a sudden I see

people saying that John Oliver and her

st. John Oliver and I checked with my

people he asked me to be on the show

four or five times and I I don't even

hardly know who it was I wouldn't know

what he looks like

I wouldn't expect him to know who I was

although for his inevitable angry tweet

about this segment I'll tell him what I

look like I look like a nearsighted

parrot who works at a bank secondly it

was genuinely destabilizing to be on the

receiving end of a lie that confidence I

even checked to make sure that no one

had even accidentally invited him and of

course they hadn't and and I'm not even

sure he knows he's lying I think he just

doesn't care about what the truth is

Donald Trump gives the truth like this

Lima views the Supreme Court vacancy I

don't care about that in any way please

off I have a banana

so let's move on let's move on to his

next selling points that he is truly

independent and not beholden to anyone

or as he puts it I'm self-funding my

campaign I tell the truth he'll be

Spence of fact probably 2025 million

dollars okay let's break that down first

I'm rich therefore I tell the truth has

the same internal logic as I'm a vegan

therefore I know karate there is no

cause and effect between those two and

the correlation usually goes the other

way and while it is true that he hasn't

taken corporate money the implication

that he has personally spent twenty to

twenty five million dollars is a bit of

a stretch because what he's actually

done is loaned his own campaign

seventeen and a half million dollars and

has just personally given just two

hundred and fifty thousand dollars and

that's important because up until the

convention he can pay himself back for

the loan with campaign funds and if you

don't think there's a significant

difference between a gift and a loan try

giving your spouse an anniversary loan

and see how that goes

and even he himself sometimes admits

that his campaign is by no means

completely self-funded I'm self-funding

my campaign other than the little tiny

ones where they send in you know women

sending we had a woman seven dollars and

fifty nine cents what do you do how can

you send the money back do you know it's

a nice it's cute it's beautiful they

feel invested in you campaign he makes

it sound like women a stuffing grimy

dollar bills in envelopes writing Donald

Trump on the front and he's just too

kind to send them back but he's taken in

seven and a half million dollars in

individual contributions and if he

didn't want him maybe shouldn't have had

to donate button's on his website

because money isn't unsolicited when you

have to ask for someone's credit card

expiration date to receive it okay so

how about the claim that he is tough

well again I'm not sure about that

because for a tough guy he has

incredibly thin skin back in 1988 spy

magazine called him a short fingered

Bulgarian and ever since the editor

Graydon Carter says he receives

envelopes from Trump always with a photo

on which he circled his hand to

highlight the length of his fingers

usually with a nose reading see not so

short look his fingers seem fine but the

very fact he's so sensitive about them

is absolutely hilarious as is the fact

that those notes were apparently written

in gold sharpie which is so

quintessentially Donald Trump something

that gives the passing appearance of

wealth but is actually just a cheap tool

his signature tough talk often involves

lawsuits he loves to threaten to sue

people like he did with Rosie O'Donnell

she said I was bankrupt I never went

bankrupt so probably I'll sue her

because it would be fun I'd like to take

some money out of her fat-ass pockets of

course of course he needs to take Rosie

O'Donnell to court to take money out of

her pockets because his tiny tiny

fingers are too short to

he never sued Rosie O'Donnell in fact

he's repeatedly threatened people with

lawsuits and not followed through

including the rapper Mac Miller lawrence

O'Donnell Vanity Fair and an activist

who launched a petition for Macy's to

drop Trump's products I'll sue you is

Trump's version of bazinga it doesn't

really mean anything but he says it all

the time but perhaps Trump's biggest

selling point as a candidate is his

success and where could people get that

idea from I'm really rich I actually

think I have the best temperament people

love me and you know what I've been very

successful everybody loves me I went to

an Ivy League school

I'm very highly educated I know words I

had the best words oh please

literally the biggest word in the

sentence I have the best words is the

word words well it's worth noting well

yes he has made more money than most of

us will make in a lifetime not only did

he get a multi-million dollar

inheritance from his father but he's

also lost a huge amount and this is

where we need to be careful because as

we've learned he will he will threaten

to sue your fat ass pockets with his

cocktail sausage fingers

if you talk about his company's

bankruptcies so I will just let his own

daughter describe the state of his

finances at one point in his life I

remember once my father and I were

walking down Fifth Avenue and there was

a homeless person sitting sitting right

outside of Trump Tower and I remember my

father pointing to him and saying you

know that guy has eight billion dollars

more than me because he was in such

extreme debt at that point you know and

that really shows you the indomitable

spirit of Donald Trump to fall to his

lowest point and in that very moment

still find a way to be kind of a dick to

a homeless guy now now his campaign

claims his current worth is in excess of

ten billion dollars and they've written

it in all caps so it must be true

but others have disputed that figure in

fact a book won't suggested that Trump

might be worth a mere 150 to 250 million

dollars which Trump protested by suing

the writer for 5 billion dollars which

is a pretty roundabout way of getting

half the way to 10 billion and you

should note for the record Trump lost

that lawsuit twice but I am glad that he

sued if only because during the

deposition he explained that his

estimate of his net worth fluctuates

based on and I quote feelings even my

own feelings and that can change rapidly

from day to day think about that he

claimed that his net worth changes

depending on his mood which makes

absolutely no sense partly because he

always seems to be in the same mood

specifically smug yet gassy a

significant portion of his self

valuation is intangible his brand is

what he values very much and it his

disclosure form that is released it's

about three billion dollars that's what

he values his brand as exactly he values

his own name at 3 billion dollars and

I'm not saying a name can't have value

it's why people will pay $120 for a

plain white t-shirt that is designed by

Kanye West I don't want just any white

t-shirts they want one designed by a

bored sociopath with a finger free anus

but three billion dollars seems a bit

high especially because while Trump has

said if I put my name on something you

know it's gonna be good over the years

his name has been on some things that

have arguably been very uncooked

including Trump shuttle which no longer

exists Trump vodka which was

discontinued Trump magazine which folded

trunk world's magazine which also folded

Trump University over which he's being

sued and of course the travel booking

site go Trump calm those grief existence

was I imagine a real thorn in the side

of anyone hoping got Trump calm feature

a single thing worth masturbating to and

that's not even mentioning licks when it

comes to great steaks I've just raised

the stakes Trump steaks are the world's

greatest steaks and I mean that in every

sense of the word and the sharper image

is the only store where you can buy them

not only can you not buy those steaks

anymore but why did he sell them at the

sharper image that is a weird choice I

will take a massage chair an indoor

waterfall and eight and a half pounds of

the finest meat in America and sure

every business executive is bound to

have a few missteps but Trump's lack of

sound financial instincts is perhaps

best exemplified by the business that he

put his name on back in 2006 just before

the entire housing market collapsed I

think it's a great time to start a

mortgage company we're gonna have a

great company it's Trump mortgage and

Trump mortgage calm and it's gonna be a

terrific company yeah it wasn't in fact

starting a mortgage company in 2006 with

one of the worst decisions you could

possibly make but I guess you can

convince yourself it was a good idea

when you say 30 words and five of them

are great great terrific Trump and Trump

and you might say well never mind side

business is what he really is

is a builder but a building with Trump

written on it is not necessarily owned

by him he may have just licensed his

name to them something he claims is

actually better than ownership you don't

put up money you don't put up anything

spoken like a true builder and some of

those licensed buildings sell his

reputation hard like the sales video for

the Trump Ocean Resort in northern

Mexico I'm very very proud of the fact

that when I build I have investors that

follow me all over people ask me what is

Trump stand for more than anything else

and if I use one word it's always

quality right but it's easy to throw

around the word quality have you ever

stayed at a quality in the pillows are

stuffed with hair they fished out of the

bathtub drain

he was never the builder for that

project which was later abandoned

leaving would-be condo buyers like

William Flint who lost a hundred and

sixty eight thousand dollars feeling

understandably betrayed Donald Trump was

an expert in these types of projects or

so we thought

in a deposition for a lawsuit regarding

the property Trump's son Donald Trump

jr. conceded that the Trump brand could

lead people to think a project was a

solid investment there's one of the

things that you've learned through this

process is that the Trump name bring

stability and their viability to the

project I don't have a bring stability

or viability but I imagine certain

people feel that and that might actually

be the most honest slogan for the Trump

campaign from 2016 I don't know if it

brings stability or viability but I

imagine certain people feel that not

only good investors in that property sue

Donald Trump they also did in Trump

Tower tamper another project that never

got off the ground and in both cases

Trump characteristically deflected blame

onto the developers and you would think

those investors will be facing it up

impossible legal battle given Trump's

tough talk when I get sued I take it

right oil tits take it all the way you

know what happens if you settle suits

you get sued more it's true I don't

settle anything I don't settle guess

what

he settled both those cases but the

problem is even when you condemn monster

we prove Trump to be wrong it's somehow

never seems to matter

you can hold his feet to the fire but

it'll just stand there on the stumps

bragging about his fireproof thought

skin

and that may be because he has spent

decades turning his own name into a

brand synonymous with success and

quality and he's made himself the mascot

for that brand like Ronald McDonald or

Chef Boyardee and that is who we have

seen in the apprentice or Wrestlemania

or home alone - but if he's actually

going to be the Republican nominee it's

time to stop thinking of the mascot and

start thinking of the man because a

candidate for president needs a coherent

set of policies whatever you think about

Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz at least you

basically know where they stand but

Trump's opinions have been wildly

inconsistent

he's been pro-choice and pro-life for

and against assault weapon bans in favor

of both bringing in Syrian refugees and

deporting them out of the country and

that inconsistency can be troubling just

this morning for instance he was asked

about the fact that David Duke former

Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan had

told supporters to vote for him and this

was his answer will you unequivocally

condemn David Duke and say that you

don't want his vote or that of other

white supremacists in this election what

you see you understand I don't know

anything about David Duke okay I don't

know anything about what you're even

talking about with white supremacy or

white supremacists honestly I don't know

David Duke I don't believe I've ever met

him I pretty sure I didn't meet him and

I just don't know anything about him

really that's your best answer there

because you definitely know who he is

partly because you called him a bigot

and a racist in the past but that's not

even the point the point is with

an answer like that you are either

racist or you are pretending to be and

at some point there is no difference

there and sure he disavowed David Juke

later in the day but the scary thing is

we have no way of knowing which of his

inconsistent views he will hold in

office will he stand by a statement that

vaccines are linked to autism or his

belief that Mexico is sending us rapists

oh and what about that plan he had to

defeat Isis we're fighting a very

politically correct war with the

terrorists you have to take out their

families when you get these terrorists

you have to take out their families they

care about their lives don't kid

yourself what you say they don't care

about the less you have to take out

their families that is the frontrunner

for the Republican nomination advocating

a war crime and he might say he was

joking or he's changed his mind about

any of these things and private

individuals are allowed to change their

minds we all do it but when he's sworn

in as president on January 20th 2017 on

that day his opinions are going to

matter and you will remember that date

because it's the one that time travelers

from the future will come back to to try

and stop the whole thing from happening

I get that the character of Donald Trump

is entertaining and that he says things

that people want to hear and I know his

very name is powerful just listen to

this one Supporter explain what it means

to her I was a little girl well I didn't

even know what Trump Towers were but I

knew that he was a wealthy successful

man somehow like there was even as a

very young kid the word Trump sort of

meant riched it meant success she's not

even wrong Trump does sound rich it's

almost onomatopoeic Trump is the sound

produced when a mouthy servant is

slapped across the face with a water

thousand dollar bills Trump it's the

sound of a cork popping on a couple's

champagne over Suri the data renovations

in the wine cellar were finally

completed the very name Trump is the

cornerstone of his brand if only there

were a way to uncouple that magical word

from the man he really is well guess

what there is because it turns out the

name Trump was not always his family's

name one biographer found that a

prescient ancestor had changed it from

and this is true drunk yes

and is much less magical if the sounds

produced when they morbidly obese pigeon

flies into the window of the poor

clothes Old Navy drunk it's the sound of

a bottle of store-brand root beer

falling off the shelf in a gas station

mini-mart and it may seem weird to bring

up his ancestral name but to quote

Donald Trump he should be proud of his

heritage because drunk is much more

reflective of who he actually is so if

you are thinking of voting for Donald

Trump the charismatic guy promising to

make America great again stop and take a

moment to imagine how you would feel if

you just met a guy named donald drumpf a

litigious serial liar with a string of

broken business ventures and the support

of a former Klan leader who he can't

decide whether or not to condemn would

you think he would make a good president

or is the spell now somewhat broken and

that is why tonight I'm asking America

to make donald drumpf again hashtag

makes Donald Trump again paperwork to

trademark the names run and incidentally

when we own it I will have the best word

and if you go to Donald J Trump calm

which we own you can download a drum for

native Chrome extension which will

replace the word Trump with drums

wherever it appears he's got browser you

can also buy these make of Donald drunk

again hats

we are selling at cloth really we've

chosen not to make a profit a factor

which will probably irritate mr. drum

more than anything else I've said

tonight and if you're thinking well

that's all great but I wish there was a

new campaign anthem for Donald Trump

well here it is now here it is right now

because listen blinded by the magic of

his name we need to see him through

fresh eyes so please don't think Donald

Trump

because he's a builder he's more of a

shitty lifestyle ground

like your losses in the morning

every time in cold sharpie good night

[Music]

president obama a man so close to being

able to smoke again he can almost taste

those camels now his time in office is

almost done and while he's achieved a

great many things tonight we're gonna

look at one of his in arguable failures

i have ordered the prison at Guantanamo

Bay closed by early next year make no

mistake we will close Guantanamo prison

I still want to close Guantanamo as

president I have tried to close Gitmo I

will continue to push to close Gitmo

it's time to close Gitmo today the

department is submitting to Congress our

plan for finally closing the facility at

Guantanamo once and for all yes

Guantanamo Bay it's Obama's one that got

away which is a little odd considering

it's a place where literally no one can

get away so why has the president been

unable to close Gitmo well for a start

most people don't want him to according

to a recent poll 52% of Americans

believe it should remain open and there

are others who believe we should

actually be using it more in my opinion

the only problem with Guantanamo Bay is

there are too many empty beds and cells

there right now we should be sending

more terrorists there for further

interrogation to keep this country safe

as far as I'm concerned every last one

of them can rot in hell but as long as

they don't do that and they can rot in

Guantanamo Bay now now he's basically

saying there let's use Guantanamo Bay

like hell's waiting room and that is

problematic for two reasons first it's

arguably unconstitutional and second

hell's waiting room is already the

slogan of Henry Kissinger's bedroom

that's a fact that's just a fact and

look I can see I can see the reasons

that Guantanamo is appealing you get to

keep potentially dangerous people locked

up and far away but tonight I would like

to argue that there are even better

reasons for closing it forever

and let's just start with the practical

ones it's very expensive

Guantanamo cost four hundred and forty

five million dollars to run last year

which means we're currently spending

over seven million dollars per prisoner

per year but the costs obviously go way

beyond that

last year a UN Human Rights Council

conducted a review of the US and Gitmo

was some

a feature Iceland recommends the closure

of the Guantanamo prison and illegal

detentions in Guantanamo Bay immediately

close the Guantanamo Bay facility and do

all its best in order to close down the

Guantanamo facilities improve living

conditions in prisoners in particular in

Guam or investigate torture allegation

extrajudicial execution and other

violations of human rights committed in

Guantanamo yeah you got it right that is

Iran Sudan Libya and others lecturing us

about human rights abuses which is yeah

a little hypocritical maybe don't tell

us to eat healthy when you have a

what perrito in your mouth but

but it does seem like this is one of the

few things the entire world agrees on

it's basically Guantanamo is up

and yeah you know what

Kevin can wait let the man wait so how

did we get here

well Guantanamo's origins are basically

a series of weird circumstances and ad

hoc decisions for start we don't own it

it's a rental in in 1903 we struck a

deal with Cuba to lease the land for a

naval base and ever since we have mailed

them a check every year for four

thousand and eighty five dollars in rent

although as Fidel Castro once told a

film crew they've just been accumulating

in his desk I get it if you'd kiss those

chi-chi's they'll go yeah no not them

Anika no just think about that we've

barely been talking to Cuba we disagree

with their politics and yet every year

we send them checks for hilariously

small amounts of money

we're basically Cuba's grandparents

and this this unique arrangement means

that Guantanamo where telephones Legally

both America and not America or as one

White House official once called it the

legal equivalent of outer space which is

a bit of an exaggeration to be honest

some laws do apply up in space there's

the law of physics for example and the

law of attraction yes of course you

didn't really think Neil and Buzz did

not on the moon right oh they moved they

moved my friends

bill would deal with that this legal

limbo has been useful to us in the past

George HW Bush used Guantanamo to

involuntarily detained Haitian refugees

seeking asylum and Bill Clinton not only

continued that for a while he later used

it to hold Cuban refugees so the use of

Gitmo to store people was one of those

dicey legal workarounds in the 90s it

was right up there with Vanilla Ice's

explanation of why he didn't trip off no

problem man now now stashing those

refugees at Gitmo attracted significant

criticism at the time but when the war

on terror began we started doing the

exact same thing with terror suspects

even though right from the start donald

rumsfeld admitted it was far from the

perfect solution pastor told people

further reasons why use it why is it the

best place I Kylie characterized Montana

MoBay Cuba as the least worst place we

could have selected the least worst

place that is a rousing endorsement from

the worst worst Secretary of Defense of

all time

obvious problem with using Guantanamo in

the war on terror and people were

pointing it out at the time how do you

avoid the prospect of the US military in

fact being jailers for an indeterminate

period of time of people who have not

been charged what are you what are you

gonna do about it it is certainly the

the not the first choice of the

Department of Defense to be in the

business of detaining people for long

periods of time yeah it might not have

been his first choice but it was

inevitable because at a war on terror

isn't a traditional war where there's an

exchange of prisoners at the end we were

never going to accept a formal surrender

from the president of terror who I can

only assume is Willem Dafoe and now that

brings us to here here right now nearly

a decade and a half later and we are all

so accustomed to the very existence of

Guantanamo that news crews tore it like

it's a million dollar listing this is a

typical cell in camp five it meets all

American Correctional Association

standards this is about 95 square feet

of living space with about 80 feet of

unencumbered space one of the other

amenities available to the detainees is

a library of books magazines and

videogames the book that we have the

most in different languages would be the

Harry Potter series inmates are also

given art classes the results of which

are on display he's making it sound like

the world's least Jewish summer camp

nobody is although even the current

luxuries the prisoners get tend to carry

a chilling reminder of where they are

all prisoners use toiletries which

happen to have the brand names maximum

security oh come on a prison calling its

deodorants maximum security is a little

on the nose it'd be like a Holiday Inn

Express calling its complimentary lotion

tearful masturbation

that hit home a little too close to some

of you and before you think that those

library books provided an escape for the

inmates just listen to shocker

Armour who was released last October

after being held without charge for

nearly 14 years he found one particular

book less an escape and more a reminder

of where he was in a beggarly they got

an island in Harry Potter he says as

become where there's no happiness they

do you know they just suck all your

feelings out of you and you don't you

don't have no feeling anymore and truly

that's what I felt all the time is this

is as back on this is not from this

world you know because that's what they

tried you know they want to make you

feel English Wow

that is the saddest allusion to Harry

Potter I have ever heard and I say that

as a man who is often described as Harry

Potter if he aged like a president and

that's the point here no amount of

sugarcoating can cover up the reality of

what we have done at Guantanamo Bay

because in the early years interrogation

techniques included physical beatings

short shackling where are prisoners arms

and legs are shackled together for long

periods and hours and sometimes days of

repeated loud music which is horrendous

although sometimes that last technique

backfired because that same Harry Potter

loving inmate grew up loving American

rock music and would annoy the guards by

singing along and just listen to him

describe the one song that gave him the

most consolation I mean I'm sure

everybody would love one here because I

used to sing here al I used to because

the words I thought the words are fits

me the words makes me feel like yeah

it's me again which is the Whitesnake

it's here I go again

the go the worst goes here I go again on

my own going down the only Road I never

known like a drifter I was born to walk

alone because I know what it means to

walk alone in only street of dreams and

here I go again and it's too because

it's just dreams dreams that I will be

home one day dreams that I'll be free

dreams that content will be closed you

know you are miserable when you are

finding solace in a Whitesnake

song that is a group whose second most

inspirational lyrics are probably I know

you ain't a bad girl honey no matter

what the neighbors say it's just you

wear those skin tight dresses with your

g-string tunes to a pure poetry purest

poetry but we justify Gitmo and

everything we did inside it because we

were constantly reminded of one thing

these are not mere innocence these are

among the worst of the worst they are

bad guys these are the worst of the

worst these are the people who are the

bomb makers the bodyguards of Asama bin

Laden the financers that the plotters

the people who have been sent out to be

assassins to be a suicide bombers these

are the worst of the worst now the worst

of the worst is a big claim I can think

of at least one person who fits that

category and who is not in there and

that's because apparently he stills

working for the Today Show but who knows

but but what but while some detainees

some detainees like Khalid Sheikh

Mohammed have clearly earned that title

others have not because think about it

if they were really also terrible it's a

little shocking that we've released

seven hundred and ten detainees over the

years and leaked documents have since

revealed four out of 212 Afghans who

were there almost half were in the

assessments of US forces either entirely

innocent mere Taliban conscripts or had

been transferred to Guantanamo with no

reason for doing so on file and some of

the evidence against detainees was

surprisingly flimsy one I guess piece of

evidence that they would use to

determine I thought this was fascinating

Casio watches

well it

it's kind of a little bit arbitrary but

anybody who was wearing this particular

brand of Casio watch which was handed

out by al-qaeda to their fighters

because it was used as a timer for

setting off devices so anybody who

happened to have this very popular watch

on was immediately picked up and a lot

of them ended up in Guantanamo Bay

that's true if someone was caught

wearing this Casio watch that could be

used as crucial evidence and

incidentally that makes this the only

time in history anyone has actively

sought out a man wearing a Casio watch

look this is not to say that everyone in

Guantanamo is or was innocent and there

is justifiable concern that whenever we

release someone they might go on to

fight against us in fact the government

claims that nearly six percent of those

released under President Obama have been

confirmed to have read in insurgent or

terrorist activities and for those

released by the Bush administration it's

been 21% and while some argue those

numbers are inflated even if they are

they are not zero and that is why

politicians like Dick Cheney have taken

a hard-line position that we should not

let anyone go I'm more concerned with

bad guys who got out and released than I

am with a few that in fact were innocent

you're okay with that margin for I have

no problem as long as we achieve our

objective yeah but that is not

reassuring the only objectives Dick

Cheney has ever achieved have been

somehow serving as president

unofficially and managing to exist

without the need for a working heart so

so there are clearly sharp divisions

about what we should do with the

remaining population and you should know

there's actually not that many left

there are currently just 61 detainees

down there that's less than the number

of people in our audience right now some

of whom are arguably worse people than

some of the detainees you know they know

they

they know it it's an odd thing to clap

and and you might think well why doesn't

the president just put them on trial

figure out which ones are guilty and

then he can decide whether or not to

close it well it's just not that simple

because the 61 detainees fall into three

groups ten of them including Khalid

Sheikh Mohammed are having their cases

handled by a military commission that is

a legal process that we've basically

invented from scratch and it's so flawed

that of its eight convictions so far

four have been fully reversed on appeal

now another 20 of them are actually

slated for release but are waiting for

the State Department the intelligence

agencies and the Department of Defense

to agree on a country to send them to

and that leaves us with the trickiest

group the remaining 31 detainees who

have not been charged with a crime but

who are also not cleared to be released

and they are the real problem here

because even the president doesn't quite

know what to do with them there's gonna

be a certain irreducible number that are

gonna be really hard cases because you

know we know they've done something

wrong and they are still dangerous but

it's difficult to mount the evidence

than a traditional article 3 court more

so we're gonna have to wrestle a bit now

think about what he just said that is

the president a man who has taught

constitutional law suggesting that for

some detainees there is no clear path

toward a trial or an exit now it's a

group that the administration is called

the irreducible minimum which sounds

like the name of a band that was going

to call itself absolute zero but got

into a fight about it with their

pretentious theremin player

and if you're wondering why the

president says it's difficult to

announce the evidence what it means

there is in some cases there's not

enough of its and in others it was

obtained through torture and there is a

good reason that that is inadmissible

because people often say anything to

make torture stop if you gave me a

purple nurple for just 10 seconds I

would look you in the eye and swear that

my favorite cereal is grape nuts and and

I'm fairly sure that that cereals

original name was good-morning idiot eat

some cat litter so the point is how does

the president who has spent nearly a

decade promising to close Gitmo plan to

do that well it turns out it all depends

on what your definition of the word

close is closing Guantanamo at this

stage in the Obama administration view

is really moving Guantanamo to US soil

the idea is to pick up the last

detainees and move them to military

detention in the United States what we

call Guantanamo North yes Guantanamo

North or as I'm sure it will be called

once they build a wholefoods their Gitmo

no and look moving Guantanamo is not

closing it but even that is not going to

happen there's been relentless

congressional opposition to moving any

detainees to US soil and the people in

charge of Gitmo seem to be settling in

for the long haul and the reason we know

that is because a legal document from

last month showed the commander the

current commander there proposes

renovating their infirmary as it will be

beneficial to the continued care of the

aging population so there might well be

detainees that we scooped up as young

men who we think are guilty but who will

never get a trial and they will be there

until they die and at this point we all

have to ask ourselves are we okay with

that and remember it does seem that more

than half of us are but I would argue

that any potential risk in putting

detainees on trial losing that case and

having to release them is worth it for a

few important reasons first as it stands

we are ceding so much moral high-ground

that Vladimir Putin feels comfortable

saying things like this but then you

they once said that they would close

Guantanamo and what is it closed no

today there's still people there walking

in shackles that is just medieval

without a trial these people stay in

prison well just imagine can you imagine

if we did that here I can't wrap my head

around it

luckily here in Russia the people I do

not like just disappear for reasons well

supporters of Guantanamo argue that

closing it would be a sign of weakness I

would argue it's an act of strength just

listen to Lawrence Wilkins Wilkerson :

Powell's former chief of staff what do

we do with them do we leave them there

forever as an American citizen who is

not a coward

I'd be willing to release every one of

them tomorrow morning and face them on

the battlefield again if necessary but

we got a lot of cowards in this country

these days exactly when you see a bumper

sticker that says freedom isn't free

this is what that means standing up for

our highest ideals even when it requires

accepting a certain amount of risk and

when that bumper sticker was displayed

above a pair of red white and blue truck

nuts it's a good reminder that doing

something like that takes balls and and

there is actually one final thing to

consider here the concept of Guantanamo

represents an opportunity to operate

outside the boundaries of the law and

that is way too tempting a proposition

to have at the government's disposal

because well you might be someone who

trusts President Obama's judgment

remember he's on his way out now meaning

that the keys to Azkaban will be handed

over to whoever succeeds him and there

is still a possibility it's going to be

this guy we're going to keep as you know

Gitmo we're keeping that open and we're

gonna load it up with bad dudes we're

gonna load it up

a lot of bad dudes out there that's the

point

if we don't shut it down future

President Trump could theoretically

throw anyone he doesn't like into

Guantanamo and you might say well come

on he'd have to come up with some

pretext and it couldn't be an American

citizen but I would like to put it to

you that I've been talking this guy

for the better part of a year

[Applause]

are risking everything a human wave

washing over Europe southern shores

hundreds of thousands of migrants have

streamed into Europe the largest influx

there since the end of World War two Wow

the largest since the end of World War

two and remember millions of people back

then were searching both for a better

life and for the booth where it was

rumored you could slap dead Hitler and

look the scale of this story can be hard

to get your head around hundreds of

thousands of people are on the move just

within Europe and another four million

are being hosted in Turkey Lebanon and

Jordan and when numbers get that high

that can be hard to comprehend it's like

when someone tells you the size of the

audience of NCIS New Orleans 17 million

people how's that even possible

how many Navy based crimes could there

possibly be in New Orleans this doesn't

make any sense and when you are dealing

with a mass of people that large you

only want to be a little careful with

how you describe them unfortunately

David Cameron noted alleged swine

fellatio enthusiast recently referred to

a swarm of people coming across the

Mediterranean and that language matters

because a swarm of anything sounds

terrifying

no matter what it is if I hear there are

a lot of kittens coming my way I'm going

to be delighted but if I hear there is a

swarm of kittens approaching I'm

grabbing a shotgun and I'm getting to

high ground because I'm not going to let

those furry take me alive

and here in the US some in the media

have chosen to reduce the migrant

population to one simple stereotype a

new video surfaces online showing why

some are worried Europe is opening its

doors to potential terrorists those are

reportedly Muslim refugees on a train in

Europe chanting Allah Akbar or God is

great now to be clear we're not saying

that any of those people are terrorists

or in any way affiliated with a terror

group but it does highlight just how

many of these refugees who are fleeing

violence in Iraq and Syria are Muslim

okay okay first you don't get to claim

that you're not calling those people

terrorists when your lower third says

terrorists inbound question mark if you

are really not saying they're terrorists

maybe change that to something more

accurate like people take train or some

wear hats others less so

and second describing that as a new

video that sheds light on the migrant

crisis is a little misleading because in

researching this story we found a

version of that same video uploaded onto

YouTube

back in 2010 well before this migrant

crisis even began and if you are going

to use misleading old footage to try and

make people frightened of Muslims why

stop there just go the whole way and use

a clip from True Lies now to be clear

we're not saying that any of those

people are terrorists or in any way

affiliated with a terror group but it

does highlight just how many of these

refugees who are fleeing violence in

Iraq

that's something about 10% more racist

than what you did so let's just take a

step back because for the record these

people are coming from many different

countries and fleeing everything from

civil war to economic stagnation and

while each story is unique many of them

are heartbreaking

no Gina 16 and from kobani in Syria

disabled from birth she cannot walk and

made the dangerous crossing from Turkey

last week for the first time during this

journey like a train and then a ship so

you enjoyed it yeah you're the first

person I've met who said that but to

understand why you must know the world

she escaped from at any minute what is

your dream to go out and find an alien

yes so I wanna meet the Queen oh I think

that girl absolutely deserves to meet an

alien and the Queen and also if she has

time a real human with feelings

but unfortunately for Najib and so many

like her Europe has yet to create an

effective system to process this influx

of people every country has a different

application process and some are totally

overwhelmed and underfunded we actually

got our hands on a couple of

registration forms that were given to

refugees upon arrival this one was

handed to a Syrian asylum seeker

arriving in Greece on September the 5th

it tells him to return for registration

on December the 21st and that could be a

tricky three-month wait because he's not

allowed to work in that time and yet

that is nothing compared to this form

given to an Iraqi refugee in Turkey

telling him to come back on June 15th of

2017 which sounds bad before you notice

the pink sticky notes added at the

bottom clarifying that his actual date

will be February 19th 2020 and that is

ridiculous these people can't go 5 years

without working there refugees

Renee Zellweger I'm facing that kind of

limbo

it's no wonder refugees want to try to

push deeper into Europe and many of them

are heading for one surprising country

in particular that seems to actually

want them they keep coming thousands

every day at the main train station in

Munich often greeted by applauding

locals or welcoming volunteers it's no

wonder that Germany is the preferred

destination for so many refugees that's

right amazingly one of the warmest

welcomes on offer to immigrants comes

from Germany a country whose idea of a

bedtime story is two children being left

to die in the forest before being nearly

cooked and eaten and then murdering an

old woman sleep well unfortunately many

politicians in other countries in

Germany have been actively hostile to

anyone even considering settling within

their borders no way you will not make

the Netherlands how please don't come

it's risky to come we can't guarantee

that you will be accepted here the

Danish government has published these

ads in a number of Lebanese newspapers

the text is obviously written in Arabic

and it's telling migrants don't come to

Denmark highlighting the tough

regulations and constraints that await

them there that's right

Denmark is so averse to taking people in

it's basically placing intentionally

missed connections ads in other

countries me Danish government official

you person in a Lebanese refugee camp

from the moment I saw you I knew there

was nothing between us and it could

never work perfect send but even

Denmark's approach seems friendly next

to the video apparently produced by the

mayor of a sheet aalam in Hungary

showing exactly how he and his police

forces would prevent migrants from

coming to his town model or sag Rose

Savalas - a shuttle embedding a Lego sub

[Music]

[Music]

okay okay a few things there first you

can add as much scary music as you want

there is nothing imposing about one van

drive to get load on a country road the

only message that that is sending to

migrants is make sure you wait for that

one van to pass by and second of all mr.

mayor you do realize that border police

and nightclub bouncers are not the same

thing right you look like you're about

to throw someone out of Hungary because

they didn't bring enough hot girls with

them and that mayor is no outlier

hungary has been responsible for some of

the ugliest mistreatment of refugees in

europe disturbing cell phone video

appears to show migrants at the main

refugee camp here being fed like a herd

of caged animals in a holding pen it's a

shocking video that has garnered

attention from around the world as waves

of desperate migrants sprint from a

holding camp in Hungary a camera woman

appears to trip a man running with his

child in his arms the woman also kicks

other migrants as they run including a

young girl now the camera woman is out

of a job oh I'm sorry she lost her job

that's absolutely terrible don't worry

I'm sure she can find a new one on

actual monster.com

to be fair she later apologized saying

I'm not a heartless racist children

kicking camerawoman

which I can only presume means she's a

loving accepting children kicking

camerawoman

because the children kicking part is not

really up for debate anymore and even

those countries who are offering to take

refugees are sometimes making those

offers in the most insulting Lea

selectively like Devaki ins saying that

they're only going to give asylum to two

Christians they don't want Muslims

migrants coming into the country Muslim

asylum seekers not least because they

haven't got any mosques I'm sorry

Slovakia

you can't take Muslims in because you

don't have any mosques you do know you

can build those right mosques don't

naturally occur in the wild due to

erosion or particularly devout beavers

[Applause]

dolphins trying to resettle in

Scottsdale Arizona and when refugees are

not being excluded on the basis of

religion they're being accused of being

lazy freeloaders just listen to one

polish mep address the european

parliament if we abolished all benefits

then people who don't want to work and

want to live from benefits wouldn't come

to poland and the rest of europe people

who want to work our precious however

they are sent back and we accept only

those who don't want to work it's

ridiculous policy leading to invasion of

human trash let us be clear the human

trash human garbage that doesn't want to

work human garbage those are some pretty

strong words coming from the Polish Six

Flags guy and what what he said is not

just offensive it's also wrong research

has shown that while there is some small

cost in the short term eventually an

influx of lower-wage immigrants into a

community tends to raise wages for

everyone else and a working paper

published last year by four economists

found that immigration benefited local

populations in 19 of the 20

industrialized countries they study and

think about that

adding immigrants makes things better 19

times out of

that's a success rate matched only by

bacon and paul rudd and incidentally

it's it's just a little hard to hear

these migrants and refugees being called

lazy considering how hard many of them

have worked to reach Europe in the first

place you really want to talk about lazy

migrants I'm a lazy migrant I left a

country by airplane and the only things

I was escaping were fog public a

difference and an almost certain future

as the turtle of Prince Harry's

entourage is Europe doesn't even need to

do this for good reasons it can do it

for selfish ones because as a continent

it is in dire need of new citizens

according to the UN the average woman

needs to have 2.1 children to maintain

the population of a developed country

but in the European Union every single

country is below that 2.1 level by 2050

some countries like Greece Portugal and

Germany will see their populations drop

by double-digit percentages according to

Pew that's true if Europe doesn't open

its doors to more migrants this is not

the changing face of Europe they should

be frightened of this is this one right

here and look not every single asylum

seeker is going to be the perfect

economic wellspring but instead of

worrying about the hypothetical downside

of letting these migrants in country

should be more worried about the actual

downside of turning them away if for no

other reason that you might miss out on

someone like Najim who seems like she

would improve any country that would

have her just listen to how she taught

herself English

at home with my favorite TV show

days of our lives whether you just

struggle love them both how could you

not want this girl in your country she

like came to our lives and specifically

she loves EJ and Sami in fact even after

weeks of total hell mortal danger and

inhumane treatment the jeans biggest

complaint is that the show actually

killed off EJ who was her favorite

character and frankly she's right to be

upset

EJ and Sami were magic together I mean

yes you could argue that EJ basically

blackmailed Sammy into marriage and then

impregnated her and then worked for

Sammy's arch-nemesis Nicole Walker who

he then also impregnated and then he

kidnapped Sammy's baby and made her

think it was dead so Sammy shot him in

their head but you know what that's the

kind of thing couples do and besides

they got through all that and yes yes

sure EJ did then cheat on Sammy before

their wedding with that trollop at

abigaile Deveraux but but he still

didn't deserve to die from yet another

gunshot wound even though yes it was a

best reckless for him to have a secret

meeting with hillbilly drug lord close

Western in the middle of the

woods EJ how could you go you and Sammy

were so close to eternal happiness why

AJ why why EJ my point is my point is

my point is magine has been through

enough and any country would be lucky to

have her and I know lots of people still

have fears fears that migrants will

bankrupt social systems which many

studies show does not happen fears that

migrants might have an Isis member

lurking among them which there has been

no credible example of and no one is

saying this is easy but the fact is so

hard is not a reason to do less it's a

reason to do more from countries

expediting their application process to

properly funding the UN High Commission

for Refugees whose fund for responding

to Syrian refugees in neighboring

countries is less than half of where it

needs to be to simply and I know this

sounds crazy just not kicking them when

they're moving around and that's a crazy

idea

just raelia lagging and then there is

actually one final thing that we thought

we could do and it is admittedly very

small and it is just for one refugee but

for Najim who was so justifiably

saddened by the death of ej from days of

our lives

we made some calls and we have a

surprise that is literally just for you

[Music]

no way no it's a it's me

it can't be nobody than my father could

have done about done my sister made sure

that I survived the morgue and then she

flew to Germany while my father's witch

doctors did their work physically you

know for lunch but it took a long time

to be able to get away from him and his

people after my resurrection

[Music]

I just can't imagine how horrible this

was for you who's nothing

coming back from the dead that's not

hard you know what's hard getting from

Syria to Germany have you seen what

those migrants are going through it's

the same $1,000 to bribe your way onto

rubber dinghy and that's how you get

across the Mediterranean and if you make

it to the border of Turkey they'll hand

you a form offering you an appointment

five years from now then if you're lucky

you get to navigate a barrage of bigotry

and hatred from some asshole mayor's in

Hungary someone tripping a child if

someone did that to my child he's added

twice you know there are some amazing

people coming through that border I read

about this incredible 16 year old girl

from kobani called Najim Mustafa regime

Stafford yes the gene Mustafa meter one

day

[Applause]

[Music]

you

the Affordable Care Act also known as

Obamacare or an email from your uncle as

forward forward forward

the communist takeover of American

values for years now Obamacare has been

the bane of Republicans existence if

Obamacare is ever implemented and

enforced we will never recover from it

this bill is an affront on the moral

morality of the provision of American

health care Obamacare is the worst piece

of legislation ever yes the worst piece

of legislation ever so good news

Fugitive Slave Act you finally offer

though but now Republicans controlling

both the White House and Congress

they've gone from talking about

repealing Obamacare to potentially being

able to do it already the House and

Senate have passed budget resolutions to

start the process and at least one

member is positively giving about it a

little over six years ago I lived in a

pretty decent house and one day I heard

a knock on the door and before I knew it

my colleagues from the other side of the

aisle had let it go loose in my house

now for six years that goat has been

messing in and destroying my house

I want to renovate my house but before I

can I have to get the goat out of the

house before it does any more damage it

makes no sense to start fixing up my

house until we get to go down voting for

the fiscal year 17 budget resolution

gets this goat out of my house

but is so specific there is just no way

that goat incident didn't actually

happen I bet he brings it up all the

time mr. speaker

NAFTA is like when you have a fleet one

morning you put your arm around what you

think is your wife but lo and behold

it's that goat again and you wonder why

they were my wife but you get these go

out of our house

and yes all week long Republicans will

be dealing with an unexpected problem

constituents at town halls furious that

Obamacare might be taken away I could

kill you right members of my family

included me that would be dead dead and

homeless if it was not for AC any yes

apparently that annoying Obamacare goat

in the house turned out to be a licensed

physician who's been saving life and a

lot of people do not want her to go

anywhere and yes I said her I'm sorry

you assume that goat doctor was a man

what the is wrong with you that's a

lady got to be doctors have family

that's holy it's actually a big kick

against if you remember eight years ago

people absolutely terrified about what

Obamacare might need this is the

stepping stone for copper take over my

communism like it or get in Germany

Obama's a Marxist socialist no don't do

this to us

victory theme you want to kill my

grandparents you cook Scooby first look

relax

President Obama did not want to kill

that guy's grandparents and if he did he

wouldn't have used health insurance he

just ordered a drum strike and then

declared them enemy combatants that was

his style so tonight let's look at

Obamacare what it does what needs fixing

and how Republicans plan to replace it

and before we start it's worth

remembering just how bad things were

before it was passed nearly forty nine

million Americans had no coverage and if

you buy for yourself insurance could

deny anyone they consider too risky some

denied entire professions like air

traffic controllers taxi cab drivers and

scuba divers and this baby was denied

coverage it just four months old for an

unexpected pre-existing condition his

parents decided to apply for individual

health coverage for Alex but they were

turned down not because of his age but

because he was too fat am I supposed to

pull my child on a diet

put him on a treadmill of course not

he's an infant look

yes I understand that you're upset but

think about it he's never going to lose

the weight with that attitude but the

point here is Obamacare was an attempt

to solve those problems it made it

illegal to deny people coverage because

of pre-existing conditions it let people

stay on their parents plan until age 26

McVeigh preventive screenings free for

everyone and creative market places

where people could shop for insurance

with potential subsidies and between all

that and Medicaid expansion more than 20

million people gained coverage putting

our uninsured rate at a historic low and

yes many people like this woman whose

treatment for breast cancer was covered

under Obamacare the law was just always

too closely associated with the man

responsible for it

I absolutely detest hearing the words

Obamacare the casket it just should have

been given a more proper name why be

named after our president okay what to

be clear it did have a proper name it

was the Patient Protection and

Affordable Care Act but that does goes

to show you it matters what people call

something would Emma Stone be as popular

if her real name was blump shart cracker

no no sorry that's that's why it's good

that she changed you and some of the

early accusations held against Obamacare

still linger just this month a

Republican official bill Aikens in

Florida throughout this classic and a

town hall here's the pradhans I have

with the Affordable Health Care Act

number one there is a provision in there

that anyone over the age of 74 has to go

before what is effectively a death panel

once they do yes they do it's been their

fault you're wrong

[Applause]

okay children all right children

[Applause]

is it that panel who here has read the

affordable healthcare plan I seriously

doubt that what are you talking about

the notion of death panels is just a lie

it PolitiFact's 2009 lie of the year

which is impressive considering that in

2009 America was also repeatedly told

Jason Mraz was the next big thing we

will like to win a 3-way there and look

Obamacare is not perfect it had and has

serious flaws the healthcare.gov website

was broken on day one and the president

famously made a very misleading promise

if you like your doctor you will be able

to keep your doctor period if you like

your health care plan you will be able

to keep your health care plan period the

truth is no one can promise that

insurers drop policies and doctors

change networks all the time

that is as empty a promise as a father

telling his daughter I will always keep

you safe

period really dad what about bees

what about angry swarms of bees be

honest and say I'll try to keep you safe

but these bees are not around

and I think practical problems to some

plans have deductibles so high they're

essentially unusable and in many places

premiums have increased sharply and some

insurers have dropped out although that

was partly thanks to Republicans gutting

a program in the original bill that

helps protect insurers from unexpected

loss isn't that has been something of a

pattern here

Republicans have happily complained

about the flaws in the law taking no

responsibility for fixing them and in

fact have often undermined the whole

thing but that time is now over it is

their turn to present a plan and the

clock is ticking insurance companies are

deciding right now whether to even offer

Obamacare plans next year but before you

panic there are ads on TV right now

suggesting the Republicans have been

working on something pretty special

imagine a new path forward health

insurance that provides more choices and

care at lower cost House Republicans

have a plan to get there without

disrupting existing coverage giving your

family the health care it deserves well

that sounds nice

but it is a little worrying that that

added literally encouraging you to

imagine a better health care plan close

your eyes

dream of a better way forward now open

your eyes and tell us what you came up

with because we've got nothing

and you can see something there that

ends with learn more as a better health

care plan calm but if you go there this

is the entire website a single page with

just two sentences of text and the

ad again and if you click on the

ad it'll send you back to the website

and so on and so on and so on until you

don't even want health care because

you're begging for the sweet relief of

death every time you get near something

resembling a Republican plan it seems to

just recede into the distance

in January Trump said he was working on

one and maybe it was very much

formulated down to the final strokes but

what what happened when Tom Price his

Secretary of Health and Human Services

was asked about it

and his confirmation hearing President

Trump said he's working with you and a

replacement plan for the ACA which is

nearly finished and will be revealed

after your confirmation is that true

it's true that he said that yes it's

funny because the present life with all

the time with no repercussion is that

that I see what the job will not be

happy oh if you need any more proof of

how unprepared Republicans are right now

let me show you one of the draft bills I

circulated it is just seven pages long

and it ends abruptly with the word

placeholder and one member of Congress

actually tried to spin that as a

positive

just placeholder provides the clearest

signal yet that we're working with

patients and health care groups to draft

language that balances important health

status protections with necessary risk

mitigation tools oh please if your

spouse go to a birthday card that said

placeholder

that would not be a signal they're

working on the best language to express

their feelings for you if we signal they

forgot your birthday the Kabuki

showering from the office and deep down

I think you actually know that the best

sense we currently have what Republicans

want to do is from previous plans from

both price and Paul Ryan and from these

talking points that Ryan gave out ahead

of the congressional recess you're going

to be hearing a few phrases from this a

lot in the coming months so let's take a

moment to understand what they actually

mean and let's start with the big one

which Ryan has been talking up a great

deal what we believe is the right way to

go which is what our plan is our

refundable tax credits for people to go

be able to buy affordable coverage yes

responsible tax credits basically free

money to help pay your premiums which is

a little surprising coming from Paul

Ryan a man who probably takes wages by

writing on the check finder jobs and

market has DS has more value but but you

should know this document suggests tax

credits will be based on age not income

meaning theoretically sixty one-year-old

billionaire Bill Gates will give a

bigger subsidy than a 27 year olds

making minimum wage and Gates clearly

does not need that money you'll just

blow it on more ten dollar haircuts and

orthopedic sweaters so the real risk

here is subsidies ending up too small

for those who need them the most Tom

Price once proposed a credit of twelve

hundred dollars to people's aged

eighteen to thirty five and three

thousand dollars to people 50 and up

which is roughly a third of the cost of

the most bare-bones plans on the market

today a tax credit that small helps

cover your health insurance the way a

song covers your dad's are it doesn't

and there's something that is

fundamentally wrong about that now

now the next big come in here is health

savings account or HSA s

tax-free accounts where you can save

money to pay for health care costs

Republicans love these things in your

experience why do these savings account

what why are you pushing so hard for

them why do you think the respective

because you're spending your own money

as opposed

it's like when my daughter goes to the

mall with my credit card or when I go to

the mall with my credit card our

purchases come back quite different okay

selling aside that healthcare is nothing

like shopping at the mall shouldn't you

come back with different purchases than

your daughter regardless of whose credit

card you have if you came back to mall

with a tongue ring a bottle of Manic

Panic hair dye and a gas queen crop top

it was raise a lot of questions having

nothing to do with health care yep the

King problems with HFA's should be

obviously if they're great for rich

people they're basically a tax shelter

but if you're too poor to fade or you

get sick enough to blow through what you

face you're not going to be covered and

you have that song problem again and

people seem to understand that just

looking the reaction when Joni Ernst try

bringing them up at a town hall mental

savings account

that is an appropriate reaction when

your problem is I don't have enough

money and the proposed solution is well

if you ever do is a very fancy piggy

bank so so let's move on to another key

idea block grants a phrase perfectly

designed to bore you because it combines

block the most nothing shape with grant

your co-workers nothing boyfriends I

don't believe we've met

yes we have six times I'm grant Paul

Ryan wants to use block grants to fund

Medicaid which largely provide health

care to be poorest Americans basically

he wants to stop guaranteeing to pay

each state a percentage of their

Medicaid costs and instead just send

them a fixed block of money but it costs

start to rise and the Block Grant

doesn't keep pace guess what it's that

song songs the song song song and you

should know a few years ago Ryan

proposed a block grant program that a

study estimated could kick as many as

twenty and a half million people off

Medicaid over a decade that's a kind of

evil so chilly we burn all you just

don't see it coming it's like if you

found out that grant was a serial killer

I kill in plain sight for non can

remember my face I am grant we've now

met seven times now let's move on to the

final big talking point here and I'll

let Paul Ryan explain we believe that

state high-risk pools are a smarter way

of guaranteeing coverage for people with

pre-existing conditions yes high-risk

pools now they may sounds like something

you find at Jeremy pivens house but what

they actually do is isolate the sickest

people in their own insurance group now

in theory this brings everyone else's it

area insurance rates down but there is

an obvious problem here again those

pools are going to be incredibly

expensive which is fine if the

government subsidizes them properly but

if it doesn't that's right it's song

o'clock everybody because three years

ago a study estimated that adequately

funding high-risk pools just to maintain

Obamacare levels of coverage would cost

around one hundred and seventy eight

billion dollars a year

guess how much Tom Price set aside three

billion

over three years that is one 178 of what

is needed imagine you asked for 178

pounds of grade a premium hunk but

instead of Chris Evans someone brought

you six of his severed toes but on

crisis plan is six severed hunk shows so

so those are the four big bullet points

but perhaps the most revealing thing

about this document is not what's inside

it but what is not in there because

there is no replacement for the

individual mandate Obamacare's

requirement that you have insurance or

pay a penalty and it is the thing that

people hate the most the individual

mandate is unconstitutional we got to

get rid of the individual mandate I

believe that is a freedom killing part

of the Affordable Care Act out the gate

that should be repealed get rid of the

individual mandate who's got two thumbs

and hates the individual mandates this

guy but but the mandate keeps

younger healthier people in the system

which is crucial to lower the cost for

everyone else and to keep in popular

provisions like among other things not

punishing fat babies the Republican

solution is to make it really painful

for you to get insurance again if you

drop it at any point for any reason they

use the positive sounding term

continuous coverage incentive but it has

to involve some kind of penalty maybe a

higher premium or even denial of

coverage and they are not keen to talk

about details bear remember the

placeholder from earlier that was in

place of an explanation of the

continuous coverage incentive basically

this is a subject so toxic they'd rather

just go abruptly silent much like when

you're a white person singing karaoke

and you realize oh oh we have an n-word

coming up

so Republicans are in a real bind here

they need a plan and food and what price

and Ryan have given them some Farsi to

shift costs from the government's to the

people and from the healthy to the sick

and fewer people are going to be covered

so good luck fixing that Republicans oh

and there's actually one more problem

here because you remember how much

you gave President Obama for saying you

can keep your doctor let me remind you

what Donald Trump has promised that you

are going to do everybody's got to be

covered this is an unrepeated a say no

no the lower 25% they can't afford

private but universal health care I am

going to take care of everybody I don't

care if it cost me votes or not

everybody's going to be taking care much

better than taking care of now who pays

for it

the government is going to pay for it

but we're going to save so much money on

the other side but for the most part

it's going to be a private plan and

people are going to be able to go out

and negotiate great plans with lots of

different competition with lots of

competitors with great companies and

they can have their doctors they can

have their plans they can have

everything they can have everything

period

so anything short of that is a disaster

and insurers are going to need an answer

soon Republican so tick-tock

- you don't get to sleep

over you're right out of this one

that the prospect
of talking about Trump yet again

feels exhausting.

We're all so tired of him,
every room in America

should have a sign
on the wall that counts

the number of minutes
that it's been

since someone brought up
his fucking name.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-But-- But that is the thing.

Trump's presidency
is like one of his handshakes.

It pulls you in,
whether you like it or not.

He's had so many
terrible moments this year,

you probably forgot about
many of them.

Remember when he creepily told
the French president's wife

-that she was in good shape?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Or-- Or when his
tacky golf resort was touted

on the States Department
website?

Or, when he shoved
the prime minister

of Montenegro out of the way,
 at a NATO event.

Look how proud
 of himself he is!

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Look how proud he is!

You should at least have to know
that Montenegro is a country

before making a move that says,
"Suck it, Montenegro."

And there were also quieter
but no less alarming moments

like when he explained how hard
he's been fighting

to bring "clean coal" back
without appearing to understand

what that actually is.

It's just been announced

that a second
brand new coal mine

where they're going
to take out clean coal,

meaning they're taking
out coal,

-they're gonna clean it,
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

is opening in the state
of Pennsylvania.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Listen, is it possible

that Trump is well-versed
in and is referring to

flue gas desulfurization,
fluidized bed combustion,

and selective
catalytic reduction?

Sure, it's possible,

but let's agree
it's considerably more likely

that he thinks you just
take a bunch of coal

and scrub-a-dub it
with a big ol' sponge.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Oh, yeah, that's right.

I'm saying the president
fundamentally doesn't understand

what he's talking about,
and you know what that means.

-We got him!
-(AIR HORN BLARING)

-♪ (PRESIDENTIAL
THEME SONG PLAYING) ♪
-We got him! We got him!

I got him-- wha--
I didn't get him?

-Did I not get him?
-♪ (MUSIC FLUBS OUT) ♪

I thought-- I thought--
I thought we got him.

I thought-- I thought we got him
that time.

Well, that's fair-- okay.

What? You think I don't
hate myself, too? Alright!

-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-The point is--

The point is tonight...
let's pull back

from the daily
Trump-induced chaos

and take a look at the norms
that his presidency

has violated,
and not the obvious ones,

like the fact that he never
released his tax returns,

or that his own daughter
and son-in-law

work in the White House,
although, admittedly,

I am using the word "work"
there so generously

that I should be able
to deduct it

as a charitable donation
on my taxes.

Or-- Or that instead
of putting his assets

into a blind trust to help
reduce conflicts of interest,

he simply showed America

that he has many
large stacks of paper,

presumable containing
the sentence

"I can't believe
I'm getting away with this,"

printed 750,000 times.

No, instead, we're going
to talk about Trump's assault

on something even more basic,
the norms governing

how our leaders engage
with us,

and how in turn,
that affects the way

that we engage with one another.

It's why even the notion
of "getting him"

can feel so hopelessly futile.

And let's first stipulate
that it definitely doesn't help

that so often what Trump says
is complete nonsense.

We often read transcripts
of Trump's speeches,

and it's something
that everyone should actually do

once in a while,
because when you strip away

his blindly confident
entertaining delivery

and just read his words,
it is staggering

how incoherent he is.

Here is a word-for-word
reading of a speech

where he talked about
the Iran nuclear deal.

(MONOTONE VOICE READS
ON-SCREEN TEXT)

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-(READING CONTINUES)

-(AUDIENCE CACKLING)
-Holy shit.

That is not a functional use
of language,

that is a drunk driver
crashing a pick-up truck

-full of alphabet soup.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Trump's actual speech patterns

sound like when you write
a long text

by choosing only
the predictive text

your iPhone suggests for you.

Seriously, we wrote
a message like that,

starting with the words,
"the nuclear,"

and here is what we got.

(MONOTONE VOICE READS
ON-SCREEN TEXT)

-(AUDIENCE CACKLING)
-That makes exactly as much,

and potentially more sense,
then Trump's speech

about the Iran nuclear deal,
meaning an iPhone

would be a more coherent
president of the United States.

But with Trump,
we are familiar enough

with his speech patterns
that you get the basic gist

of what he's trying to say.

The real damage isn't
in how he says things,

but from three key techniques
that he uses to insulate himself

from criticism and consequence.

And if we are not
extremely careful,

all three could have
serious impacts

that far outlast his presidency,

and let's start
with the first one.

Delegitimizing the media.

Now, Trump has been
attacking the press

since he declared
his candidacy,

and in a broader sense,
he's been waging war

on the very concept of truth

ever since he first
turned to his mom and said,

"Dada," and she said,
"No, I'm mama,"

and he said, "Fake news,"
and shit his pants.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now--

the difference now is,
he's crying fake news

as President
of the United States,

and he is openly proud of it,

to the point that he recently
tried to take ownership

of the term itself.

The media is... is--
really the word--

I think one of the
greatest of all terms

I've come up with is "fake."

I guess other people
have used it perhaps

over the years,
but I've never noticed it.

-(AUDIENCE GROANING)
-He just took credit

for inventing the term
"fake news,"

which, for the record,
he did not,

meaning what he just said

was technically
"fake" fake "news" news.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

A-- And you can imagine
him saying, "Well,

I'm not the first politician
to criticize the press.

What about Hillary Clinton?

What about Barack Obama?

What about Bernie Sanders?

And that actually brings us
to Trump's second technique,

something called
"whataboutism."

It's the practice
of changing the subject

to someone else's
perceived wrongdoing.

Now, Trump does this
all the time,

most famously when he was asked

why he hadn't forcefully
condemned the neo-Nazis

in Charlottesville,
and this was his response...

What about the alt-left
that came charging

at the-- as you say,
the alt-right?

Do they have any
semblance of guilt?

What about the fact
they came charging--

that they came charging
with clubs in their hands,

swinging clubs?

Do they have any... problem?

Well, actually, no,
because a Nazi killing someone

with a car is so heinous,

any other issues that might
be up for debate,

under any other circumstances,
kind of have to wait their turn.

You can be wearing Crocs
with socks,

but if you're using
those socked-Crocs

to kick Hitler in the balls,
do you know what?

I'm suddenly not
so fucking focused

-on the footwear.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Now-- Now this technique
of saying "what about..."

is actually an old Soviet
propaganda tool,

and the reason it is dangerous
is because it implies

that all actions,
regardless of context,

share a moral equivalency,
and since nobody is perfect,

all criticism is hypocritical

and everybody should do
whatever they want.

It is a depressingly
effective tool,

which is why,
on Trump's favorite network,

you hear it all the time.

The mainstream media
focused on the Trump campaign

and allegations
of collusion with the Russians.

But what about the Democrat's
possible ties to Moscow?

FEMALE ANCHOR:
Former national security adviser

General Michael Flynn,

investigated for
his private meeting with Russia,

but what about Hillary Clinton?

The media wants to call
into question the credibility,

uh, and the trustworthiness
of this administration, uh,

but what about Benghazi?
What about the blatant lies

that the Obama
administration told us?

What about the fact that
Ben Rhodes bragged

about lying to the media
and the public

-about the Iran deal?
-HANNITY: Great point.

What about the fact that
Jonathan Gruber

basically said the
American people were stupid?

Okay, stop, stop, stop,
because here is the thing,

none of the errors those people
may have made in the past

excuse the Trump
administration's actions.

A defense attorney could not
stand up in court and say,

"Maybe my client did
murder those people,

but I ask you this...
What about Jeffrey Dahmer?

-What about Al Capone?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

What about the guy from
the Silence of the Lambs?

I rest my case here, people.
I rest my case."

The problem with whataboutism
is it doesn't actually

solve a problem
or win an argument.

The point is just to
muddy the waters

which can make
the other side mad,

and that actually
brings us to Trump's

third technique... trolling.

Now trolling itself
has been around for years.

It's basically 80% of what
happens on the internet.

It's-- it's when a
YouTube commenter

says something
willfully provocative

like saying, "I've aged like
an apple core in a dumpster."

or that I "look like a fucking
pickle with glasses."

Now, it doesn't matter
whether they mean any of that,

the point is just to
get a reaction

and to hurt my feelings
which, by the way,

it absolutely does.

But-- But Trump... Trump may
well be the first ever troll

to be elected president.
And that's right,

I said elected.

Remember tenth president,
Sprinkles Fuzzwizard?

He assumed office after
William Henry Harrison died

and if you're thinking,
"Hold on,

Sprinkles Fuzzwizard was not
America's tenth president"...

Really?

Who was America's
tenth president?

Exactly. Let's assume
I'm right.

The point is, as a troll,
Trump often does things

that have no effect
other than

to piss off
his perceived enemies.

Like when he tweeted
this wrestling GIF

of himself
body slamming CNN,

or attacked Mika Brzezinksi
by saying she was,

"bleeding badly
from a face-lift,"

or, as we mentioned
earlier tonight,

called a leader
with nuclear weapons

"short and fat."

And Trump even once
retweeted a claim

that he was the most
superior troll

on the whole of Twitter,
calling it

"a great compliment."

Which it is not,
because sometimes

when you do something that
makes a lot of people mad,

it's because,
and bear with me here,

-you're a dick.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

If you-- If you sneak
into someone's house

and urinate
in every heating vent

and they get mad at you,
you're not an epic troll

sticking it to the
snowflake cucks,

you're just
some fucking asshole.

But the thing is,
Trump's trolling

is not actually without
political value.

Despite Trump's few real policy
accomplishments to date,

he has consistently achieved
one thing,

and that is making
his enemies unhappy.

And for many Trump supporters,
that itself counts

as a major victory.

Just listen to how
 Fox & Friends reacted

after Trump freaked
people out

by standing
with military leaders

during rising tensions
with North Korea,

and suggesting that it was
the "calm before the storm."

I feel like he's trolling
the media.

He is-- I think he's totally
trolling the media there.

You do something like that--
even the smile and the wink.

Those of us that are sick
of the status quo,

the forgotten men and women
who voted for President Trump,

want that town to freak out.
I want those reporters going,

"What do you mean?
What do you mean?"

It's beautiful to watch.

Is it?

Why?
I'm genuinely serious.

Who benefits from mass confusion
about whether or not

we're about to go to war?

Are there thousands of
unemployed factory workers

across the Midwest going,
"Well the plant closed down

and I lost my healthcare.
But somewhere,

a Washington Post reporter
is scared of dying,

so things are looking up. Mega!"

Judging your political success
on how bad you make

other people feel
makes just about as much sense

as judging your success
as a zookeeper

by how many bears you fuck.

Oh, wow, that is not
your job.

I mean, I guess it's impressive
in its own way,

but it is definitely not what
you're supposed to be doing.

And the surest proof of trolling
often comes

when a troll is confronted.

Because that's when
they have to either

put up or shut up.

You may have heard about
cases where

people tracked down the source
of something awful

that was posted online,
only to find

some sullen fifteen-year-old
who just shrugs and goes,

"Well I don't know why
I wrote that. I just did it.

Stop asking me so many
questions."

Well, that is basically
our president now.

I'll show you.
Remember when Trump said

that Obama had surveilled him
in Trump Tower, tweeting...

"How low has President Obama
gone to tap-p my phones?"

Watch what happens when he
was asked to justify that.

Well, you saw what happened
with surveillance

and I think that was
inappropriate.

-That's the way--
-What does that mean, sir?

Uh, you can figure that out
yourself.

Well I-- The reason I ask
is you said he was--

You called him "sick and bad."

Look, you can figure it out
yourself,

he was very nice to me
with words, but--

and when I was with him,
but after that

there has been no relationship.

But you stand by that claim
about him?

I don't stand by anything.
I just, uh...

You can take it the way
you want.

Okay, so let's walk through
what just happened there.

On the internet he claimed
that his predecessor

committed an extremely
serious crime.

But in person, he is suddenly
backing down.

First saying Obama was
"very nice to me with words,"

then that, "I don't stand
by anything."

Which is one of the most

frighteningly nihilistic
sentences a president can say.

I would honestly rather
hear that

from a clown holding a knife
than a president.

Because at least when
a clown says,

"I don't stand by anything,"
you think,

"Yeah, that kind of makes sense.
Please make it quick."

-And...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

And look, it gets worse, because
that interview kept going

and Trump was explicitly
given the opportunity

to set the record straight
for the "fake news media,"

but he flat-out refused.

I just wanted to
find out that--

You're the president
of the United States,

you said he was "sick and bad"

-because he attacked you--
-You can take it any way--

You can take it any way
you want.

-But I'm asking you, because you
don't want it to be fake news.
-You don't--

-I want to hear it from
President Trump.
-You don't have to ask me.

-You don't have to ask me.
-Why not?

Because I have my own opinions,
you can have your own opinions.

But I want to know
your opinions.

-You're the president
of the United States.
-Okay. That's enough.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Okay, so...

There is a lot that is
infuriating about that clip.

But Trump going back to his desk
and pretending to work hard

is an objectively funny
thing to do.

That's like your dog
avoiding questions

by pretending to do his taxes.
You never do this,

why would you need
to do it now?

Look, while there is nothing new
about any of these techniques,

they are now coming out
of the Oval Office.

Which not only legitimizes them,
it risks them spreading,

and that, sadly, is happening.

Last month,
Congressman Paul Gosar

used all three techniques.

First, he suggested
in an interview

that the march
in Charlottesville

may have been
a false flag operation

created by the left, which is
pretty troll-y behavior.

And when confronted about it,
he deployed the other two tools.

-It's all been debunked.
-It's not been debunked.

Absolutely not debunked
whatsoever.

-So stay tuned.
-The conspiracy theory

that you have put out there
has been debunked.

It has not been debunked.
Look at-- Look at what CNN

has talked about with, uh,
with what's going on

with the Clinton administration
right now with the dossier.

Hardly an aspect
in regards to debunk.

You're not real news,
you're fake news.

Sir, everything you've said
has been debunked,

why are you continuing
to put this out there?

So he's basically just
copying Trump.

And if there is one thing
worse than something terrible,

it's a cover band
of that terrible thing.

If Trump is Nickelback,
that man is Bickleknack.

Not as good at it
as the original,

and a horrible sign
that the disease is spreading.

The problem is
if that becomes

the level of discourse
in this country,

we are seriously
and lastingly fucked.

And just this week,
we saw some of these techniques

pushed to the absolute limit
by the scandal involving

Alabama Senate candidate
Roy Moore,

who has denied allegations
of sexual misconduct

with a 14-year-old
when he was 32

and called them "fake news."

Now, watch Sean Hannity
then use whataboutism

to derail
a discussion about it.

This 14-year old girl,
purportedly,

according to
 The Washington Post,

told two of her girlfriends

-what happened in real time.
-SEAN HANNITY: Here's
a tough question...

Do you think Bill Clinton,
in retrospect, was a predator?

But, that is not what this
discussion is about.

You might as well have said,
"Here's a tough question,

'If you had to guess,
how many lobsters are there?'"

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-"Like total? In the world?"

Is that worth discussing?
Sure, but first let's finish

talking about
the Senate candidate

who may have made sexual
advances on a child.

And, look, whether Clinton
engaged in predatory behavior

is absolutely a legitimate
question, but

it shouldn't really inform
what we do about Roy Moore.

And, even if you believe
the Democrats are guilty

of a double standard,
the solution is not to have

no standard whatsoever.

That is why it's so important
to train ourselves to identify

these techniques because their
natural endpoint

is the erosion of our ability
to decide what's important,

have an honest debate, and hold
one another accountable.

And that erosion
could be so gradual

that it's difficult to spot.

It's like being murdered
by a sloth.

It happens very slowly
and you might not notice

-until it's too late.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Now, listen, this is all
very bleak.

I cannot pretend that it isn't,

which is why it is so important
to take some hope

from this year's small victories
like the Muslim ban

being blocked by the courts
after massive public protests.

-(AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS)
-Or, or, the attempts...

to appeal Obamacare stalling,

thanks in part to people
pressuring their lawmakers.

And, just this week,
just this week in Virginia,

voters rejected Ed Gillespie
for governor

after he ran a Trump-style,
dog-whistle campaign.

And that is encouraging
because it's nice to know that

if you use Trump tactics

in a Virginia gubernatorial
election,

you do not get
to be "gubernator."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Now...

further down the ballot there,

Tuesday also marked the defeat
of Bob Marshall,

who earlier this year proposed
a so-called bathroom bill.

He lost to Danica Roem,
who will now be Virginia's

first openly transgender
legislator.

And the tone that she has taken
is already markedly different.

Danica, you were running
against, um, Robert Marshall,

an incumbent,
thirteen-term incumbent.

He's also a man who referred
to himself

as "Virginia's chief homophobe."

He refused to debate you
 during the campaign.

Do you have anything
you wanna say to him?

Come January, delegate Marshall
will be one of my constituents

and I'm not gonna disrespect
my own constituents.

Wow, that is incredibly
refreshing.

Just think about that.

She beat a man who openly
disrespected her,

but given the opportunity,
she chose not to respond

by tweeting...

(READS TWEET)

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

It's nice! It's nice not
to have that.

And, look, Tuesday's results
should not make you complacent.

They are absolutely no
guarantee that the midterms

will turn out at all well.

That is why, though,

you should take these moments
of encouragement

to help you keep going.

Because the Trump Presidency
is basically a marathon.

It's painful, it's pointless,
and the majority of you

didn't even agree to run it.

You were just signed up by
your dumbest friend.

And-- And the fact is

we are not even at mile six
right now,

or possibly even mile three.

So, there is a long way to go,

and though you're exhausted
and your whole body

is screaming for you to give up,
and your nipples are chafing

for some reason,
the stakes are too high

for any of us to stop.

And, I do realize that
I'm saying that

as we're about to stop doing
shows for the year.

But-- But here's the thing,

we won't actually
be going away entirely.

You might remember
earlier this year,

we used our "Catheter Cowboy"
to try and get information

to the president in the
ad breaks of Fox & Friends.

Well, Trump is still watching
that show and we know this

because The Times wrote
a generally negative piece

about its enormous
influence on him.

And because of that called it

"...the most powerful TV show
in America."

A sentiment that the hosts
were very excited about.

This program,
the program you're watching,

is, according to
 The New York Times,

"...the most powerful TV show
in America."

-TUCKER CARLSON: Wow!
-AINSLEY EARHARDT:
Do you know why Steve?

Because we have
the best viewers.

Yes.

-No.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

No, you don't. Uh,
you-- you absolutely don't.

Oh, an-- and look,
don't misunderstand,

I'm not saying that we have
the best viewers.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)
-No, no. I'm not saying that.

No! I'm explicitly
not saying that.

You guys... are fine.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

The best audience belongs
to Ellen because this

is how they greet her...

 Ellen DeGeneres.

-(AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS)
-♪ (MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

None of you fuckers did that

-when I came out.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERS LOUDLY)

None of you did it!

But, the point is,
the point here is,

just 45 minutes after that
information was on Fox,

Trump tweeted...

(READS TWEET)

So information goes right
from that show

into his brain,
which is terrible.

Because we would genuinely be
better off if Trump was getting

daily briefings
from an actual fox

and his friends,
a hedgehog and a weasel

with its head stuck
in a tin can.

But, if Trump is going to keep
watching that show,

we are going to spend
our hiatus

sneaking information
through our Catheter Cowboy.

So-- so a number of commercials
are going to be airing

on Fox News over
the next few months.

Here is the first one...

NARRATOR: Attention
 catheter patients...

I'm a professional cowboy.

I use catheters and there's
two things I know.

I don't like pain when I "cath"
and the term "clean coal"

doesn't refer to the physical
act of cleaning coal,

that would be impossible.

Coal is coal. Clean coal is a
marketing term the coal industry

came up with for stuff like

carbon capture
and sequestration,

an expensive process that's
shown limited results at best.

Also, Frederick Douglass
is dead.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-More tomorrow. Bye-bye.

-(AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS)
-That's good information
for him to know.

That will be on Fox in the D.C.
area later this week.

And keep an eye out
for more of them,

because that cowboy has got
a bunch up his sleeve.

The U.S. Virgin Islands
has a governor,

not a president.

Here's a fun fact...

There's actually no federal law
against this,

thanks to something called
the "First Amendment."

Just because Jared Kushner
is smarter than you,

doesn't mean that he's smart.

The Navy Seals
aren't actually seals.

I know buddy.
I was disappointed, too.

There are many non-gold

of all the food produced in the United

States never gets eaten Americans throw

away 165 billion dollars worth of food

every year that's about 20 pounds per

enough food every year to fill 730

Americans are throwing out a third or

more of our food and the amount we throw

out has increased by around 50% since

the 1970s at this rate in 40 years when

kale here we got broccoli in the back as

well we have plenty of produce to make a

salad here oh not just a salad you could

make a significantly better salad than

the salads they actually sell at

McDonald's which look like the trimmings

in Ronald McDonald's lawnmower mixed

with grimace ejaculate and the thing is

watching all that food go from farm to

not a table is awful for a bunch of

reasons first and most obviously there

are many people in this country who

needs that food in 2013 nearly 50

million Americans lived in food-insecure

households meaning that at some point in

the year they struggled to put enough

food on the table and the fact that we

throw away a third of our food gets

pretty alarming when you hear from some

of those people that's hard I'll go

without food before my kids will budget

down to the penny in it

it's not enough yeah it brings you the

tears yeah it's just hard they're so

young and it's hard it is crazy that

that is happening in a country with 730

football stadiums full of uneaten food

it's insane but there are also other

less obvious consequences to discarding

food for a start

we're wasting all the labor and natural

resources that went into making it and

at a time when the landscape of

California is shriveling up like a

pumpkin in front of a house with a lazy

dad it seems especially unwise the

farmers are pumping water into food that

ends up being used as a garnish for

landfills because those landfills go on

to cause problems of their own

if you were to throw an apple corer or

just out into the woods it's not a big

deal problem comes when all of that

waste is aggregated and it decomposes

without air in a landfill that anaerobic

condition is what creates methane which

is a greenhouse gas that's more than 20

times as potent as co2 at trapping heat

that's right when we dump food into a

landfill we're essentially throwing a

trash blanket over a flatulent food man

and Dutch oven in the entire planet and

if you're thinking but but hold on John

what if I'm an asshole who couldn't give

a about America's hungry families

or the long-term viability of life on

Earth well first let me say mr. Trump

thank you so much for taking the time

secondly there is a selfish financial

reason for you to care about this story

- in our households were wasting

somewhere between 15 and 25 percent of

the food that we're buying you know

that's expensive

I mean imagine walking out of a grocery

store with four bags of groceries

dropping one in the parking lot and just

not bothering to pick it up and that's

essentially what we're doing in our

homes today and that's not good when

you're throwing away that much food

you're not just being wasteful you're

wining and dining raccoons oh this is

absolutely lovely thanks for this we

needed a break from the kids it's a good

thing so many of us have access to

plenty of relatively inexpensive food I

love the fact that we live in a country

with Cap'n Crunch peanut butter crunch

chocolatey crunch sprinkled donut crunch

cinnamon roll crunch Christmas crunch

and Halloween crunch I will even defend

oops or berries crunch a cereal so

unnecessary that its actual name

includes an apology for its existence

but it does seem it does seem like our

food wastage is getting to a critical

mass and so much of it stems from our

own habits and misconceptions

for instance stores big and small often

routinely overstock so that you can walk

in and see tons of food there because if

they don't do that as this small farm

stand operator describes it we might not

buy anything

and there was an hour left in the market

that one bunch of charge would sit there

and no one would buy it but if I had 30

bunches of charge of--like bursting out

I probably sell like 25 verses in charge

so what is that saving people are

totally imposters and they think if

there's one that there's something wrong

it's true I wouldn't buy that child

partly because it's charge but mainly

because we naturally assume the last

option is a bad option which in many

contexts is absolutely the case for

example you don't want the last magazine

in the doctor's office because it's

always Golf Digest always and no one has

ever read Golf Digest that's not even a

golf club in his hand but no one noticed

because it's on Golf Digest but when it

comes to produce the last option is

probably completely fine especially

because as another farmer explains even

slightly subpar fruits and vegetables

don't make it to the produce aisle every

time that the people are picking they'll

have a few they throw on the ground

because there's always a few that aren't

quite perfect this is a perfectly good

peach right on the ground like this oh

my god if you just look down this way

it's like a bounty look at that and the

reason that happens is that if a peach

doesn't meet strict aesthetic standards

it might not be worth a farmer even

trying to sell it our produce oils have

become a lot like Leonardo DiCaprio's

penis exclusively accessible to the

physically flawless

body-shaming is actually so ingrained

it's reflected in the USDA's grading

standards just look at the visual

grading standards for peaches this is a

number one peach and of course it is

that's an undeniably beautiful peach oh

I want to buy that peach dinner and

it whereas whereas embrace yourself this

is a number-2 peach and that is an

abomination unto the Lord and as soon as

it is labeled a number two it can lose

two-thirds of its market value to a

farmer even though its contents are the

same and many retailers have standards

even more strict than the USDA s all of

which is why so many peaches end up

being thrown on the ground to rot and

that should not be how we treat our

fruit it should only be how we treat our

celebrities so help me God Channing

Tatum you lose one muscle fiber on that

six-pack and I will personally toss you

into Hollywood's landfill you keep it

tight Tatum hashtag keep it tight tater

we don't just reject food because of how

it looks sometimes we do it out of pure

fear according to one estimate 91% of us

have thrown out food that's past its

sell-by dates because we're afraid it's

not safe and I am absolutely part of

that 91%

we're weirdly reverent towards these

dates even when they make no sense

use buy sell buy and nothing but just

that date and this is all the same brand

this is all the same brand this is not

only the same brand but also the same 2%

show us this shows there's a complete

confusion out there the only labels on

food more meaningless than those are the

ones on Smirnoff bottles that say triple

distilled vodka really Smirnoff so you

ran the potato sweats through the tube

sock two extra times thanks for spending

the effort we naturally assume sell by

dates reflect a uniform standard of

safety but that is not true well

actually there's nothing to do a safety

at all it's just a manufacturers best

guess of wine that food is gonna be the

freshest and at the best quality exactly

those dates are decided on by

manufacturers and if I were a food

manufacturer I would make those dates as

tight as possible to convince people to

buy a new one of my products because

unlike apple I can't just create a new

operating system that suddenly means

your old cereal is incompatible with

your mouth the truth is with the

exception of baby formula the federal

government does not require any food to

carry an expiration date and state laws

vary widely with nine states not

requiring any date labels at all which

means most of the time sell by dates are

one of those things that look official

but you can probably ignore like a child

in a cop uniform just to stop it Tyler

are not under a West you are under a

West

but because we think those dates are

real many supermarkets throw expired

food out even before its sell-by date

and they don't donate it for what they

think is a pretty good reason

everything that's closed dated or any

calls no we can't you can't it's a

safety you can't if you guys donate it

then or you don't donate it so if it was

straight in the garbage they go straight

in the garbage history losses have you

guys been sued before that's a common

misconception we all think that if you

donate food and someone gets sick if you

get sued I thought that until earlier

this week but we looked into it and

couldn't find a single case where a food

donor has been sued it doesn't happen

it's a false fear like believing if you

go in the water after eating you'll get

a cramp and drown yeah it turns out that

isn't true either this week has blown my

mind because the system is if you donate

food to a charity you're covered by the

Emerson Act which says you cannot be

sued if you make a food donation in good

faith you presumably get the same cover

with donating clothes even though in

some cases there you really should be

sued donating a cowl-neck sweater hello

the homeless live in shelters not for

2008

Oh

yes here's the problem even if more

people understood that there would still

be food that doesn't get to people who

need it for a critical reason

Harold McClure D of HMC farms says he'd

like to donate more of his peaches to

the food banks but getting it into the

hands of somebody to eat it isn't isn't

free there's got to be an economic

incentive to move more of this into an

avenue that food banks couldn't take

advantage of it's a lot easier and

cheaper just to base it throw it away

and that may be the biggest issue of all

for businesses donating food is

genuinely expensive you've got to box it

store it coordinate deliveries for it

there's a lot of overheads

and you cannot fault companies for

caring about their bottom line in the

same way you can't fault a dog for

caring about licking its balls

it's what dogs do it's natural and dog

balls are delicious companies in their

defense are not charities which is why

they should be incentivized to donate

food with tax breaks large corporations

already get one but annoyingly that same

break for small businesses is not a

permanent part of the tax code meaning

that Congress has to keep renewing it

and that's a problem because family

farms or local restaurants may not know

if they're going to get that break at

the end of the year and therefore

whether donating food will be

financially viable for them it's a

ridiculous system which problem prevents

a lot of food from being donated so here

is the good news in February this year a

congressman proposed HR 640 for the

fighting hunger incentive Act to make

that tax break permanent here actually

is one of the bill's sponsors it's time

to get rid of these short-term fixes

embrace long-term solutions this

legislation simply makes the provisions

permanent and when you think about it

that's important because when

something's not permanent it affects our

behavior that's what we all treat rental

cars like we're in a fast and furious

movie I'm sorry sharp turn ahead get

ready to drift Kia Sorento

now now you'll be happy to hear that

bill passed the house however by the

time it did it had been bundled together

with other unpaid for tax breaks and

retitled the America gives more act but

still that original provision was in

there which means this problem has been

solved the show is over we can roll

credits and all live happily ever after

right no not right because when the bill

got to the Senate they and I honestly

did not know this was even possible they

removed everything from inside the bill

retitled it the trade facilitation and

trade Enforcement Act of 2015 and

refilled it with completely different

language concerning border control and

us-israeli relations which meant yes HR

644 passed just with a completely

different title and completely different

contents it's like going to a restaurant

ordering a veggie burger and having the

way to say here you go we made out of

meatloaf and we call it a waffle and

then you can't even say well I don't

want this give it to someone who needs

it because they can't because they don't

know whether or not they'll get a

tax credit for it

the same thing everyone basically agrees

small businesses should get tax

incentives to donate food so we have to

find a way to pass that but even if we

do it will be one small part of what

needs to be a much bigger solution from

and resolving to eat uglier fruit to

taking expiration dates with a pinch of

salt to no longer worrying about getting

sued by high-powered lawyers

representing the hungry

we all have to address our relationship

with food waste or at the very least our

cheeseburger commercials are gonna have

to get a lot more honest what's more

American than a cheeseburger this

cheeseburger loaded with a hot dog and

potato chips in the hands of a model in

a hot tub in a pickup truck on an

aircraft carrier in front of the Statue

of Liberty I'll tell you what's more

American if that cheese burgers that

thrown away along with 15 other

cheeseburgers in front of a food

insecure family for who frankly cannot

believe their eyes as they stand on top

of 14 tons of perfectly edible if

aesthetically unappealing fruits and

vegetables which in turn sits on top of

80 tons of dairy products all one day

patched their arbitrary sell-by dates

all of which sits inside a tear rolling

down Abraham Lincoln's face on Mount

Rushmore which is now nearly chin deep

and millions of discarded cheeseburgers

all gradually decomposing and emitting

flammable methane

red white and blue that is king of

America I think that this can cost you

in your hardest

you

trait the basic system of barter an

exchange that you have to do really

carefully or you'll end up with Dwight

Howard Syria seriously parents talk to

your children about trade you don't want

to go to school with Peter Lunchables

and coming home with Dwight Howard the

baby's gonna add a three-point shot to

his game now kids grow up no trade trade

is a subject on which our current

president considers himself particularly

expert trade that's what I'm gonna do so

good I'll take those traders and make

them so good that's what I do

I love taking bad deals and making them

good I love trade you know trades always

been my thing I could name ten different

forms of trade I know every one of them

hey the Wharton School of Finance right

here yeah I can name ten forms of trade

there's a free trade fair trade Rough

Trade Trader Joe's that's what eight

then there's human trafficking that's

like trading for people well rounded up

and call it ten Wharton School of

Finance Roy here Thomas talked a big

game on trade for decades and he spent

this year slapping tariffs on products

from China Canada the EU and others

prompting them to retaliate with tariffs

of their own and this trade war has

escalated fast from tariffs on just 18

products at the start of the year to now

over 10,000 so things have gotten pretty

serious and American workers are already

being impacted particularly in

agriculture we're feeling a lot of pain

right now in in the farm sector it's

affecting farmers a negative way I

always hope that one morning president

Trump's just going to wake up and and

send out that 3:30 in the morning tweet

that says tariffs are gone wow that is a

depressing thought so that guy's

livelihood depends on a tweet that says

tariffs are gone and even if Trump does

end up doing that at 3:30 in the morning

you just know it'll say tariffs a goon

and we'll all have to decide what he

meant by that so tonight before things

get much worse let's take a look at this

trade war because it's tempting to think

that Trump has a plan after all trade is

his thing and he's tweeted trade wars

are good and easy to win but for years

his strategy on that seems to have been

based around little more than tone of

voice so easy I drop a 25% tax on China

and

and you know I said to somebody that is

really the messenger the messenger is

important I could have one man say we're

gonna tax you 25% and I could say

another listen your we're

gonna tax you 25% oh I see okay so the

tone is important so if I were to say to

somebody that's not how trade

negotiations work that would be one

thing but if I were to say that's not

how trade negotiations work you're dumb

that would be much more

effective there are some very basic

things about economics that he seems

genuinely confused by take tariffs Trump

wants tweeted that if the trade war

doesn't end other countries will pay us

vast sums of money in the form of

tariffs we win either way but that's not

how tariffs work tariffs are taxes

designed to make foreign goods more

expensive therefore making domestic

products more appealing other countries

don't pay us tariffs importers here too

when they receive the goods and they

usually pass that cost along to the

consumer so when Trump imposes a tariff

on an item you are probably going to pay

more for it as reporters have been

trying to explain in the most literal

way possible here in the kitchen

made in China utensils and appliances

like stoves and refrigerators are being

targeted upstairs in the bathroom

everyday items like shampoo nail

clippers makeup and towels could mean

higher prices for things like instant

coffee and this harley-davidson

motorcycle everyday items like the iPad

could be hid the tablet has a chip from

Intel which could be a target East

Cooter's have taken off this year now

they face a 25% tariff okay I hate to

admit this but if one of the key

casualties of this trade war is e

scooters I actually think I'm fine with

that

well basically is Dane Cook somehow

became transportation

and it's not it's not just tariffs that

Trump seems to misunderstand there's

also our trades deficits basically the

number that expresses how much more we

buy from other countries than they buy

from us Trump talks about it all the

time usually like this our trade deficit

ballooned to 817 billion dollars think

of that we lost 817 billion dollars a

year over the last number of years in

trade in other words if we didn't trade

we'd save a hell of a lot of money okay

okay so there's a lot to unpack there

first our trade deficit is actually 552

billion so he was off by a quarter

trillion dollars water school of finance

right there a second trade deficit

aren't actually always bad and many

economists believe for very complex

reasons involving savings rates and the

dollar special status as the world's

reserve currency that America's trade

balance might be more or less where it

should be and finally and this is

important when we have a trade deficit

we don't lose money it's not a big pile

of cash that we handed over we bought

things that we received and I'm not

saying that it was all valuable does

anyone really need the pony up daddy

saddle which allows your child to

symbolize their newfound dominance over

your life no I didn't need it but I

wanted it and honestly it's brought my

dad and me closer together even the

world leaders that Trump has been

fighting with seem alarmed by how little

he understands trade EU Chief

jean-claude juncker reportedly met Trump

armed with a series of colorful simple

flashcards to explain the trade war and

the work that really gets me there is

colorful because that means that means

that they have some simple flashcards

and thought no too wonky let's get some

big fun baby colors on those things

let's give him a chance and Angela

Merkel struggled to explain something

even more basic the independent

newspaper setting an unnamed senior

German official ten times Trump asked ms

merkel if he could negotiate a trade

deal with Germany every time she replied

you can't do a trade deal with Germany

only the

on the 11th refusal Trump finally got

the message Oh we'll do a deal with

Europe then so he understood but only

after the 11th refusal just listen to

what that sounds like

deal with Europe ha deal with your ha

deal with your ha deal with York ha deal

with your ha

deal with your car deal with your car

[Applause]

deal with your honestly I'm just amazed

that after the fifth time Angela Merkel

didn't turn to our translator and say

okay you're fired you can't

possibly be translating this right I'm

not I am not saying that it's easy to

understand trade it's one of the most

complicated issues there is technically

politically and emotionally over the

years free trade has been criticized

from all sides and people argue that

unfettered trade can reward the worst

behavior of multinational companies and

exploit countries with fewer protections

for labor and that has unquestionably

happened but Trump generally confines

himself to arguing that trade is

responsible for the death of US

manufacturing jobs and while there is

some truth in that automation is the far

bigger culprit we actually still make a

lot of things in America US factories

now manufacture twice as much as they

did in 1984 but they do it with 1/3

fewer workers and the overwhelming

consensus among economists is that trade

between countries generally speaking can

create jobs lower costs and be a net

benefit to both nations essentially

think of trade like sex if you're doing

it right it can be good for both

partners though the odds of that

happening plummet as soon as Donald

Trump gets involved and the problem the

real problem with Trump not

understanding trade is that he therefore

doesn't understand its consequences for

instance one of the first major shots he

fired in this trade war was putting

tariffs on steel and aluminum that was

great news for the people working in

those specific industries like this

worker in a Missouri aluminum plant you

you think that his policies are kind of

why you have a job today I know what is

you know it is yeah I want to have a job

offer if it didn't happen wish I could

meet him and give him big old hug

you know yeah I do know and I honestly

get why he wants to hug him Trump got

him his job back is one of two possible

explanations for that man wanting to hug

Donald Trump but the other of course

being that if during the early stages of

the campaign Trump and Melania were

driving through Missouri on a stormy

night and their car broke down Donald's

not getting out some Melania ends up

climbing out into the rain and opening

the hood as that aluminum worker comes

driving down the highway he rolls down

his window and asks if he can help to

which Melania gratefully asked maybe a

flashlight and just if the aluminum

worker is handing the flashlight over it

gets struck by lightning and they switch

bodies

so now Donald is living in the White

House with an aluminum worker who feels

understandably weird about holding his

hat while Melania is forced to point

after her husband from the factory floor

her heart's aching for him every second

of every day knowing full well that

revealing her true identity would just

complicate things for everyone but

that's Melania you go to him

the world will accept your love that

aluminum worker clearly isn't in love

with him everyone can see it and its

players so much

but that individual guy in that

individual job things have improved but

when it comes to trade nothing happens

in isolation and then there are

downstream effects to those tariffs not

too far from where that guy works there

is an eighth nail factory which suffered

because thanks to Trump steel tariffs

the price of their raw material steel

skyrocketed sales dropped in half and

they've laid off over a hundred workers

and those that remain are worried some

of these people this is the only ink of

their guide just like me this is the

only thing inked up I got and I got to

put another daughter through school you

know it's very hard yeah it is that's

the problem here protecting steel help

steel but it hurts anything made from it

and you have to balance those

consequences by one estimate Trump's

tariffs may create 26,000 jobs in steel

and aluminum but could cost over 400,000

jobs across the rest of the economy so

if trump's trying to create jobs almost

anything would be a better idea than

tariffs he'd be better off dressing a

turtle up like david bowie and throwing

him into a pool full of milk will that

create jobs of course not but it won't

actively lose hundreds of thousands of

them plus it'll be the highlight of

ziggy she'll dusts life and listen

listen we're still only scratching the

surface of how complicated this is

because distinguishing between a foreign

product and an american job can be a lot

trickier than you'd think

take some of trumps favorite villains

when it comes to foreign companies they

sell mercedes and BMW and the cars come

in by the millions and we hardly tax

them at all we can't do this stuff

anymore

we protect Germany Germany who doesn't

have a BMW we're gonna tax Mercedes Benz

we're gonna tax BMW we're gonna tax all

of those beautiful Mercedes Benzes that

are coming in at wicked attacks BMWs

that are coming in Trump is furious with

German cars and here is here's the thing

about that in the clip where he said who

doesn't have a BMW to the crowd in his

classic man-of-the-people way so trunk

is actually in North Augusta

South Carolina and just two hours drive

away is a place called Spartanburg

County

well known for this Spartanburg is home

to the largest BMW plant in the world

last year they made more than 370

thousand luxury SUVs employing 10,000

people pumping billions into the state's

economy yeah it seems Trump didn't know

that look everyone knows he doesn't know

a lot of things but occasionally it's

important to remember that he also

doesn't know anything it's true it's

true I'll show you

everyone close your eyes right now and

think of something that thing you're

thinking of he doesn't know that and

since the trade war began Spartanburg

County is actually double because

they'll be affected by higher costs for

the steel that they use to build the

cars and when they try to ship them to

China

they'll be hit by Chinese tariffs so

they are in complicated trouble or as

Trump might put it listen your

you get in tax twice so so

if a trade war could be this disruptive

and the net benefits are likely to be

this negative why is Trump doing this

especially because members of his own

economic team seem against it Gary Cohn

reportedly left over the proposed

tariffs and Steve minuchin Treasury

secretary and white hot sex bomb has has

tried to do some damage control by

claiming we're not actually in a trade

war at all this has been a trade dispute

all along it never was a trade war it's

a trade dispute oh I get it it's not a

war it's a dispute you know what I

always almost bought that

because I'm so distracted by this

lavaridge sex volcanoes looks the guy's

hypnotic I must have a bad case of the

Manucci 'he's right now because he's

looking like an absolute snack so so who

is who is telling the president that

this is a good idea well by most

accounts the driving force is Peter

Navarro head of the Office of Trade and

manufacturing policy

he's Trump's trade guy isn't that right

Peter I'm the trade guy thanks Peter

so so just just for the record let's all

get our Trump administration role

straight we've got trade guy Lyle ad

nothing boy Jesus please a word ghoul

crime nymph drunk grandpa and daughter

wife it's a it's a well-oiled machine

he's running

now Navarro is the author of a series of

get rich investment books and like Trump

he's obsessed with trade deficits in

general and China in particular saying

trade with China is a zero-sum game

meaning one country can only win if the

other country loses and it is hard to

overstate just how rare his views are

among economists when the New Yorker

profiled him they asked a Varro to help

them find even one colleague who agreed

with him he gave them two names one was

Peter Murray see a University of

Maryland professor who said of Navarro

he has a rather severe position that

zero-sum statement I have a problem with

that

where's his proof and the other was a

blogger named Allen Tolson who Navarro

described as a fine economist to which

Thomson replied I do not hold an

economics degree and I'm guessing

Thomson also doesn't hold a degree in

web design because this is the photo on

the about page of his blog so if you are

understandably wondering at this point

then how on earth did Navarro get a job

at the White House well it is

way dumber than you are thinking

apparently Jared Kushner was tasked with

finding Trump experts on Chinese trade

and this is how he went about it so

Jared went on Amazon

he fired up his computer and he found

some of Peter Navarro's books and he

asked him to come to the White House

that's how Peter Navarro ended up in the

White House yeah Jared looked for

experts on Amazon that was his rigorous

process so when Jeff Sessions does get

fired be prepared for him to be replaced

by crystal kaswell author of the erotic

fiction novel dangerous rock a dangerous

noise novel because for whatever reason

that is honestly the first thing that

came up when we typed good law person

parentheses smart into a bizarre

now the Navarro book that Jarrett found

was called death by China and it paints

the u.s. Chinese trade relationship in

apocalyptic terms because while there

are some legitimate complaints about

China's unfair practices they've

deliberately depressed their currency

they violate intellectual property

rights and arguably skirts WTO rules

this book goes way further with chapter

titles featuring phrases like

shanghaiing the gene pool and look mark

there's a death star pointing at Chicago

and Navarro actually turned the book

into a movie that one critic called the

documentary equivalent of a raving

street corner derelict which seems harsh

until you see how the movie begins the

film you're about to she addresses one

of the most urgent problems facing

America

it's increasingly destructive trade

relationship with a rapidly rising China

it starts like that it's warm up is a

literal knife being stabbed into the

heart of America and if you are worried

that that leaves it with nowhere to go

please don't be concerned because there

are even less subtle animations to come

which depict China's trade practices as

guns and bombs that blow up American

factories and stunningly deceptive

moments like this China has stolen

thousands of our factories and millions

of our jobs multinational corporation

profits are soaring and we now all over

three trillion dollars to the world's

largest communist nation I'm not saying

that that large ball isn't very

convincing but our trade deficit isn't

the same as what we owe to China those

are two different numbers and neither of

them is anywhere close to three trillion

dollars and when something that central

to your movie has something that wrong

with it

you usually have to replace it with

Christopher Plummer so so so Navarro is

not someone who any legitimate

economists take seriously and yet he

seems to be the only person the

president is listening to Trump has

called death by China right on and

lauded its facts figures and insight and

Navarro returns the compliment saying of

his own job that my function really as

an economist is to try and provide the

underlying analytics that confirmed

Trump's intuition and his intuition is

always right and that is simply

terrifying because the economists

shouldn't be finding ways to confirm the

intuitions of someone who doesn't know

what they're talking about it's like a

builder working for a child saying my

job is to build this house he designed

which is shaped like an ice-cream cone

with a window that's also a door and the

size of the Sun and a dog his intuitions

are always right no they aren't you need

to stop that child before someone gets

hurt

in fact if you want to get a sense of

just how little Navarro understands the

game he's playing consider this since

this trade war began

China has imposed 37 billion dollars of

tariffs on the u.s. now take a look at

what Navarro said back in March

are you expecting China to come back

with retaliation I don't believe any

country in the world is going to

retaliate for the simple reason that we

are the most lucrative and biggest

market in the world they know they're

cheating us and all we're doing is

standing up for herself it's just

breathtaking to see someone be that

confident and that wrong he's basically

Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic yelling I'm

king of the world except you're not are

you leo you're just an amateur sketch

artist who's about to be murdered by ice

when you put all of this together what

you're left with is this we're engaged

in an escalating trade war that almost

no legitimate economist supports led by

a man who honestly doesn't seem to fully

understand the mechanics of what he's

doing getting advice from the human

equivalent of an all-caps email from

your uncle and the crazy thing is the

effect of all this is the exact opposite

of what Trump says he wants because if

you want to create jobs you don't do

that by cutting off American companies

markets and suppliers and if you want to

curb the abuses of countries like China

you don't do that by pissing off the

leaders of every other nation on earth

and I know that none of what I'm saying

right now will get through to trump so

so maybe it's time to take a page from

one of the only people he's actually

listening to and give him some basic

economic lessons in the only language he

seems to understand the film you're

about to see addresses one of the most

urgent problems facing America the

destruction of basic economic knowledge

by stupidity and the consequences of it

could be disastrous so let's review a

few fundamental facts first a trade

deficit isn't a giant pool of money that

you've lost to another country that's

idiotic

second if you think you can use tariffs

as a weapon you should understand a

tariff isn't something other countries

pay you it's a tax you're forcing your

own people to pay which might end up

hurting them a lot less than it hurts

you

and third our economy is massively

interconnected and you can't just tamper

with one thing without considering what

the water consequences could be

unfortunately misunderstandings just

keep getting bigger while basic

knowledge is shrinking and the result is

stupidity is increasing at an

unsustainable rate listen economics is

incredibly complicated and at the very

least you'll probably shouldn't find

your key economic adviser on

Amazon and the trade guy because his

could end up seriously hurting

us

[Music]

[Applause]

Before our main story tonight,

I'd like to do something
a little different

and just quickly tell you
about a beloved icon

of my childhood,
and it's this man...

WOMAN: For 20 years he made
 the dreams of young people

come true,

with his hugely popular
Jim'll Fix It program.

Best known for his
 trademark jewelry,

track suits, tinted glasses,
 and Havana cigar.

Now, I know it's
hard to believe,

but that bizarre looking man,
Jimmy Savile,

was a national hero.

We named places for him,
we gave him a knighthood,

we even put up
this statue of him,

even though it clearly looks
more like

a cheese sculpture
of George Carlin

-that someone left in the sun.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Now, he had a show called
 Jim'll Fix It,

where he basically
granted wishes.

And like many British kids,
I actually wrote to him.

I asked him

to make me the mascot
for Liverpool football club,

and he never wrote back.

Which I'm actually glad about,
because after he died,

Britain began to find out
who he really was.

And the truth was horrific.

He's gone from a much loved
entertainer,

and respected charity
fundraiser,

to a man described by
Scotland Yard

as a predatory sex offender.

Jimmy Savile's headstone
 was here

for less than three weeks.

His epitaph read,
 "It was good while it lasted."

Oh!

That is an unsettling thing

to have written
on his gravestone.

Although to be fair,
nearly every famous epitaph

would sound horrifying written
on a sex offender's gravestone.

From Dean Martin's "Everybody
loves somebody sometime,"

to Rodney Dangerfield's
"There goes the neighborhood."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-You know, funny, funny.

But if he'd been
a sex offender,

not so much.

The point is, Savile's
headstone was taken down,

as was that sign,
and that creepy statue,

because once we found out
that he was a monster,

we accepted it was
no longer appropriate

to publicly glorify him.

Which actually brings us
to our main story tonight...

the Confederacy.

America's tracksuit
sex offender.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now, in recent years,

there has been a robust debate
over Confederate symbols.

From flags being taken down,
to statues being removed,

to the white nationalist
rallies in Charlottesville.

Both the one that
ended in violence in August,

and another that happened
just last night.

So as this debate is clearly
not going away,

we wanted to take a look
at some of the arguments.

Because you don't
have to look hard

to find people very upset

at the idea of Confederate
statues being taken away.

You can't change history.

You can't pick and choose
what you decide is history.

I think they oughta
just leave 'em alone

and leave 'em
where they are, you know.

They're part of history.

I just don't think
we can erase our history.

It may not represent
the best idea...

that anybody ever came up with.

But nevertheless,
it's part of our history.

And, uh,
I think it should stay there.

You know what,
I'll give him this, he is right

that the Confederacy
and everything that came with it

is, to put it mildly,
"not the best idea...

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-anybody ever came up with."

Because that of course
is making grilled cheese

on a toaster turned sideways.

That is a billion-dollar idea

that is also
completely worthless.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-But they're also right

about one thing.

We should
remember our history,

so tonight, let's do that.

And let's look at the unique
heritage of these symbols.

Starting with the fact
that there are a lot more

than you might expect.

REPORTER:
The Southern Poverty Law Center

found some 1,500 Confederate
 memorials across the country.

More than 700 of them
 are statues and monuments,

and ten U.S. military bases

are named for
 Confederate officers.

Think about that.

There are U.S. military bases
named for Confederate officers.

And they were the enemy.
They killed U.S. soldiers.

That's like finding out that
Nancy Kerrigan

-named her child Tonya Harding.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Why would you do that?
That's a weird choice.

And tributes to the Confederacy
are everywhere in the South,

and notably some
in the North too.

And that map doesn't include
kitschy ways

that the Civil War is presented,
like at this family restaurant:

ANNOUNCER:
 Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede

brings a rip roaring
 taste of America to life.

Dixie's Stampede
 is a musical extravaganza

of sight and sound.

Centered around a friendly
 North-South rivalry,

friendly servers bring
the delicious four course feast

right to you.

Including a whole
 rotisserie chicken,

and all the Pepsi, iced tea,
 or coffee you like.

Yes. That is
a Confederate soldier

serving a small child
all the Pepsi she likes.

Which is still remarkably

only Pepsi's second worst
ad campaign.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
AND CHEERING)

And the thing is if you grew up
with experiences like that,

it can seem like the Civil War
is just a friendly rivalry.

A fun, colorful part
of U.S. history.

But that omits the key fact
about the Civil War.

The Confederacy was fighting for
the preservation of slavery.

And that's not my opinion,
that is just a fact.

There are many ways
that we know this.

Slavery is mentioned in
multiple state's

declarations of secession

with Mississippi saying,

"Our position
is thoroughly identified

with the institution
of slavery."

The Confederate Constitution
contains a clause

enshrining slavery forever.

And then there's the speech
Alexander Stephens,

the Confederate vice president
gave in 1861,

in which he articulated
the basic principles

for the Confederate nation.

ALEXANDER STEPHENS:
 Its foundations are laid.

Its cornerstone rests upon
 the great truth

that the Negro is not
 equal to the white man.

That slavery, subordination
 to the superior race,

is his natural and
 normal condition.

Wow. Subordination to
the superior race.

That is explicit.

If the Confederacy was not
about slavery,

somebody should really
go back in time

and tell the fucking
Confederacy that.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And yet, remarkably,

many people think the Civil War
was over something else.

REPORTER 2: When people
were asked, "What do they think

the main cause
 of the Civil War is?"

48% said,
 "Mainly about states' rights."

Only 38% said,
 "Mainly about slavery."

Nine percent said "both."

And that is amazing.

Only 38% thought the Civil War
was mainly about slavery.

In other words,
look to your left,

now look to your right,

statistically all three of you
live in a country

where only 38% percent of people

-think the Civil War
was mainly about slavery.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And on that "states' rights"
argument, for the record,

the Southern states were
ardently pro-states' rights.

But with some
glaring exceptions.

Notably, when Northern states

passed laws to help protect
runaway slaves,

the South wanted
the federal government

to override those states laws.

So, they loved states' rights,

as long as they were
the right states' rights.

The wrong states' rights
would be states' wrongs,

wrongs which would
need to be righted

by the right states' rights--
look, to put it really simply,

they just wanted to
own black people,

-and they didn't much care how.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

That's a fact!

But that's a very hard fact
for some people to accept.

Especially if a member
of your family

fought for the Confederacy.

And sometimes,
the understandable desire

to want to distance
your relative from that cause

can lead to people
distorting the cause itself.

Just watch as one man

at a community meeting
in North Carolina

defended a Confederate statue

by talking about
his family history.

My great grandfather
was a Confederate soldier.

And I was proud of that.

Because my opinion of his fight

was for his rights.

I don't know what
his rights were.

I wasn't there.

He was dead long before
I came along.

But I'm really concerned
about our monument.

I want it to stay.

It reminds me that I got
a little rebel in me.

You know, we all want to
kind of be independent.

We all have a little
rebel in us, even the ladies.

-Ooh! Even the ladies!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Hashtag feminism,
hashtag confedera-she.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
-And look, look.

I don't know, I don't know

why his great grandfather
fought.

It is hard to know
the motivations

of any individual soldier.

What we do know is that
again, collectively,

they were fighting to preserve
the institution of slavery.

And I do get, honestly,
I honestly get

wanting a more comfortable
history for your family.

But in doing so,
you can't invent

a more comfortable history
for your country.

Because you would be erasing
the actual painful experiences

of many Americans.

As a fellow North Carolinian
explains.

When I walk by this statue,
I-- it becomes very painful

when I think of the suffering
that my ancestors went through.

They enslaved people.

Abused people for their own
economic impact.

And it should not be
 celebrated by these statues.

Right. And that is
the harsh reality

of what was done by
those Confederate men.

And yes, even the ladies,

-hashtag confedera-she.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

If you want to see
a perfect crystallization

of what happens when
two people have

wildly different views
of the same symbol,

just watch this
local news clip.

Why do you carry that flag?

Because this is my heritage.

My family fought
to save their farm

under this flag.

Who was working that farm?

Ooh!

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING IN DISBELIEF)

That is a good, tough question.

And the news clip
actually cut out there,

but we were so intrigued to
find out what his response was

we tracked it down.

And whatever you are expecting,
you're going to be surprised.

-MAN: Who was working that farm?
-My family was!

-Who was working the farm?
-They were poor,

Do you know how much
a slave cost back then?!

-(AUDIENCE SHOUTING)
-Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

You know you are in the wrong

when you decide
your best argument

is screaming at a black man,

"Do you know how expensive
you used to be?!"

It is--

It is comments like that one

that landed this guy
on the cover of

Holy Shit That Is Not
 Remotely The Point magazine.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And look, that-- that is clearly
an intense example.

But denial of this painful
part of history

can take many forms.

Look at PBS's
 Finding Your Roots,

where Henry Louis Gates
explores

celebrities' family histories,

and he often finds some shit.

Famously, Ben Affleck
pulled strings

to get the show
to remove all references

to his slave-owning ancestors.

And though he later apologized,

that impulse right there
is not good.

Because it sanitizes history.

And while there is no
easy way to respond

to learning that kind of
horrible information,

it is worth watching
Anderson Cooper find out

how one relative of his died.

Boykin was murdered by
a rebellious slave.

Wow.

Your ancestor was
beaten to death

with a farm hoe.

(LAUGHS)
Oh my God.

That's amazing.
This is incredible.

(LAUGHS)

I am blown away.

-You think he deserved it?
-ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah.

-Wow. You know what?
-(AUDIENCE CLAPPING)

You know what,
as a general rule,

just try not to live a life

...that could lead a descendant
of yours to one day say,

"A guy smashed
grand-poppy's head in

with a garden hoe?

That's amazing.
Great job 'That Guy!'"

(LAUGHING)

But, my absolute
favorite response

to a nasty surprise,

undoubtedly
comes from Larry David,

who received
a real one-two punch.

Are you telling me that
my great-grandfather

fought for the South?

In the Civil War?

(LAUGHS) What? Are you kidding?

Oh, my goodness...

I hope no slaves show up
on this--

Please turn the page.

(MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER HOLLERS)

Now, Larry, this is
another part of the 18th--

Oh-- oh, you did it!
You did it!

-I knew it! I knew it!
-(GATES LAUGHING)

-Unbelievable!
-Unbelievable.

Boy.

HENRY LOUIS GATES JR:
That's b-- unbelievable.

Oh boy, oh boy.

-Yeah. Prettay, prettay,
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

pretty bad!

Pretty bad!

And look!

Larry David
is not responsible

for what his ancestors did.

None of us are.

I have to believe that,
because I'm English.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And I would like to go

to an Indian restaurant again
at some point in my life.

(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

But-- but we do have to reckon
personally, and as a country

with what our heritage means.

You can't ignore it like Batman,

you can't say
it's something else

like town meeting Santa,

you've got to actively,
painfully,

come to grips with slavery,

and the lasting benefits
and disadvantages

that if conferred.

In ways that, frankly,
we haven't yet.

And that actually brings us back
to Confederate monuments,

because there is
something about them that

that symbolizes our reluctance
to have that conversation

and that is the dates
that they went up.

Because while some
initial memorials

were built mainly in cemeteries,
shortly after the Civil War,

the real surge came
much, much later.

MALE REPORTER 1:
The Southern Poverty Law Center

says a majority

of the more than 700
 Confederate monuments

in public spaces
 across the country,

were erected decades
 after General Lee's surrender.

It's true, as this chart

of the years that
they were dedicated shows,

there was a big spike
from 1900 to 1920

as white southerners were
re-asserting their dominance

through things like
Jim Crow laws,

uh, with another spike in the
50s and 60s

as the Civil Rights Movement
was gaining steam,

so those statues weren't so much

commemorating
recently fallen dead,

as sending
a pretty hostile message

to African-Americans.

And sending messages is kind of
what statues are often for.

This one says,
"We love freedom."

This one says,

"The most notable thing
about our city

-is a fictional character."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

(STAMMERS) And this one says,
"About yay big."

-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
-We still don't know...

what he was trying to measure,
but whatever it was,

-it was... "About yay big."
-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

But... look, for some
Confederate statues though,

for some Confederate statues
the intent is crystal clear.

In that town meeting
from before,

the statue that
they were debating

was this one, which went up
in 1914

and a leader of
that county's chapter of the KKK

gave a speech at its dedication,

calling the occasion
an opportunity

"To recall the achievements
of the great and good

of our own race and blood."

Which, again, is pretty
on-the-nose right there.

And the largest
Confederate memorial,

the carving on Stone Mountain
in Georgia,

is located where the
20th century KKK was born.

It depicts
three Confederate leaders

on horseback, and
it was completed in 1972,

so that means
there is color footage

of the dedication.

After nearly half a century
of work, the memorial carving

here at Stone Mountain
is finally finished.

And officials are calling it
the eighth wonder of the world.

We must recall those principals
of loyalty, dignity and honor

that shine through
the lives of men

we commemorate today.

Yes. That was
Vice President Spiro Agnew

commemorating the loyalty
of literal traitors.

But, what can you really expect
from a man whose name,

rearranged, spells
"Grow a Penis."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And...

and some-- here's the thing.

Some monuments went up
even more recently.

I-- I wanna show you one

that was erected
on private lands,

but very much for
public consumption.

Because once you see it,
you will not forget it.

MALE REPORTER 2:
The statue was erected in 1998.

It portrays
 Nathan Bedford Forrest

on his horse.

Gun in one hand,
 and sword in the other.

Surrounded by
Confederate state battle flags,

visible for all to see
 on the side of I-65.

(CARS DRIVING BY)

MALE REPORTER 2: Forrest was
 a Confederate general

-and an early leader of the KKK.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

That is just
objectively terrifying

regardless of context.

He looks like if a nickel
did cocaine.

-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
-So-- so some of these statues

commemorate people who thought
a war to preserve slavery,

were erected to preserve
white supremacy

and were dedicated by
Klan members and yet,

there is a blanket defense

that tends to get
authored by people

and not just people,
also, this guy.

They're trying to take away...
our culture.

They're trying to take away
our history.

Okay, that argument is
taking these statues down

obliterates history, which is
clearly just ridiculous.

First, monuments are not
how we record history,

books are.

Museums are.

Ken Burns
12-part mini-series are.

Statues are how we
glorify people.

Or, in the case of one in Tokyo,
how we glorify

giant radioactive lizards.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And yet,

the President's concern
seems to be

that tearing down statues
leads to a slippery slope.

This week it's Robert E. Lee.

I noticed that

Stonewall Jackson's
coming down,

I wonder, is it
George Washington next week?

And is it Thomas Jefferson
the week after?

You know, you all--

you really do
have to ask yourself,

"Where does it stop?"

Okay, well,
I'll tell you where it stops.

Somewhere.

Anytime someone asks,
"Where does it stop?"

The answer is always,
"Fucking somewhere!"

You might let your kid
have Twizzlers,

but not inject black-tar heroin.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-You d-- you don't just go,

"Well, after the Twizzlers,
where does it stop?"

-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
-And the same is true

of Confederate monuments.

Think of it this way,
all people, living and dead,

exist on what I'm gonna call
The Hitler-Hanks spectrum,

from bad to good.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)
-And at some point

on the spectrum,

monuments to honor people
are going to be inappropriate.

Although it-- to be fair,

it does get tricky
around the middle,

where, of course, you'll fine
Adolf Hankler.

-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
-And-- and look,

there are clearly people
deserving of statues

who were imperfect humans.

And sometimes our standards
change over time,

which can then get tricky,

because you're judging
historical figures

by modern standards.

But for many
Confederate monuments,

especially those erected
well after the Civil War,

valorizing the cause

or leadership
of the Confederacy,

this really isn't a close call.

This is your babysitter
showing up

in a Jimmy Savile t-shirt.

I don't care what you think
that represents,

you're not staying home
with my fucking kid tonight.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And for Robert E. Lee
in particular,

it's actually even easier
because of this.

MALE REPORTER 1: Interestingly,
 Robert E. Lee was once asked

about placing memorials
 at Gettysburg in 1869.

The former general replied,

"I think it wiser... not to
 keep open the sores of war,

but to follow the examples
 of those nations

who endeavored to obliterate
 the marks of civil strife,

to commit to oblivion
 the feelings engendered."

It's true. Robert E. Lee
was opposed to statues

of people like Robert E. Lee.

So, any city that decides
to keep a statue of him

should at the very least
add a speech bubble saying,

"You know, I told you all
specifically, not to do this."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

So-- so what do we do now?

Well-- well, I would argue
that nothing is not acceptable,

and-- and trying
to paper over the cracks

can actually make things worse.

In the 1990s, Richmond tried
to fix its Monument Avenue,

a street lined with statues
of Confederate leaders

by adding
African-American tennis legend,

Arthur Ashe to it.

And you can't just
give Confederates a black friend

and say, "We're good, right?"

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-We're good! Arthur's up there!

You love Arthur!

So-- so, if we really want
to learn from,

and honor our history,
perhaps the first step

might be to put
most of these statues

somewhere more appropriate,

surrounded by
ample historical context,

like in a museum.

Where people go to
proactively learn about history,

and also
to punish their children.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And please,

try not to think of this
as a loss,

because it's actually
a real opportunity,

and I'll show you, please.

Come with me.

-♪ (PATRIOTIC MUSIC PLAYING) ♪
-Because if and when

a pleat becomes empty,

that is a chance for your area
to honor someone

who really deserves it.

A-- And I have some--
some ideas for replacements

that I would love
to run by you.

First, Beaufort County,
South Carolina,

how about
a giant statue of...

Robert Smalls here?

He was born into slavery.

He stole a Confederate boat,
and he sailed it to freedom,

and later served five terms
in Congress.

This guy is amazing.

Atlanta, Texas.

You are the birthplace to...

Bessie Coleman.

The first
African-American woman pilot.

-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-Why would you not want this
in your town? She's incredible!

Now, Florida.

You might not want
an individual,

but how 'bout something
that honors

what your state represents?

Something that says,

"You've got
a little rebel in you."

So, I give you this statue

of your
official state reptile...

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-an alligator

giving everyone the finger.

He's called Herman,

and he definitely says Florida,

while also having
nothing to do with slavery.

And finally,
finally, there is Charleston,

and to you, I say this.

Why have a divisive,
Confederate statue when instead,

that pedestal can be filled
by your favorite son,

-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-the actual Stephen Colbert,

who will stand up there
all day

telling you fun facts
about your wonderful town.

-JOHN OLIVER: Right?
-Yes.

-OLIVER: Really?
-Yes.

Charleston. Charleston.

Charleston is the site
of the first free public library

-in America.
-That's fascinating, Stephen.

Every year,
we host Zugunruhefest,

the Southeast's
most comprehensive

migration-focused
birding festival.

That sounds incredible,
I'll google it!

See Charleston?

You can have this

outside of just whispering the word it's

currently testing season all over the

country and with that comes the usual

flood of anxiety and school produced

even held a test themed pep rally

featuring a monkey mascot look let's all

agree there is no scenario in which the

pointings those those videos and monkey

mascots would have you think that

testing is amazing which is why this

spate of recent news stories has been so

surprising in the lower Hudson Valley

many districts reported that more than

25% of their students opted out more

than 1,700 elementary middle and high

school students opted out of taking the

took the test

yeah like almost the entire auditorium

was filled with kids that didn't take it

not a single junior showed up to take

we got it read lady finger finger devil

baby we've all read the book is a good

story that American students are sick of

tests between benchmarks diagnostic

spree and mock tests they take a lot of

them students are taking between 10 and

20 standardized tests depending on the

grade a total average of 113 different

ones by graduation 113 is a lot of tests

it's approaching the amount that you'd

ask your doctor for the morning after

you woke up from a one-night stand with

Colin Farrell just just give me all of

them twice and this amount of testing

can take a toll teachers have reported

kids throwing up kids crying especially

the younger ones and it's the pressure

that's true in fact this happens so much

that official instructions for test

administrators specify what to do if a

student vomits on his or her test

booklet and something is wrong with our

system when we just assume a certain

number of kids will vomit tests are

supposed to be assessment of skills not

a rap battle on 8 Mile Road

Oh mmm why did your mom make you

spaghetti

she knew tonight was rapid battle nights

so how did we get here what the

explosion of testing can be traced back

to the 90s when you probably remember

stories like these about the state of

public education

when 40 Nations recently took the

International math and science test

American students scored near the bottom

and that must have hurt especially

because you knew the French children

weren't even trying go on play with your

silly numbers they tell you nothing of

the true nature of the solar a week

before you in response to statistics

like that

President George W Bush on just his

third day in office announced his No

Child Left Behind program it passed

Congress with bipartisan support because

of course it did voting against No Child

Left Behind is like voting against no

puppy left unsnag 'old what what monster

would do that

his name is patches and he needs love

the program was designed to be

data-driven and involved testing

children every single year in order to

identify and fix failing schools in the

counter billi system must have a

consequence otherwise it's not much of

an accountability system it's hard to

argue with any of that

unfortunately accountability is one of

those concepts that everybody's in favor

of but nobody knows how to make work

like synergy or maxi dresses no matter

who wears them they look like a poncho

to waterfall you look like the ghost of

Gwyneth Paltrow future I only haunt

Branch goo

No Child Left Behind increase the number

of federally mandated tests from 6 to 17

and the fixation on testing was

something which our current president

seemed to be against as he ran for

office don't tell us that the only way

to teach a child is to spend too much of

a year preparing him to fill out a few

bubbles in a standardized test we know

that's not true

Wow that man knew how to pander to

teachers and yet you know what else they

should be pool tables and the teachers

lounge and every year you should be able

to slap one parents vote for me I'm out

of here

what's this breakthrough took office he

didn't get rid of tests instead he added

his own education initiatives like race

to the top which encourage states to

adopt the common core which featured a

logo of snails sixty-nining and again

the intentions here were good because we

do have underperforming schools and

there are major economic and racial

disparities in the quality of education

children receive and anything that can

help us narrow those gaps is obviously a

good thing the problem has been the

implementation for instance many states

now tie teacher pay to performance using

one particular approach

it's called value-added analysis rating

teachers based on student test scores

for instance if a student who ranked in

the 60th percentile test higher at the

end of the year

the teacher gets a better rating if the

student Falls the teachers rating Falls

okay well that explains why many

teachers class and decorations that used

to read believe in yourself now say

don't come me on this

and what well the idea of trying teacher

pay to student improvement sounds great

in theory here's how it can work in

practice I have four students who's

predicted scores were literally

impossible one of my sixth-grade

students had a predicted score of 286

point three four however the highest a

sixth grade student can earn is 283 the

student did earn a 283 incidentally

despite the fact she earned a perfect

score

she counted negatively towards my

evaluation because she was three points

below her predicted score that is

ridiculous the only way she could have

hit her predicted score was if she

answered everything right roped a few

extra questions of her own got those

right and then stapled them to the test

that teacher lives in Florida which uses

this formula to assess teachers a

formula which looks like the kind of

thing that aliens carve into an

anti-semites cornfield and many of these

formulas on which teachers careers

depend were partly inspired by research

and this is true that modeled the

reproductive trends of livestock

basically we judge the nuance of what

happens in the complicated world of a

child's mind the same way that we judge

this look I don't know what we did wrong

but your child is going to either pass

algebra or birth a healthy calf I don't

know flip a coin with the stakes this

high the tests had better be good but

there is ample reason to suspect that

that is not the case just look at the

Florida Comprehensive Assessment test or

FCAT a Florida school board member was

concerned and a little suspicious when

he learned that only 39% of his state's

tenth graders had performed at or above

grade level in reading so we had an idea

I asked the district at that point to

give me the closest thing they could

legally to the FCAT reading and math

test and I took it that test labeled me

as a poor reader and I have a couple of

master's degrees and I've been reelected

four times and I teach 39 graduate

courses at six universities in this

country okay okay okay

we get it the test sucks anything else

you want to brag about there I also know

how to play mary had a little lamb on

the recorder and guess who could do 16

non-consecutive push-ups King guy look

he does have a point he does have a

point if a test fails to reflect ability

there are human consequences because one

shy Florida eighth grader who had a

near-perfect score in her advanced

language arts class was asked to leave

it last year due to her inexplicably low

scores on the FCAT and last fall she

told a school board meeting exactly how

that felt every year I do good in school

but I get locusts but I get low test

scores on the up cap and it feels like

it's much of the stomach this is unfair

and I don't want to lose my opportunity

to take my classes or get because what

test that is just awful I take back

everything I said about wanting to take

a standardized test in fact you know

what

bring out the monkey with you what is

wrong with you you made that little girl

cry think about what you've done no no

don't you don't you don't sit off you

can't think about what you've done

Oh shame on you

this one you have to ask yourself if

standardized tests are bad for teachers

and bad for kids who exactly are they

good for well it turns out they're

operated by companies like all these and

let's just focus on the largest one

Pearson as of 2012 they had nearly 40%

of the testing market almost triple

their nearest competitor and if you've

never heard of them then congratulations

but just mention their name to any

parent or teacher in a state they

operate in and you see what happens

because Pearson are the educational

equivalent of Time Warner Cable either

you've never had an interaction with

them and don't care or they have ruined

your life

Pearson have a shocking amount of

influence over America's schools so much

so that at this point a hypothetical

girl could take Pearson tests from

kindergarten through at least eighth

grade but a test by the way that she

studied for using Pierce and curriculum

and textbooks taught to her by teachers

who were certified by their own Pearson

test if at some point she was tested for

a learning disability like ADHD that's

also a Pearson test and if she

eventually got sick of Pearson and

dropped out well she'd have to take the

GED which is now guess what also a

Pearson test in fact the only test they

have no hand in is the HPV test you

might take in college I can only assume

that they'll get on that as soon as they

see this show Pearson has

enjoyed spectacular growth and profits

and yet their track record is littered

with complaints concerning technical

glitches slow grading and even the

contents of their tests take take what

happened in New York just a few years

ago almost 30 different test questions

have now been declared invalid because

they're confusing or have outright

errors they'd already pulled six

questions from an English exam related

to a bizarre passage about a talking

pineapple talking pineapple well at the

risk of sounding like a DreamWorks

executive talking to a CGI animator tell

me more about this talking pineapple

students had to answer questions about

the story which they say goes like this

a pineapple challenges a hair to erase

other animals figure the fruit has a

trick up its sleeve but the hair wins

and the animals eat the pineapple it

ends with the moral pineapples don't

have sleeves I was really confused

because I expected a lot more from them

that article about the pineapple in the

hair was stupid and absurd yeah she's

not wrong about that because we looked

up that test section and we couldn't

work out all the answers that pineapple

item doesn't remotely work as a test

question it barely works as a doors

lyric but it's it's not just Pearson's

questions that are a problem it's how

they check the answers the company

posted this ad to Craigslist it's to

find people to grade the exams

Craigslist they look for scorers on

Craigslist

Pearson chooses tests graders the same

way that you'd look for a mattress full

of bedbugs or a no-strings-attached hand

job and to be clear here just to be

clear this is not just a Pearson problem

across the whole testing industry you

can find former graders who will tell

you horror stories we looked at an essay

every two minutes a short answer every

five seconds every ten seconds we don't

understand your kids we don't understand

anyone's kids that is not an acceptable

answer from a person who may be

responsible for the future of your child

it's barely acceptable from the

manufacturers of American Girl dolls we

make dolls for a hundred bucks that kids

can't play with in case they get them

dirty we don't understand your kids we

don't understand anyone's kids as

another score points out sometimes great

are given out not based on merit but on

quota I was told when I was beginning a

project that last year you know there

were a certain amount of to a certain

amount of three is a certain amount of

force we expect that to be similar this

year if that's not similar they will

tell you we're scoring too many threes

we're scoring too many fours they'll say

you have to learn to see more papers as

a three you have to learn to see more

papers as a four that makes no sense if

the content of what you're looking at

has not changed that's not telling a

baseball umpire hey we've got a problem

with

averages you need to see more home runs

and strikeouts and more strikeouts as

doubles do it now

and I would love to show you more

questions from these tests but

unfortunately that's not only difficult

it's often illegal because both states

and companies have fought to keep test

questions secret for having teachers and

students signed statements like I will

not use or discuss the content of secure

test materials and while they'll say

that this is to protect against cheating

it does seem odd that even if you see

something wrong on a test you can't tell

anyone

standardized tests basically enforce the

rule that all subway riders

instinctively obey if you see something

keep it the to yourself we've all

seen someone vomit in a purse before

leave it

focus ahead and leave it bury it look

look we've had more than a decade of

standardized testing now and maybe it's

time to put the test to the test

the original goal was to narrow the

achievement gap and boost our scores

relative to the rest of the world

well a 2013 study found no support for

the idea that no child left behind an

hour at the achievement gap and our

scores on the international tests have

not only failed to rise they're slightly

down and I do not want to hear what that

French kid thinks of those results cause

this time and all this money and your

highs to the top has been how you say a

meandering jog on a treadmill

for a middle of what both presidents

asked for when selling their reforms

higher standards are the right goal

accountability is the right goal an

accountability system must have a

consequence otherwise it's not much of

an accountability system right so let's

look at that because as far as I can see

this is a system which has enriched

multiple companies and that pays and

fires teachers with a cattle birthing

formula confuses children with talking

pineapples and as the same kind of rules

regarding transparency that Brad Pitt

had for Fight Club so so for Pearson the

other companies and all the lawmakers

who have supported this system the true

test is going to be either convincing

everyone it works or accepting it

doesn't work and fixing it because at

the risk of sounding like a standardized

test score your numbers are not good and

if it seems unfair to have your fate

riding on a complicated metric that

fails to take institutional factors into

account and might not even tell the

whole story well you're not wrong about

that but you do not get to complain

about it and if all this pressure to

increase your numbers is making you feel

nauseous like you might vomit at any

second

and don't worry I've got four words for

you that'll make you feel better

here comes

sex education the conversation animals

in zoos refuse to let you not have now

with some kids going back to school next

week it is guaranteed that at some point

over the next school year you'll hear

stories like this local parents are

outraged tonight over the pictures that

their children saw in sex ed class some

parents say that the material which

includes descriptions of sex acts and

infections is simply too graphic for

middle schoolers a father is upset after

his 13 year old showed him a poster

hanging on a classroom door a poster

listing sex acts parental anger over sex

ed is as much a staple of the school

year as Square pizza

and one kid coming back from summer

vacation with a mustache he's way too

proud of that that's a ghost mustache

Luis it looks like the real mustache

died on your face so so we tried this

week to find out what sex ed looks like

in America right now but that turns out

to be a surprisingly difficult question

to answer now in the past depending on

how old you are sex education may have

been little more than watching films

like this every so often I get a strong

sex urge and the only way I can take

care of it is to masturbate Jorge I'm

really pleased that you can tell me

about this perhaps it's because we've

known each other for so long my name is

John extent for me it all started when I

went bowling with Judy today I shoulda

known something was different as soon as

she got a strike she's usually such a

rotten bowler so what's so different

about I got my first period today

it means that blood is flowing out of my

uterus okay okay okay first that is some

incredible misinformation menstrual

blood is not some sort of uterine HGH

that makes you amazing at bowling and

second and this is true the young man in

that video is Jonathan banks Mike from

Breaking Bad does not provide the basis

for the prequel to better core soul I'm

going to be extremely disappointed

teaching sex addict in schools is really

important for obvious reasons no parent

wants to talk to their kids about sex

and no kid wants to talk about sex with

their parents that is why when you're

watching a movie together and there's a

sex scene everyone becomes motionless

and silently begs for the merciful

release of death and kids have good

questions that need good answers The

Times recently ran an article with a

slideshow of questions kids wrote on on

cards to a sex educator including why is

the boy's penis shaped like an arrow is

it okay to be gay and how long do I have

to wait to have sex I'm excited to it to

which the answers are its engorged with

blood yes and can you at least wait

until the end of class but perhaps the

most poignant question was will this go

well for me because after looking into

sex ed programs this week the answer

depends quite a bit on where you live

there is no required standard for sex ed

in this country in fact only 22 states

mandate to the kids receive it and only

13 require that the information

presented be medically accurate which is

crazy you wouldn't accept a history

class not being historically accurate

Prince started the American Revolution

in 1994 and his Purple Reign lasts until

the present day class dismissed

what we essentially have a weird

patchwork system that varies wildly and

not just from state to state but from

district to district and even from

school to school in fact one oh hi oh

newscast

try to find out what kids in their area

were learning and hit a brick wall the

state has no absolutely none sex ed

guidelines so each school district

decides what's best for whatever kid

many school districts don't want to talk

about it at all you see students pulled

every school district in for Southwest

Ohio counties the majority wouldn't tell

us what they teach and when they teach

it even though all this is supposed to

be public information and that's really

not good because two teenagers shouldn't

have completely different levels of sex

ed just because they're in two different

school districts at tonight's football

game if it's when Lakewood High and

Middletown high not only are they bitter

rivals one of those teams has no idea

what a diaphragm is let's play ball

let's play ball but but while it is hard

to find out what kids are learning in

some cases it is possible to find out

what they are not learning for instance

in Mississippi while you can talk about

contraceptives the law prohibits condom

demonstrations in class that means no

condom on a banana no condom on a

cucumber no condom on a zucchini and

that's terrible partly because it's fun

putting condoms on produce but mainly

because Mississippi ranked number two in

the country in teen pregnancy rates now

thankfully this situation has inspired

some creative alternatives what this

former teacher described how to use a

condom without directly using a condom

because I want to make sure that there's

room for my toes when I'm engaging in

Shu activity take your stock and you

want to roll it all the way down it's

not perfect no if you can't get a sock

out of the packaging you don't then lose

your foot for a minutes and need to

think of Rihanna to get it back but its

back but but Mississippi's restrictions

are just the beginning here in eight

states there are laws considerably

limiting what teachers can say about

homosexuality to their students

meaning the answer to that kid's

question is it okay to be gay could be a

shrug or a lot worse and Utah's law

prohibits any instruction in the

intricacies of intercourse for reasons

that one state legislator explained

those are the things we do not want to

be taught in our schools those are

things that should be taught in your

home what taught in your home here is an

exchange that has never happened how are

you so good at sex I was home-schooled

and it's in certain districts around the

country the only sex ed you might

receive is abstinence only which you may

think of as a relic of the past but it

is still very much around Congress

recently increased federal funding for

abstinence only education from the from

about fifty to seventy-five million

dollars per year and at least part of

that money gets matched by the states

which means that students are still

being exposed to abstinence centered

programs but we've names like wait which

stands for why am i tempted go ape or

abstinence protects everyone and no

screwing around which I presume stands

for no one should copy like regularly

except when did individuals and now

reach around occasionally ultimately not

disastrous

and here's here's a taste of a video

from that last program if you have sex

outside of one permanent monogamous and

monogamy does not mean one at a time

that means one partner who has only been

with you you have sex outside of that

context and you will pay boys if there's

a girl throwing herself at you if she's

the one pressuring you for sex if this

is a girl that's dressing in that manner

that's saying not only of you but the

rest of the world take me now I got a

little word of advice for you run from

the screw run I did not say what go away

slowly

I said run from her in fact uh don't

even bother running boys just cut your

dicks off girls are snake charmers and

it's time to murder your snakes murder

them now do it do it

and what abstinence is a healthy choice

that many teams will make either by

choice or as I can attest by

circumstance

only thing you teach and not just

because many studies question its

efficacy the fact is according to the

CDC most Americans have more than one

sexual partner in their lifetime and the

average age at which people begin having

sex is around 17 so just saying don't do

it is not practical and even when they

do teach sex ed schools can teach it

with a strong bias we found a company

which offers schools two versions of the

same video on contraception version B is

labeled as being non-judgmental take a

look look no one ever said being a

teenager is easy you have to face a lot

of important decisions but no decision

is probably more important than the one

you'll make about becoming sexually

active some of you may already be

sexually active but still a lot of you

are not having sex yet you could be

waiting for marriage the right person or

maybe you're just not ready to take on

this very serious responsibility right

now cool oops

thumbs up those 30 year old actors

dressed like teenager from the 90s make

some very good points however however

version a which is non non-judgmental

goes in a slightly different direction

see if you can spot it look no one ever

said being a teenager is easy you have

to face a lot of important decisions but

no decision is probably more important

than the one you'll make about becoming

sexually active as a teenager you're

expected to wait until you're married

before you become sexually active until

then

abstinence is the only option that's

acceptable to your family your school

and your community well hold on then why

do they even keep the first part about

it being a decision at all they should

have just said no decision is more

non-existent than the one you don't get

to make about sex

also remember God is watching you

masturbate and the fluids coming out of

your genitals are actually his tears you

may

who's sad but they're very fact two

videos with the same title but very

different messages exist shows just how

hard it can be to find out what's going

on with sex ed where you live and this

is not even accounting for guest

speakers that schools can bring in to

augment their program remember the woman

from no screwing around that's Pam

stencil and her website claims she

speaks to half a million young people

each year presumably like this here's

the line over which you can't step

absolutely no genital contact of any

kind

that's hand to genital mouth to genital

genital to genital oral sex which is

mouth to genital is sex and if you have

ever stepped over this line you've

risked disease and you need to get

tested and don't you dare don't you dare

tell anyone you're a virgin why why are

you trying to yell the horniness out of

teenagers throw programs like hers are

so relentlessly anti sex you could

easily come away thinking the adult

world is just an endless barrage of

unwanted dicks which incidentally was

the original slogan for tinder

stanzin is not alone Shelley Donohue

currently speaks at schools around the

country she likes to show the dangers of

more than one sexual partner by

describing women as a piece of tape and

then sticking the tape to the arms of

multiple boys until this happens how

many partners do we have before we get

married on average in America yeah so

can you imagine what's gonna start to

happen to the tape it's gonna lose its

bonding power her point is the tape is

used so much it becomes damaged which

doesn't even consider the possibility

that the tape might be perfectly happy

and have had a good time or that maybe

some guys like take that already knows

how to stick when they meet them but but

this idea that sex is something which

devalues those who've had it

particularly women crops up again and

again non virgins can be likened to a

used toothbrush or a chewed up piece of

gum and then there is this video in

which a non virgin on her wedding night

is compared to a dirty shoe my sneakers

business it looks like the entire

football team has been in these things I

made them all wear socks socks but shell

socks don't protect my heart you can

still get foot fungus with sauce I wish

I could go back in time and make a

commitment to be abstinent until

marriage that is heartbreaking and not

just because he's shaming his wife but

because Michelle socks don't protect my

heart might be the funniest line ever

delivered on this show and we didn't

write it

and that that kind of message can be

hugely damaging to anyone who hears it

especially survivors of sexual assault

like Elizabeth Smart who was kidnapped

and assaulted at the age of 14 and you

may recognize one of the metaphors she

remembers one of her teachers using she

said imagine you're a stick of gum and

when you engage in sex that's like

that's like getting chew and then if you

do that lots of times it's gonna become

an old piece of gum and who's going to

want to rock through that

well that terrible but nobody should

ever say that but for me I thought oh my

gosh I'm not chewed up piece of gum

learning nothing would have been better

than learning that it's not a great

reflection on her teacher that kids who

were sick that day got a better

education than she did and the sad thing

is sex ed when done well can do so much

good but when it's done badly it can do

real harm take consent a recent survey

found college students were confused

about certain aspects of it for instance

when asked whether another person

undressing getting a condom or nodding

established consent for more sexual

activity at least 40 percent said yes

and at least 40 percent said no and that

ambiguity is a problem because sex is

like boxing if both people didn't fully

agree to participate one of them is

committing a crime and abstinence heavy

messages do not help this they spend so

much time on the importance of saying no

they can leave out what informed

enthusiastic consent looks like or even

worse suggests that it's all one party's

responsibility like in this video from a

program called sex smart about fending

off unwanted advances maybe we should

have sex you know to prove our love for

each other do you really think we're

ready yeah oops that didn't work each

other

no does that mean no yes

one more try this time say it like you

mean it

each other no way finally maybe we

should just get to the concert wait what

they were already late for a concert but

he felt there was still time to have sex

that is a teenage boy with a very

accurate sense of his abilities but much

much much more to the point it's good

that that girl was being taught that she

has the power to say no but nowhere in

the video do they point out that that

guy should have been a lot better at

hearing it and it is weird to gloss over

something so appalling it's like that

moment in Greece when Kenickie sang tell

me more tell me more did she put up a

fight that's the point they should have

stopped the whole song and gone wait

what what the did you just say what is

wrong with you Kenickie what is what

you're a monster and you look 40 and

when kids graduate high school without a

full understanding of consent

you are abetting an already troubling

culture where a bunch of frat guys can

march around Yale feeling completely

comfortable yelling out this just a

quick reminder there Yale's acceptance

rate is six point three percent so who

the are they turning down I would

hate to hear their chants and the

problem is that is not an isolated

incident last year fraternities at both

Texas Tech and LSU will caught using the

same slogan it's become something you

hear on college campuses as often as I'm

thinking of switching majors or why is

James Franco here

here is the thing there is no way we'd

allow any other academic program to

consistently fail to prepare students

for life after school and human

sexuality

unlike calculus is something you

actually need to know about for the rest

of your life

and maybe you and your family live

somewhere that has good sex ed in which

case congratulations but if you don't

this video is for you look no one ever

said being a teenager is D did you have

to face a lot of important decisions but

no decision is probably more important

than the one you'll make about becoming

sexually active and if you do there's a

few things you should definitely know

this is a penis this is a vagina this is

a head and this is a but you can mix as

many of these as you feel comfortable in

hand and mouth would be you could this

is the clitoris and these are the

testicles they make sperm that's pretty

much it if you want to be abstinent

that's fine if you don't want to be

absent

that's also fine abstinence is like

being a vegetarian people should respect

your choice

some people might make fun of you those

people are assholes safeguard against

STDs is protection unless you already

have an STD in which case you're gonna

need medicine or some fun fact the

ancient Egyptians put crocodile dung

mixed with honey inside a vagina to

prevent pregnancy they're all dead now

here's how you put a condom on a banana

oh this is a lot less curvy than I'm

used to

this is an IUD an IUD goes inside a

woman's body and prevents pregnancy from

taking place

they can stay inside you for up to ten

years which is a lot considering most

guys in high school can only stay inside

you for a minute or two to up here's a

bunch of other forms of birth control

this is actually simple if someone

doesn't want to have sex with you don't

have sex with them

if you think you might be able to

persuade someone to have sex even though

they don't want to don't so if you're

not sure if someone wants to have sex

with you ask even if you're kind of sure

if someone is pretty drunk they might

not be able to give consent and remember

you can always say no even if someone

wants you to do a sex thing you're not

comfortable with you have the right to

refuse say I don't care if it's a birth

defect I don't want you to put your

finger in my butt okay real quick couple

funny things most people will get HPV is

both technically true and what you tend

to hear right before someone gives you

HPV if you call it a hoo-ha you are not

ready for sex food is your friend

believe me if you get a chance to have

sex with this man

go for it this safe word is Putin Annie

a woman who's had sex is not like a

dirty shoe a woman who's had sex is like

a a shoe with laces completely normal

and finally in this isn't for you anyone

ever tells you that getting your period

makes you better at both

[Applause]

criminal justice the process by which

you are arrested charged and eventually

go before a jury who render their

verdict we find the defendant Robert

Brooks not guilty we find Randall Bailey

guilty we find the defendant not guilty

have you reached the wording guilty or

not guilty

that is just objectively charming

although all these years later I still

can't believe those penguins wrongfully

convicted the Central Park five now

whenever whenever we talk whenever we

talk about criminal justice reform we

tend to just talk about policing public

defenders judges and prisons and skip

over a crucial element there prosecutors

the attorneys who work for the federal

state and local government and bring

cases to trial there are roughly 2,500

DA's offices all around the country and

they have a surprising amount of

influence at almost every single stage

of the criminal justice system because

prosecutors decide whether you get

charged and what you get charged with

and therefore heavily influenced what

kind of sentence you could face and you

you sort of know deep down how important

they are because of a little phrase that

crops up constantly

in local news crime stories ultimately

it'll be prosecutors who decide whether

charges will be filed prosecutors will

decide whether to file criminal charges

prosecutors will decide what happens

next prosecutors will decide exactly

prosecutors will decide it's one of

those three word phrases that you hear

so often you don't even think about what

it means anymore like User Agreement

update or some restrictions apply or

Tyler Perry presents you know at this

point I'm just going to assume that he

presents everything it's safer that way

I technically think he presents this

show I wouldn't be completely surprised

about that

I look we tend not to think about that

power very much except when there is a

high-profile controversy concerning

prosecutors failure to exercise it as

has happened in numerous police

shootings of unarmed black men or when

Manhattan da saw Vance declined to

prosecute Harvey Weinstein in 2015

citing insufficient evidence despite

police officials insisting that they had

plenty of evidence including Exhibit A

his face but but it but it is worth

talking about what happens when

prosecutors do decide to exercise that

power because while many try to do their

jobs honorably that power can be misused

or amplified the inequities inherent in

the system and let's start with a truly

incredible fact here the vast majority

of the time your fate is not decided by

a judge or a jury of your peers because

nearly 95 percent of the cases

prosecutors decide to bring end up with

the defendant pleading guilty now what

that means is no trial no innocent until

proven guilty just a prosecutor striking

a deal behind closed doors and many

judges are resigned to that fact because

at least plea bargains keep the system

moving the system would collapse if

every case that was filed in the

criminal justice system were to be set

for trial the system would just entirely

collapse exactly it's an inadequate

system that only functions if people

constantly give up it's built on the

exact same model as AT&T x' customer

service hotline that's right AT&T new

owners of HBO longtime owners of an

unforgivably dog customer service

hotline

if somebody pleads guilty they they must

have done it that's not necessarily the

case in Houston testing of samples in

drug cases have exonerated 133 people

since 2014 and those people had pled

guilty in every single case which is

messed up the only people who should be

claiming to have used drugs when they

happen to awkward teenagers at high

school parties oh I'm totally a wieder

I'm into all the weeds I'm stoning right

now that's how potted I am so so why do

innocent people plead guilty what

prosecutors will often offer a deal

while threatening that if you go to

trial they will stack charges against

you and pursue a much harsher sentence

it's something commonly referred to as a

trial penalty just listen to Rodney

Roberts he was accused of a sexual

assault the DNA evidence later proved he

did not commit and I'll let him explain

what he took a deal when I finally got

to the court this attorney he came in

and told me that the prosecutor office

had a plea agreement from it and like

plea agreement even do it you know I

pled not guilty I'm innocent

he was like this urgent he was this

pressure and he was like if you don't

take this deal the only offer your two

years you're home in two years and if

not you know they're gonna take it off

to trial and a judge is ready to give

you a life sentence if you get found

guilty and I think you're gonna get

found guilty and this is my attorney

telling me it's the one person I had to

dead out me so I thought that to get

home to my son

they're my family and established in my

life that the best thing I could do for

myself was to plead guilty and fight it

once I got home and as crazy as it

sounds to hear that it kind of makes

sense two years in prison is terrible

but a life sentence is absolutely

terrifying the only way that makes sense

were defendant to risk that is if

they're a gerbil because two years in

life are basically the same thing to

those litters

but but but let's say you are one of the

five percent of people who risk going to

trial prosecutors still have lots of

ways to try and gain an advantage for

instance prosecutors are not allowed to

discriminate by race during jury

selection and if it's suspected that

they are the Supreme Court has said that

they could be required to provide race

neutral explanations for striking tours

which sounds like a good rule but it has

been laughably easy for them to get

around because judges will accept just

about any reason in Texas a training

document for prosecutors even

conveniently listed examples of

race-neutral reasons that judges had

accepted including having a 1970s hairdo

being a very pretty girl who might be

attracted to the defendant or the

defense counsel wearing a Malcolm X hat

agreeing with the OJ Simpson verdict

being a male wearing earrings in both

ears and my personal favorites for

wearing a bad boys club jacket pink hat

and snakeskin belts which is just

insulting because that look does not

make you untrustworthy it makes you

awesome I like the way I look at

guarantee perhaps the area where

prosecutors can exert the most influence

concerns evidence because they control

the case files things like police

reports witness information and physical

evidence and while they are required to

hand over anything that is exculpatory

or that might be useful in your defense

in some states including New York they

can do that at the very last minute

something incredible happens on the day

of trial certainly a case file that for

a year was this thick suddenly now

becomes this thick and so in our most

serious cases in the cases where we have

climbed to are looking at incredible

amounts of potential jail time even life

in jail this is what we are given when

DA's answer ready for trial and the

reality is is that in Manhattan too

often it is trial by ambush it's true

and they can then have to argue a case

without having read all the important

material it's basically a much higher

stakes version of a kid giving a

presentation in English class without

having read the book in conclusion

whether Heights the heights are watering

but by the end the heights rather much

more than they weathered at the

beginning of the book thank you for your

time just a quick but important message

for English teachers no one has ever

read a single book you have ever

assigned it has never happened not once

and look sometimes defense attorneys may

not be given exculpatory evidence at all

in fact among exoneration cases around

1/4 of them involve prosecutors

concealing its culprit ory evidence and

that is because prosecutors typically

get to decide whether something is

relevant to the defense which seems

inherently flawed

you can't just count on an adversary to

voluntarily expose all of their

weaknesses in Star Wars the rebels had

to steal the Death Star plans the Empire

didn't just email it to them with a

subject line for word gigantic stupid

weak spot parentheses very dumb go to

town and when prosecutors do withhold

evidence there is very little

accountability for them take Michael

Morton like in 1987 he was wrongfully

convicted of his wife's murder after the

prosecutor in that case withheld crucial

pieces of exculpatory evidence now the

good news is that prosecutor Ken

Anderson was held to account for that

misconduct the bad news is there was a

slight discrepancy between the two men's

sentences Morton served nearly 25 years

in prison

8900 95 days and now the sentence for

the prosecutor just 10 days in jail for

contempt of court 10 days and he served

less than half that although before you

get too mad he did also have to pay a

$500 fine which which isn't really the

penalty you'd expect for wiping out 25

years of someone's life it's close to

what you'd expect for a

cantaloupe at Whole Foods 10 days for

the public indecency $500 for the

cantaloupe

and to make it to make it even worse

Anderson is actually the only prosecutor

to ever serve any time for misconduct

resulting in a wrongful conviction ever

because the truth is prosecutors rarely

face any sort of consequences for

misconduct state bars are supposed to

hold them accountable but a study of

five states found that in 660 cases

where courts had confirmed prosecutorial

misconduct the number of prosecutors

disciplined in those cases was one and

that lack of accountability can fuel a

dangerous culture where winds are

already prioritized to a disturbing

degree in fact in one DA's office in

Colorado

prosecutors were paid bonuses for

achieving a high conviction rate and in

Texas a DA rewarded convictions in

misdemeanor cases with a prize that they

called the trial dog award and let me

just say as the proud proud owner of

nine trial dogs my award goes to this

one please don't die please please don't

die I can't how important it is for you

to hang in there and and and there was

there was the notoriously aggressive

office also of New Orleans DA Harry

Connick senior who is yes Harry Connick

Jr's dad in fact here they are on Harry

jr. short-lived talk show singing a

weirdly inappropriate Joette just well

the

[Music]

[Applause]

Harry's wild about me the heavenly

places of his kisses

yeah now if you didn't see any problem

with that he's just a fun experiment for

you to try at home call your own father

right now

tell him that the heavenly bliss is of

his kisses fill you with ecstasy and

just see how that goes my prediction is

your next fishing trip is going to be

extra quiet but during his time as New

Orleans da lots of people were wild

about Harry Connick senior because his

office was famously ruthless Harry

Connick was tough on crime he was very

aggressive and he wanted to block him

all up forever conics lead prosecutor

was Jim Williams Jim took great pride in

his numerous death penalty convictions

he even kept a miniature electric chair

on his desk Jim was regarded as one of

the most aggressive prosecutors in the

District Attorney's Office he described

sliding up behind defendants in the

courtroom and buzzing in their ears to

mimic the the buzz of electricity holy

that is just not okay although

there was also literally no scenario in

which sliding up behind someone in

saying buzz in their ear is acceptable

not even if you are Neil Armstrong on

the moon and you need to get Buzz

Aldrin's attention hey buzz buzz buzz

buzz we're on the moon buzz buzz buzz

buzz are you mad I was first buzz buzz

but but that office is win at all costs

culture resulted in some serious

mistakes as it turns out fully a quarter

of the men sentenced to death during

conics tenure had their convictions

overturned because of improperly

withheld evidence and remember that

little electric chair when the

prosecutors had on his desk here's a fun

fact in the photo of Jim Williams with

the electric chair of the five faces

visible all of them were released from

death row yep

the thing he kept as a token of his

success is now a monument to poor

decision-making it is the prosecutorial

equivalent of Cuba Gooding jr. zaask er

and look if you want to see why did that

joke upset you more than anything else

tonight you have got to be consistent

you've got to be you might care about

Cuba you care about him too much in this

context and look if you want to see all

the problems that I've described tonight

in action just take a look at the case

of Glen Ford who was on death row for 30

years after being wrongfully convicted

now the prosecutor on his case Marty

Stroud says that he got caught up in an

aggressive hard-charging culture and

admits to among other things

deliberately excluding African American

jurors and overlooking evidence that

would have cleared Glen Ford and what

happened clearly still haunts him I

ended up without anybody else's help

putting a man on death row who didn't

belong there I mean at the end of the

day beginning in middle whatever you

want to call it I did something that was

very very bad yeah it was it was very

very very bad in fact the problem is

that while he is clearly remorseful in

terms of accountability there were no

professional sanctions for his actions

in fact the acting da after Ford was

released Dale Cox doesn't even believe

that Stroud should have apologized did

mr. Ford get justice in this case I

think he has

gotten delayed justice the system did

not fail mr. Ford it did not it did not

in fact the system you see that because

he's not on death row and that's how I

can say it getting out of prison after

30 years is justice well it's better

than dying there and it's better than

being executed yeah I guess that's true

but listen to how low he's setting the

bar they're better than being executed

or dying in prison by that measure

anything succeeds Taco Bell

better than being executed or dying in

prison although when you think about it

is it is it definitely between 2010 and

2014 that man's office was responsible

for sending more prisoners to death row

than anywhere else in the country and if

you think the Glen Ford debacle may have

made him more cautious you would be

wrong I think society should be

employing the death penalty more rather

than less but there have been ten other

inmates on death row in Louisiana who

have been exonerated clearly the system

is not flawless

are you sure that you've gotten a right

all the time I'm reasonably confident

that that I've gotten it right

oh you're reasonably confident are you

that does not seem like it should be the

standard to send someone to death row I

was reasonably confident I could pull

off bangs I was wrong about that

and if someone's life depended on it I

might have given it a little more

thought and look at this point you may

well be wondering how can we fix some of

what we've seen tonight well clearly

permanent legislative fixes are badly

needed from requiring greater

transparency from prosecutors about

sharing evidence through so-called

open file laws to ideally establishing

independent commissions to investigate

misconduct but depending on where you

live there may actually be a more direct

way for you to effect change because

DA's are usually elected it's something

you might sometimes forget until you see

aggressive campaign attack ads like this

one which ends in a bizarre turn of

phrase this is how many child molesters

the Calcasieu Parish do

he has prosecuted as lead counsel

how many murders how many rapes Roberts

meanwhile our sheriff reports crime is

on the rise and Calcasieu Parish Steve

Street for District Attorney

he'll try harder and a lot more but he

would try a harder and a lot more often

that's a pretty weak promise Steve the

was your opponent's Logan Nathan

Hamilton justice on Mondays and

Wednesdays unless something comes up

well it seems like it's gonna be a whole

thing look the facts prosecutors are

elected means that you can change them

the problem is around 85% of prosecutors

actually run unopposed in both primary

and general elections it's gotten so bad

that in one County in Washington state

their prosecutor had run for ten terms

without any opposition so four years ago

in frustration someone ran ran their dog

against him I know I know what you're

thinking I'll great another white dog

prosecutor and I'm not saying you're

wrong but let's go one step at a time

here look clearly we need more

reform-minded DA's to run because thanks

to the extreme breadth of power they

have that could actually be a backdoor

way to effect change on a whole host of

issues from fail to the misuse of

forensic science to the enforcement of

marijuana laws and maybe you are one of

the lucky ones here maybe your local DA

is great

or maybe they're a win obsessed asshole

whose heavenly Bliss's of their kisses

fill their adults songs with ecstasy or

maybe a live in Washington State over

the past four years your district

attorney has been this dog and

you didn't even realize it because can

you honestly say with a hundred percent

certainty that your district attorney is

not a dog you probably can't and that's

kind of the problem here most people

know as much about their local DA as

they know about their local Cheesecake

Factory manager chances are you don't

know who they are and if you do it's

probably because something truly

terrible has happened

but the truth is like the Cheesecake

Factory

prosecutors have the ability to ruin

lives in a second so so we need to find

out who our DA's are and get a sense of

the policies and priorities that they're

carrying out where we live because if we

do not decide ourselves what we want the

criminal justice system to look like

deep down you know who will exactly they

will

vaccines or as the fun doctor and your

family practice books it shot-shot

shot-shot shot-shot shot-shot church

seriously there'll be a slight pinch

now vaccines are one of humanity's most

incredible accomplishments and they've

saved millions of lives and there was a

time when a new one was a cause for huge

celebration dr. Jonas Salk discovers a

vaccine that promises to wipe out

childhoods crippling and killing enemy

polio anxious parents are thrilled and

grateful responding to one of the

greatest mass inoculations and medical

annals it's true people lined up for the

polio shot like it was an iPhone

although although for the record polio

was never childhoods most crippling

enemy because that was and will forever

remain accidentally seeing your father's

penis

but suffice it by their success small

groups are both skeptical and vocal

about vaccines which is nothing new but

these days their voice has been

amplified by the human megaphone that is

the President of the United States I am

totally in favor of vaccines but I want

smaller doses over a longer period of

time because you take a baby in and I've

seen it and I've seen it and I had my

children taking care of over a long

period of time over two or three year

period of time same exact amount but you

take this little beautiful baby and you

pump I mean it looks just like it's

meant for a horse not for a child that

is totaled from on the campaign trail

raising doubts about vaccinations and

that is a sentiment that he's also

expressed online with a tweet reading

tiny children are not horses and that

that is an assertion that PolitiFact

rates yeah I mean I guess technically

we've got to give him that but you agree

and look look you know this you know

this it is not wise to take health care

advice from man who has willingly sought

care from this doctor who looks like he

sneaks into a sin you're frogs in the

middle of the night to Fox the boxer

elastics you let you know that but but

it is not just Trump who is skeptical

and those concerns have driven some

people to extremes for instance back in

2011 some parents made headlines by

taking what they saw are they more

natural route to immunizing their

children Catherine were talking about

parents who are taking use the lollipops

saliva and puss soaked clothing from

complete strangers and deliberately

infecting their children okay okay all

right so setting aside the grossest of

parents infecting their kids with

lollipops from strangers that graphic

has an unfortunate misspelling because

swapping spit and passing pulse

sounds like the TED talk that Kid Rock

would give you a teenage shot

what's wrong I know you're going to want

to swap some straight past the hood but

if you don't throw a raincoat on that

devil dog it's going to be stored silly

for you buckaroo this was quality time

we just had some quality time and while

it is important to remember that the

vast majority of parents are making sure

that their children get vaccinated on

time the voices of those who don't carry

any internet search about vaccines will

quickly lead you down a frightening

rabbit hole and the background hum of

doubt can make some parents

understandably nervous I'm concerned

about how many vaccines you need

remember we have to give our children at

once some kind of debating whether I

will do them but I'm debating the age

when should I have them done there's

just so much information there I don't I

don't know who to ask I don't know if

there's you know there's no such thing

as an unbiased source at least 10

percent of parents delay or skip some

shots around 1 percent don't vaccinate

at all right you know parents get so

much information it is hard to know what

to do should you vaccinate should you

eat the placenta should you let kids cry

and the answer to those by the way are

yes no and absolutely because the more

they try now the more they'll be

prepared to watch this is us when they

get older

[Applause]

and this this atmosphere of confusion

about vaccines has caused real problems

there are now 11 states where the number

of unvaccinated kids is on the rise and

in small pockets all over America the

numbers can get startlingly high in the

Somali community in Minnesota the

measles vaccination rate for children

dropped to just 42 percent and that had

some very real consequences measles once

eradicated in the u.s. is now exploding

in Minnesota Somali community where many

parents won't vaccinate the virus is so

contagious that if you're exposed to it

and you don't have the vaccine there's a

90% chance you'll contract it they can

have permanent brain damage they can

have blindness or deafness and so we

wouldn't vaccinate if this was just a

Raschi illness this is a very serious

disease exactly and this is how bad it

is in that community the number of

measles cases so far this year has

already outpaced the total number in all

the US last year and that is terrible

because the only thing Minnesota should

have more of than any other state is

Garrison Keillor and people disappointed

by the Mall of America

oh so it's just a bigger mall and it has

to build-a-bear workshops that's amazing

this memory will last me a lifetime

as will these two bears for two

different build-a-bear workshop so

tonight we are going to look at why

these beers persist and what the

consequences of succumbing to them can

be and before we start I kind of get why

vaccines can creep people out

vaccinations can mean getting injected

by a needle filled with science juice

although pretty much every medical

practice sounds terrifying when you

break it down like that an appendectomy

means removing one of your organs

through stabber II antibiotics are

poisons used to murder things living in

you and even exercise means forcefully

burning up your inside

my point is the human body is a true

Carnival of Horrors and frankly I'm

embarrassed to have one

and what much of the fear surrounding

vaccines stems from their supposedly to

autism now that is a theory that gained

traction in the late 90s thanks to a

study published in the medical journal

The Lancet suggesting a link between

autism and the MMR vaccine the study was

of just 12 children and it was by this

guy Andrew Wakefield and if you're

wondering why I didn't say dr. Andrew

Wakefield this is why follow-up studies

of hundreds of thousands of children

could not find any evidence that the MMR

vaccine causes autism and investigations

into Wakefield's original paper revealed

he distorted the data and acted

unethically

he's lost his medical license The Lancet

paper has been retracted

it's true Wakefield's made a big splash

before having his legacy tarnished and

his title revoked he's basically the

Lance Armstrong of doctors but but but

even though Wakefield conclusions have

been debunked many times he not only

denies wrongdoing he actually still

gives talks about the supposed dangers

of the MMR vaccine in fact this is him

in 2011 talking to the Somali community

that we saw earlier in Minnesota and

presumably ending his speech with trust

me I'm a used to be a doctor and to be

fair Wakefield is not the only voice

raising alarms about vaccines he has

company from across the political

spectrum from a Robert F Kennedy jr. on

the left to Alex Jones wherever the

he fits in to even this guy he can't

make you can't make people do procedure

that they don't want the parents have to

be the ones to make the decisions for

what's best for Mike for our kids it

can't be the government saying that it's

against the nuremberg laws yes that is

Rob Schneider performing an impromptu

rendition of his famous character the

annoying guy who is wrong because

because despite his misunderstanding of

among other things what the Nuremberg

Laws are and what constitutes acceptable

headwear for a grown man Snyder has

spoken out against mandatory vaccines

for years even once calling this

California state Assemblywoman to debate

the issue prompting her to post on

Facebook

be honest that is 20 minutes of my life

I'll never get back

arguing that vaccines don't cause autism

with deuce Bigalow male gigolo yeah sure

so it's funny it's funny but so hold on

lady let's not Sully the good name of

deuce Bigalow just because of something

that his portrayal Rob Schneider said

that's like implying William Wallace

doesn't trust Jews or officer Nordberg

is a murderer so no time separate the

two now now the good news is these days

very few people will say they are

completely anti-vaccine instead like the

president they'll say I'm not anti

vaccine but and it's what comes after

that but that we need to look at tonight

because one example is hey I'm not anti

vaccine but I am Pro safe vaccine and

and that can often refer to concern over

scary sounding ingredients like

thimerosal a mercury-based preservative

for years now RFK jr. has led a crusade

against it in fact just this year he

gave a speech where he said this for 33

years I've been working to get mercury

at fish nobody has ever called me any

fish and because I want mercury out of

vaccines I should not be called any

vaccine okay well for a start what would

anyone be ashamed to be called anti fish

fish are stupid and how do I know that

look at them just look at this idiot and

it's not just him check this moron out

as well and while you're at it what

about this dimwit here's another

bonehead for you I'm pretty sure this

dunks didn't make it past the third

grade

and I think we can all agree that this

doofus isn't exactly curing cancer oh

that's right

come at me fish oh I'm sorry you can't

kanya because because and that's because

after 500 million years you still

haven't figured out how to breathe air

you fish it's easy

I'm doing it now

even you don't know me fish get out of

here

you know what more importantly in

fact much more importantly it is worth

knowing that the mercury that has been

used in vaccines is not the same kind

that is harmful in fish on top of which

as with the MMR vaccine there have been

multiple large studies finding no link

between thimerosal and autism and

perhaps most importantly at all since

the early 2000s as a precautionary

measure it has been removed as a

preservative from all vaccines

recommended for infants except for the

flu vaccines and even there thimerosal

three versions are available so we

essentially spent time and energy

solving a problem that never existed

it's like spending years fighting to get

marshmallows out of Lucky Charms because

a few people think minions can choke to

death on them force our marshmallows

dissolve and minions don't exist and if

they did I would want them to choke to

death because those little will

murder us open your eyes and look if

you're thinking well hold on hold on if

it wasn't harmful why was it taken out

well there was intense public concern

that was amplified by people like then

congressman Dan Burton making arguments

like this I have not yet to find any

scientist who will say that there's no

doubt no doubt that the mercury in

vaccines does not contribute to autism

now they'll say there's no scientific

evidence there's no studies or anything

that proves that yet but turn that

around there are no studies that

disprove it either all right all right

okay

proving a negative is an impossible

standard and that is also a slippery

slope because it means that I can say to

you you Dan Burton are a donkey

you dress up donkeys in cheerleader

outfits and you thought them if what

you're into and you do it all

and you are saying to me for weight

there is absolutely no evidence of me

doing that but I would say turn that

around there's no evidence of you not

doing that either please and this is not

a road that you want to go down and the

thing is the thing is that donkey

is remarks actually get at why

scientists can be at a real disadvantage

in this debate because they by their

nature are careful in how they present

their conclusions science and English

are not really the same language and so

when a scientist says we have no

evidence that there's a link between

vaccines and autism what they're really

saying is you know we are as positive as

someone can humanly be that there's no

link and one thing that I sometimes do

when I'm talking to parents is say I'm

as confident that there's no link

between vaccines and autism as I am that

if I was going to walk off this building

that I would not be able to fly right

and that is about as clear as you can be

and for the record if your doctor does

believe they can fly run because they

are either crazy or they are are Kelly

and if your if your pediatrician is are

Kelly that things are actually the least

of your problem and I know I know that

some will say that the real problem is

that scientists have been paid by pharma

companies to hide the problems with

vaccines you can find countless memes

online about how the whole system is

corrupt some of which feature a very

smart looking cat and and I'm not saying

that there are not problems with Big

Pharma there absolutely are we have

discussed them before on this show but

on the rare occasions where there have

been issues with vaccines they have been

pulled and fast and I know that that

explanation will still not satisfy some

there are going to be some truly toxic

comments below this video

alongside the usual ones about how I

look like an owl who can't get a date

for prom

Oh or that I probably live alone

surrounded by jars I'm too weak to open

by myself and I think you're laughing

too hard at that and those comments will

link to the hidden truths about vaccines

and demand to know why I didn't look

into them and you know what we did look

into a lot of them and the problem is I

can go point by point by point and be

talking for hours tonight and this will

still never end it's like whack-a-mole

as one theory goes down another pops up

and I kind of get the insistence that

there must be a link at the age children

are supposed to get the MMR vaccine

happens to be the same age that

diagnosable signs of autism can begin to

appear but correlation is not causation

that is what scientific studies are for

and remember they are really clear that

link is not there and the problem with

spending more and more time and money

trying to prove that link is that it

takes resources away from studying

actual causes and treatments just listen

to the mother of one child with autism

who started a foundation precisely

because she wanted to find out the

causes we have dozens of studies I think

we were right to look at whether

vaccines might be a cause of autism but

there comes a point where there is so

much evidence none of which shows any

link between vaccines and autism that

you have to say enough yeah that's right

it's like that Einstein quotes is

sometimes see on the Internet the

definition of insanity is doing the same

thing over and over again and expecting

different results

except Einstein didn't say that because

and it seems I cannot stress this enough

means aren't fact and if you won't take

that from me take it from this very

smart looking cat

but again that that hyung of doubt it's

hard to shake off and some parents agree

with the president and they favor

hedging their bets and skipping or

spacing vaccines out just in case

93% of pediatricians say they've been

asked by parents to do just that and one

of the places that that idea may be

coming from is a pediatrician named dr.

Sears not bill sees the famous doctor

and author but his son Bob Sears dr. Bob

has made a name for himself with what

can seem like a sensible sounding

approach to address wide parents

concerns what I've put together is what

I call my alternative vaccine schedule

it's a way to get a baby fully

vaccinated that in a manner that spreads

the shots out a little bit and that

sounds like a decent compromise because

it's the middle ground position right

the problem is is the middle ground

between sense and nonsense

it's like saying it would be crazy to

eat that entire bar of soap

so I'll just eat half of it now the

enthusiasm for spacing vaccines out

stems from some parents belief that

children these days get too many shots

too soon perhaps best summed up by this

meme of a dog full of needles and I will

say if that's how they were given I

would oppose that but let's break that

fear down because while it is true that

children do receive more shots than they

used to the number of antigens in those

shots or the substances that induce the

immune response has greatly decreased

and it's a drop in the ocean compared to

the thousands of foreign antigens our

child usually encounters every day just

watch a child for five minutes and see

if they don't eat their friend's boogers

put their entire mouth over the water

Balcon or try and kiss a raccoon they

just found in a dumpster while playing

hide and seek my point is children are

disgusting

I even see it himself as of may be that

his approach is not based on scientific

research so where is that where is the

published peer-reviewed evidence to

support the notion of a quote overload

if you follow the CDC recommended

schedule where where does that exist

Chris I don't think there is any such

research and I actually never claimed

there was I certainly have put out there

very clearly in my writings that my

precautions on spreading out vaccines

are theoretical it's a theoretical

benefit to kids and it's a choice that I

think a lot of parents feel more

comfortable about and might actually

bring more parents to vaccinate if they

can spread the shots out more than the

regular schedule right except your job

is to make sure children don't get

deadly diseases not to make parents

comfortable because you're a

pediatrician not a flask of whiskey

tucked into a BabyBjorn dr. Bob

sometimes seems to be trying to have it

both ways because while he says he is

pro-vaccine and that he doesn't

explicitly tell parents to skip or delay

important shots his book just happens to

include an alternative vaccine schedule

and a selective vaccine schedule and on

that one you can get vaccinated for

measles as late as ten years old and on

top of that every once in a while he'll

drop a line like this you may may

statement I like to make on vaccine

there and autism is that vaccines don't

cause autism

except when they do and I know that

sounds like equivocating but

don't worry

opportunistic quacks writing books that

fanned the flames of people's unfounded

fears don't cause a legitimate public

health hazard except when they do

and what the benefits of dr. Sears in

plan are as he says theoretical the

dangers of spacing vaccines out are very

real the CDC says spreading shots out

puts children at risk of developing

diseases during the time that shots are

delayed and some of those diseases are

dangerous

measles alone was responsible for over a

hundred and thirty thousand deaths

worldwide in 2015 partly because it is

ridiculously infectious I'm talking

happy' by pharrell infectious I just

said that and it's already stuck in your

head now I'm happy there you go that's

how infectious measles is and one way we

can keep needles at bay is through

something called herd immunity that is

the concept whereby the more people who

are vaccinated the harder it is for a

disease to spread but the margin for

safety there is a lot smaller than you

may think

most experts say that the herd immunity

threshold for measles is around 95% but

when in France that dropped to 89% a few

years back this is what happened in 2007

there were around 40 cases of measles

across France then in 2008 a

ten-year-old girl returned from holiday

in Austria she went back to school and

played with some friends

several days later the girls became ill

the measles infection spread from

district to district inspecting the

susceptible population in 2011 there

were almost 15,000 cases at least six

people died okay so that clip proves two

things to us one a decrease in herd

immunity can have devastating

consequences and to anything is

terrifying if you play children's

singing frère Jacques underneath I

guarantee you that true just look at

what happens when you add that music

underneath this stock footage that we

found there is no way that those kids

are not about to be decapitated by a

stock pile no way if you're thinking

well you know that that is a chance I'm

willing to take it and I'm just making

this choice for my child

the thing is you're not you're putting

at risk kids like Rhett Crouch he was

diagnosed with leukemia at age two and

his immune system was weakened so much

he couldn't be vaccinated meaning if he

picked up a serious disease it could be

fatal and I'll let his mom take it from

here when he was first diagnosed he was

pretty much pulled out of society we

avoided highly concentrated groups of

people when we went out we were masks I

mean we really did limit his exposure

and we just were so excited for the day

when he could start kindergarten so he

could have that sense of socialization

and community and learning a year into

remission and back in school Rhett will

soon be healthy enough to be fully

vaccinated but until then his life

depends on herd immunity

exactly so by getting vaccinated you're

helping and protecting those who are

most vulnerable like sick people

and newborns too young to be vaccinated

and why would you choose not to do that

I believe Jesus Christ himself put it

best when he said do you seriously need

some sort of wise quote to convince you

on this one

just like don't be a dick and look I

know I honestly know but for some people

this is still hard but but what can help

is to try and anchor yourself to what we

know to be true about the risks of

vaccines and when it comes to autism

again there is no link and even when it

comes to other serious side effects like

a severe allergic reaction it is

literally according to the CDC close to

one in a million and I know that in a

way that's not actually helpful because

every parent thinks their child is one

in a million but if it makes you feel

better your child's odds of being

convicted of murder and eventually

executed by the state are only one in a

hundred and nineteen thousand and twelve

yes and if that makes you feel even

worse just cheer up maybe your child

will be one of those murderers that

never gets course maybe they're very

smart clearly and you know maybe one of

the biggest problems here is that when

people hear about vaccines so much of

the emphasis is on non-existence or

wildly unlikely harms and and we tend

not to talk about the very tangible good

that they do after all nobody is going

on facebook to post didn't get polio

again today

so less and maybe we kind of should

because it is easy to forget the

benefits of vaccines are enormous what

we have seen in the industrialized world

is essentially all of the major

epidemics they've vanished mums today

have every expectation that their

beautiful little baby will live and not

be polished off by de faria by Tiffany's

even occasionally by meals now that is

the transformation in young lives that

vaccines are brought and that is a

really good point

only slightly undercut by him using the

phrase polished off because it's talking

about babies not a rack of ribs here's

the thing it really comes down to this

it is likely done at some point you may

hear scary vaccine stories from other

parents or on the internet and it is

hard not to be terrified

when you encounter it and that is partly

because Parenthood in general is

terrifying

believe me I'm someone who is scared of

literally everything the dark the light

Heights depths confined spaces wide open

spaces strangers intimacy spiders and a

sudden and mysterious lack of spiders

but all of that but for what is wrong

and if this helps at all I have a son he

is 19 months old he was born prematurely

following a very difficult pregnancy and

I've worried about his health and I'm

still worried about it helped a lot but

we are vaccinating him fully on schedule

and if I can overcome the temptation to

listen to the electoral shouting of my

terrified lizard brain then I believe

that everyone can

racism you know the problem that crash

failed to solve specifically we're going

to discuss school segregation which it

turns out is still a big problem

racial segregation is on the rise the

number of schools where 1% are less if

the student population is white has more

than doubled in the last 20 years that's

true even as our society has grown more

diverse nearly 7,000 schools have the

same racial makeup as the audience of

your average Tyler Perry movie and that

one white guy is Leonard Maltin and he

has to be there it's his job boo

Ahmadiyya Halloween three stars now at

this point if you are in a city like New

York you're probably thinking Oh

splendid

I know where this is going a story

vilifying the backwards and racist

American South let me just grab a

handful of kale chips that I can munch

on while feeling superior well hold on

there is something you should probably

know according to the UCLA Civil Rights

Project the south is the least

segregated region for black students and

in fact New York State is now the most

segregated system in America

in large part due to New York City oh

we're standing

you will racist the whole time put back

those persons you bought yourselves as a

trip from fairway you don't deserve them

anymore and look it would still be

problematic even if these schools were

roughly equivalent academically as that

would still be a violation of the

principle of Brown versus Board of

Education that separate educational

facilities are inherently unequal but in

practice they are very rarely equal in

any way black and Latino children are

more likely to attend schools with

inexperienced teachers which are then

less likely to offer a college prep

curriculum on top of which because race

and class are inextricably linked those

students are six times as likely to be

in high poverty schools and while there

are teachers and students working

incredibly hard in those places they are

often doing so with fewer resources as

warm student learned during a school

exchange program once a year we do

what's called a school swap where

students that go to County High School's

attend a school in the city for one day

and then students in the city attend a

school in the county for one day I went

in and the first thing that I noticed

actually was all this stuff around her

I'm talking about stuff that looked like

it cost lots of money the teacher come

in they can get right on topic they have

multiple computers that they can use

it's like wow and then I related back to

my school well we don't have all that

okay I get what that program was trying

to do but it still seems cruel giving

students a glimpse of what other kids

are getting at least on a plane they

cover first class with a curtain and

sure they might still bake cookies and

waft the smell down the aisle but that's

just a with you so how is it possible

that our nation schools are by some

measures more segregated now than they

have been in over four decades well it

turns out places like New York haven't

so much resegregate 'add as never really

bothered integrating in the first place

because the 1964 Civil Rights Act was

very carefully crafted by northern

lawmakers it targeted the kind of

segregation by law which existed in the

south so you couldn't have a school that

was officially designated

whites-only but it exempted the

so-called racial imbalance of northern

schools so if a New York school was all

white because it was drawing from an

all-white area even if that area had

been kept that way due to a host of

explicitly racist housing policies that

was somehow fine and if you're thinking

that is some hypocritical you

are not alone Malcolm X was pointing

this out in New York at the time you

don't have to go to Mississippi to find

a segregated school system we have it

right here in New York City it shows

that the problems that there are the

white liberals have been pointing the

finger at this southern segregationist

and condemning them for exists right

here in New York City yeah of course

racism exists in New York have you never

seen West Side Story it is a musical

about love transcending the obstacle of

one person being Porto Rican it'll never

work and for what it's worth when on

rare occasions northern cities were

forced to desegregate things got just as

ugly as they did down south listen to

one Boston man described his memories of

being sent to a school in a white

neighborhood so my first day of school

was when we walked got off the school

bus was ID under step in white paint

niggers go back home to Africa you got

all these whites out to you but right

you know you know signs calling us

niggas you know go back home and then

did somebody saying kids you would see

in class so now you're like so what's up

with that yeah he's got a point there

they shall go home to Africa and then

sit beside you in class I do hope the

kids who heard that had the opportunity

to go oh you want to borrow a pencil

well I'm sorry I must have left mine in

Kenya this morning space

of the general paranoia surrounding this

issue back then just watch this trailer

for a movie called halls of anger a

handful of white students are

transferred to an all-black school you

know there's gonna be trouble vanilla

ice cream and I'm gonna take me a big

lick okay

that is clearly horrible but on a side

note using the terms chocolate and

vanilla is actually the best possible

argument for bringing races closer

together because what happens when you

combine chocolate and vanilla I'll tell

you what happens fudgie the

whale happens and it is superb and even

though the path to integration was rough

and the burden often fell

disproportionately on african-american

communities there were still clear

benefits because bringing in white

children also brought in resources to an

almost comical extent immediately when

the decision was made that white kids

would now be bused into West Charlotte

it was like a community joke like

overnight the gravel parking lot was

paved the athletic facilities in terms

of the football stadium basketball

gymnasium stuff was upgraded it was like

overnight someone had written a check

for a million dollars exactly funding

tends to follow white people around the

way white people follow the band fish

around it's a different show every time

man

last time I was rolling because I

snorted money off the communal

didgeridoo different show every time man

that man's school was in Charlotte North

Carolina a city which became a model for

how desegregation could be effective by

the end of the 1980s just 1 percent of

Latino children and 3 percent of black

children were attending schools

considered racially isolated that is 90%

or more minority and this was such a

point of pride that when President

Reagan visited and tried to talk

about Charlotte's system it didn't go

down too well they favored busing that

take centers and children out of the

neighborhood school and makes them pawns

in a social experiment that nobody wants

we found out it failed I don't call that

compassion Reagan got no reaction from

the crowd on that line I took great

offense to that not stopped across the

floor and said a few choice expletives

about to present it and cut out the TV

well that is some courtly southern

aggression I'm guessing his choice

expertise were heavens to Betsy that

really fried my grits and sir you are a

scoundrel without valor without Weller I

say

unfortunately what happened next in

Charlotte is basically the story of

desegregation in a nutshell because in

1997 a white parent got upset when his

daughter lost out in a lottery for a

magnet school which had reserved some

seats for black children and even though

she was still assigned to one of the top

ten elementary schools in the state he

filed a lawsuit I really believe that my

daughter's constitutional rights were

violated and as a concerned parent and a

responsible parent I hope I believed it

was my job to look after her well-being

okay sure but she was already in a

top-ten school and I do get making sure

that your kid has a good education is

one of the most important jobs a parent

can do it's right up there with lying

about not having a favorite child

because every parent has a favorite

child and it's Dylan it's not you it's

not any of your siblings it's Dylan just

ask your parents they like Dylan he does

his own laundry but but that man's

selfishness had a huge impact a federal

judge ruled in his favor vacating the

district's desegregation plan and

basically blowing up the whole thing and

tragically Charlotte then experienced

Swift re-segregation as by 2010 those 1

and 3 percent figures for Latinos and

blacks had grown to 44 and 47 percent

and I know it is tempting to be angry at

that one parent especially because and

this is true before the verdict even

came down he moved his family to

California which is the constitutional

challenge equivalent of farting in a

crowded elevator just as you're stepping

off of it

but to be fair this wasn't an isolated

incident all over the country

desegregation plans were struck down

thanks in part to Supreme Court rulings

making it easier to challenge them and

the prevailing narrative became that

desegregated desegregation imposed to

higher cost on students for a benefit

that was no longer necessary it's an

attitude that's best summed up by this

Louisiana State Senator do you think

that you have to bust children all over

a bossom long distance so you can say

you sit in a seat next to someone

diverse different from yourself the

Justice Department you know they achieve

their goal who can say we're not

desegregated you know an

african-american president we have an

african-american mayor here in Baton

Rouge what a majority white in the

parish we've been through all that and

there it is the idea that because

President Obama was elected systemic

racism was pretty much solved which is

absolutely absurd because racism is not

one of those things that just disappears

on its own in due time it's not like

chicken pox or Chewbacca mom and I know

I know I have just restarted the clock

on that one and I am genuinely sorry so

the only solution here is to be

proactive because remember if you just

assigned kids to their neighborhood

schools and their neighborhoods are

segregated you will have a segregated

school and clearly there are some

parents who it seems would resist just

about anything that might result in

integration just listen to how these

parents in st. Louis reacted to the idea

of students from a mostly black

community being added to their schools

so a big district send my son to a

better school when this one goes down

I deserve to not have to worry about my

children getting fat or getting robbed

because that B issue oh that is not

subtle

she's just a homies and a baggy pants

away from full dog whistle bingo and

look those parents are all extreme

examples but even if for a moment you

give everyone the benefit of the doubt

and you assume that all complaints about

bus schedules or class sizes are

actually just about buses or class sizes

the hard truth is you don't have to be

intentionally racist to do things that

have racist effects in the 60s if you

had insisted on separate lunch counters

not because you hated black people but

just because you loved your son so much

you wanted him to get his lunch quicker

the end result would have been exactly

the same and while I get the impulse to

seize every tiny advantage you can for

your kid I get that segregated schools

cause devastating harm to actual

children and not just to their education

but to their very sense of self-worth

you don't have support at all we have

black books resources anything you can

think of but when we go in contact with

these white children or a subset

Caucasian they don't know how to act

because they believe that they're better

than us and we don't know how to act

because we believe that they're better

than us and that is heartbreaking

because classrooms should teach children

about the importance of self-esteem not

rip it from them because that is what

prom is for and and there can be lasting

positive impacts to integration not

because the mere act of having a white

classmate is somehow magic it's not

unless of course that kid has round

glasses or scar on his forehead and sits

alone on parents visiting day but but

getting to attend a good middle-class

school can be transformative Berkeley

professor Rocco Johnson studied black

siblings where one went to a

desegregated school and the other didn't

and not only did those exposed to more

years of desegregation fare better but

their kids did too and that is not all

blacks who attended desegregated

elementary schools were more likely to

graduate and

22% less likely to be incarcerated as

adults

what is more Johnson found that the

narrowing of the achievement gap and the

increased success of black Americans did

not have any negative effect on whites

on any metric so it was good for black

people and have no effect on white

people whatsoever it's like this

canister of black and sassy cream shine

I am pretty sure I can make that joke

hold on hold on which writer pitched in

that doesn't help the point is for

white children a lack of experience with

people of other races can have serious

downsides just watch one young girl take

a racial bias test show me the good

child why is she the good child connect

into a fight move okay show me the bad

child why is she the bad child she's a

lot darker what do you think shocking to

you I just think it's because she's not

exposed exactly and that is why it is

important to expose kids to other races

at a young age you don't want your child

playing guess who and a birthday party

and asking is this person bad to rule

out anyone who isn't white and what and

while yes you can absolutely teach kids

about racism in the abstract if your

school is overwhelmingly white important

nuances can get lost as this second

grader found after making a bold choice

for a school project I have a dream

today I have a dream that my four little

children

they live in a nation sean is portraying

a historical figure assigned by his

teacher

well monolith the King jr. he said mom I

want to wear suit because that's what he

wore and a black tie and I have to wear

a white shirt and he said I'm also I

want to play you know do my face and

black they thought it was inappropriate

and it would be disrespectful to black

people but I say that it's not I like

that people okay

first Wow second it is obviously not

that kids fault II didn't know any

better and finally if Martin Luther King

jr. could see that clip I legitimately

don't know whether he'd be thrilled or

horrified he might actually be both he'd

be like wow I really made a difference

to a point so so the benefits of truly

diverse schools are obvious the problem

is often just our willingness to do it

at all and to their credit some school

districts including Charlotte and now

looking for ways to fix things and there

are models small and large around the

country for what can work Boston has

long had a voluntary program to send

kids from the city to schools in the

suburbs it's tiny but it's wildly

popular and Louisville has created a

complicated school assignment formula

that has resulted in more integrated

schools it is not perfect and they've

had to tweak it a lot but it is worth

knowing that under that program

90% of kindergarten families still

received their first choice of schools

which is impressive because I doubt 90%

of those families even received their

first choice of kindergartner I mean

she's great she's great she she draws on

a lot of things but she's great she's

she's fine she's absolutely fine she's

no Dylan of course because as we all

know Dylan is the best and everyone

should be invested in those sorts of

solutions because because while this

always gets framed as an issue about

parents and their children

it's actually about adults and everybody

because kids grow up and those little

doctors soldiers police officers and

superheroes asking you for candy

tomorrow night well in a decade or so

they might be actual doctors soldiers

police officers and assistant directors

of human resources

and there are massive and multiple

benefits for all of us if they

interacted a lot more from an early age

and I know this seems like a lot to ask

but in the words of a small white child

dressed as a dead civil rights leader I

have a dream

you

once the envy of all employees who work

in open-plan offices I would take a king

beaded curtain just so I don't have to

directly observe Carol clipper nails do

it at home Carol what this year one

particular wall has gotten a lot of our

attention I will build a great great

wall on our southern border at the Trump

walk beautiful walk I will build the

greatest wall that you've ever seen they

ever put my name on I want a gorgeous

wall the Trump wall will that be a

beautiful one yes Donald Trump wants to

build a wall on the US Mexican border

and based on his tone he also wants to

that wall the was such excited

fixture of his speeches of so popular

among his supporters one man even wore a

spandex war costume one of his rallies

and I mean that's kind of incredible the

only group of people more excited about

barriers are high school health teachers

oh that's right cool guys and cool girls

when you're horny there is nothing

better than a good dental dam it feels

exactly the same it doesn't it really

doesn't

the border wall is one of the few policy

proposals Trump has talked about in

detail so instead of mocking or

dismissing it out of hand tonight let's

take a series proposal by a serious

presidential candidate seriously and

first let's put aside the potential

racism and xenophobia involved here we

can come back to that later and instead

let's focus on the practicality of

whether and how it can actually be done

and let's start with the cost when Trump

first started talking about this he said

it would cost a lot but not a lot a lot

let's say the world costs 4 billion you

know they say 10 billion that means 4

billion if you know what you're doing ok

so so so he's saying he could build a

wall at 40% of what it would cost others

which I would say is an insane magic

trick if I thought his tiny fingers

could wrap all the way around a magic

wand but since then his estimate has

grown the wall is going to call six or

seven billion walls probably eight

billion dollars a wall gets built it's

gonna cost ten billion dollars to build

a wall okay it's a lot of money to wall

the walls gonna cost ten billion dollars

maybe twelve depending okay so we've

gone from four to twelve billion dollars

Donald Trump's margin of error is the

entire GDP of Moldova but still fair

enough we're now at 12 billion dollars

but but to truly know the real cost

we're gonna need to know what the wall

is going to be made from now if only

Donald Trump could explain that to me

like I'm a child you're going to build

the wall what's it going to be made out

of

hey that's a good question lift him up

here bring him up here gonna be made of

hardened concrete and it's gonna be made

out of rebar and steel okay first first

Trump is holding that child less like a

human being and more like a cat's he

just gave a bath to but but second

second to be fair rebar and steel okay

that is a clear answer I appreciate that

now now the amount we would need would

depend on the height of the wall

unfortunately Trump has been unclear on

that suggesting numbers ranging from 35

to 90 feet so let's work with his lowest

estimate at a 35 foot tall wall which

Trump has said we would need around a

thousand miles off now according to one

estimator and construction economists

that would cost 10 billion dollars for

the concrete panels and 5 to 6 billion

for steel columns including labor plus

another billion for concrete footing for

the columns and a concrete foundation so

that's at least 16 billion dollars

we're already four billion over his

largest budget and we've only just

gotten started here because those

materials are heavy and you're gonna

have to transport them into many areas

that are currently inaccessible to

construction vehicles so that same

expert estimates another two billion

dollars to build roads so that 20-ton

trucks can deliver those materials and

that's not even getting into another 30%

or so for engineering design and

management so now we're up to around

twenty five billion dollars anywhere

from two to six times Trump's estimates

but wait because we're still not done

all of that is just building a wall the

Congressional Budget Office estimated

for a similar project that wall

maintenance costs would exceed the

initial construction costs within seven

years so it's a big dumb thing that only

gets more expensive over time it's like

getting a pet walrus you think it's

stupid now what until you learn what a

bucket of sea cucumbers costs

you've not prepared for that but but

whatever the cost is Trump claims he has

got a way to pay for it Mexico is going

to pay for the war

going to pay for the war Mexico is going

to pay for the war Mexico is gonna pay

for the wall and they're gonna be happy

about it of course they are of course

that people love it when you make them

pay for they don't want that's why

everyone is so happy when their cable

company bundles together cable internet

and landline that will come in handy

when I need to call my cell phone

because I can't find it and that's about

it but is Mexico going to pay for the

wall because the current Mexican

Treasury Secretary has said Mexico under

no circumstance is going to pay for the

wall that mr. Trump is proposing and two

former Mexican presidents were even

clearer Mexican people we are not going

to pay any single cent for a such a

stupid wall as you care I'm not gonna

fail you for that I think the best part

of that clip is the fact that he even

took the extra effort to swear in

English hey this may be my second

language but I want to make absolutely

sure youth understand it but when Trump

was asked about these comments he

responded with characteristic diplomacy

the wall just got 10 feet taller believe

me ten feet tall come on things don't

get bigger just because you're angry if

that were true Alec Baldwin would be a

hundred feet tall by now now to be fair

to be fair here Trump has thought

through how he will get Mexico to foot

the bill we have right now a fifty eight

billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico

that's why the wall gets built by the

way that's why they're gonna pay for it

okay I see I think Mexico will pay

because we have a trade deficit I

understand unfortunately that's

literally not how anything works because

well yes we did buy fifty eight billion

dollars more in goods and services from

Mexico than they did from us last year

that money doesn't belong to the Mexican

government it's earned by Mexican

businesses it's not lying around in some

centralized scrooge mcduck

been labeled dumb Americans money do not

spend on border fence let's put all this

aside and let's say we did find the

money where would we put a border wall

now your instinct says on the border but

even that is actually more difficult

than it sounds and we know this because

in 2006 George W Bush scientist secure

Fence Act which called for the

construction of 700 miles of fencing

along the border a project which

incidentally then senators Barack Obama

and Hillary Clinton voted for which is

terrible although keep in mind that

millions of you voted for Taylor Hicks

in 2006 so we don't be quite so quick to

judge

so patrol that fence that vets ran into

a lot of problems though for instance in

large stretches of Texas the border

consists of the Rio Grande and typically

you can't build a wall along the river

as a 1970 treaty prohibits building

anything that may cause obstruction of

normal flow of the river and for that

and other reasons some stretches of the

border fence were built considerably

inland and as towns like Brownsville

Texas have learned that can be a problem

this here is the Rio Grande River as

cuts all the way you can see it makes a

natural Crescent there this is Mexico

all back here here's where the walls

built so all of this golf course is now

stuck in between Mexico and this border

fence it's true that golf course was

stuck between the u.s. border fence and

Mexico in a space that like the case of

Diablo Pajarito occurred over isn't

really American but sure as isn't

Mexican

as the ridiculousness of this situation

was not lost on the people who played

there you realize when you're golfing

here that you're in them you're not

really in the United States or Mexico

here

I don't care where I am as long as I'm

off course you think it's helping with

security no I think I think that woman

just said in two words what I'm taking

20 minutes to say in this piece does the

fence help no stupid I look Texas became

a real problem for constructing that

fence because in Texas unlike in other

states there is no federally owned

buffer along the Mexican border meaning

the land is mostly owned by private

citizens like the loop family who owned

a ranch in Texas and discovered that

three-quarters of their land would

suddenly be on the other side of the

fence

when Homeland Security asked the loops

to sign away rights to their land for

the fence they said no way I'm not

finding anything at this point

nothing this is not possible so the

government used the power of eminent

domain and condemned their property Wow

and the loops were not alone hundreds of

property owners were sued by the federal

government so the fence could be built

perhaps the only silver lining here

might be that historically in America

when the federal government takes your

land and treats you terribly

you at least get an offensive football

team named after you so I guess one day

we can all look forward to the

Washington loops hey it's a sign of

respect that respecting their heritage

why can't you understand that and the

fences damage didn't stop there because

Michael Chertoff then Secretary of

Homeland Security signed a document

giving his department the authority to

waive 36 laws to build the fence

including the Endangered Species Act the

Safe Drinking Water Act and the Native

American graves protection and

repatriation Act he even welded parts of

the fence himself wearing an American

Eagle facemask and he looks like a

member of Daft Punk

if Daft Punk played nothing but Lee

Greenwood covers

and that Native American grave laws came

in horrifyingly handy as this Native

American leader explains fragments of

human remains were found in heavy

equipment tracks on the Christian ranch

archaeological site a site now crossed

by barrier barriers and the border road

imagine a bulldozer in your family

graveyard I mean say what you will but I

think imagine a bulldozer in your family

graveyard is definitely the worst verse

of John Lennon's Imagine it's not my

favorite it is not my favorite and by

waiving the protections for wildlife the

fence has posed dangers to the survival

in the u.s. of everything from Jaguars

to pronghorns to pygmy owls and look how

shocked they look by that fact although

although I will admit they do

permanently look like you've just

murdered their entire families Trump

might well argue having a wall is worth

all of this because it will act as a

fortress to stop people and drugs

flowing across the border but let's look

at that because the most recent

authoritative estimate suggests nearly

half of the unauthorized migrants in the

u.s. entered legally through a port

eventually like an airport or a border

crossing usually with visas that they

then overstayed a wall can't stop that

it's like wearing a condom to protect

against head lice you could do that but

that's not really how you keep the thing

you're worried about from happening

which is not to say that there are not

some people crossing the border where a

wall would be but what a wall really

stopped them what the Border Patrol says

and I've spoken to a lot of their people

is look first of all if you build a

30-foot wall all its gonna do is create

a market for 31-foot ladders of course

of course that's right and I by the way

remember when you're looking for a

31-foot ladder avoid Werner climbing a

werner ladder is like dousing yourself

in cooking grease and climbing a pile of

tetanus do yourself a favor and get into

walt ladder and i'm not being paid to

say that i'm just a fan

a very happy customer and ladders are

not the walls only weakness watch as

Donald Trump inadvertently stumbles his

way into a key realization so you take

precast plank it comes 30 feet along 40

feet along 50 feet long there's no

ladder going over that if they ever get

up there they're in trouble cuz there's

no way to get down maybe you're up yeah

this may be a rope yes yes your

brilliant plan has been undone by

mankind's third invention and as for

stopping drugs walls and fences have not

posed much of a challenge to cartels in

Mexico police have discovered a tunnel

believed to have been used to smuggle

drugs into the u.s. using this makeshift

cannon they were shooting packages small

packages of marijuana across the border

these men were actually using a catapult

to launch drugs across the border other

smugglers have kept it a bit simpler

than that they just get somebody with a

really good arm who throws it over the

fence like a football okay okay well

we'll say if they're looking for a new

recruit

I know Peyton Manning is currently

between jobs but let's face it for many

people efficacy is beside the point

this wall is about making us feel safer

and here is where the racism and

xenophobia that we put aside at the top

of this piece really needs to be brought

back because while other politicians

have supportive barriers at the border

Donald Trump has been uncommonly clear

about who we need to be protected from

when Mexico sends its people they're not

sending their best they're bringing

drugs they're bringing crime they're

rapists and some I assume are good

people

Trump Trump sounds like an angry

villager running through the town square

yelling werewolves Run For Your Lives

though some I assume are good werewolves

but they're here to kill you with maybe

a few exceptions but mostly werewolves

run run

we're werewolves love me and I love

werewolves but they're here to kill all

of us but but about that because while

yes individual undocumented immigrants

have committed horrible crimes so

obviously have American citizens and in

fact researchers consistently find that

immigrants are less not more crime prone

than their native-born counterparts the

crime rates among immigrants once here

are relatively tiny digits which is

something Donald Trump should frankly

understand given that he has ten of them

attached take these minuscule you wish

to say that the idea of the war is not

still comforting for some people or as

one man who actually lives near the

border puts it this was put out to

illustrate to Joe whoever up in Dubuque

or someplace they see a picture of this

and they're overstuffed butts and an

overstuffed chair looking at a to big TV

think oh yeah that'll stop them well of

course it doesn't this guy is amazing

on the fat cat out of touch

metropolis that is Dubuque Iowa but even

if it does make the people of Dubuque

feel safer given everything we've seen

is it worth it because remember we

calculated earlier that this could

conservatively cost twenty five billion

dollars excluding the cost of both

maintenance and the land under it that

works out to around seventy seven

dollars per person and here is where I

would like to make a counterproposal to

Donald Trump's wall plan if the main

thing is going to get us is a warm sense

of satisfaction inside I suggest instead

of building that wall we use the money

to buy every man woman and child in

America a parmer waffle iron these

beauties retail at $75 apiece so we'd

still have nearly a billion dollars left

over and just to be clear this isn't one

per household this is one per person you

have five people in your family you got

five waffle irons coming your way

not only is this cost-effective unless

you are a really sick this waffle

iron plan would not kill a single pygmy

owl I know what you're thinking John

this is a stupid idea but is it is it

really yes

obviously it is but is it significantly

stupider than Donald Trump's wall

because this waffle iron plan will cost

less it'll do nearly as much to keep out

immigrants and drugs it won't harm our

relationship with our third largest

trading partner if it is racist it's

only toward Belgians and and unlike

Donald Trump's wall

this makes king waffles what kind of

country do we want to wake up to one

that spends billions on an impossible

impractical symbol of fear or one that

smells like breakfast

exactly

as you know our show is dedicated to

covering the biggest news of the week

whatever that news may be we have a long

proud one-week history of doing that so

what was the biggest news story of this

week we begin in Oklahoma tonight with

an execution that didn't go as planned

a convicted killer from Oklahoma dies

after a botched execution

okay okay okay I know what you're

thinking you're thinking white you know

you're not gonna really do a comic take

on the death penalty right it's your

second episode I haven't even decided if

I like this show yet

well you're right don't change the

channel we don't have to talk about the

death penalty no one is forcing us to in

the application of the death penalty in

this country we have seen significant

problems I think we do have to as a

society ask ourselves some some

difficult and profound questions do we

do we really have to do that can you not

just answer those question for us

because I do not want to talk about the

death penalty and judging by the noise

that you make when you talk about it

neither do you what happened in Oklahoma

is deeply troubling

I know that sound that's the sound of a

man drowning on dry land desperately

hoping for Biden to suddenly walk out

into the gopro's garden in an open road

oh god John Oh Jose here thank god

you're here ah let's lighten the mood

everyone let's talk about Benghazi okay

okay so let's do this then let's talk

about the death penalty and before you

turn this show off there was a YouTube

video this week of tiny hamsters eating

tiny burrito it's as magical and as

uncomplicated as you think and if you

make it to the end of this story I

promise we will watch it together okay

so you have to stay with us you have to

stay with us to get it okay so the death

penalty should it exist and what should

its limits be can someone give me a

broad almost infantile guideline of when

they think it's appropriate the Supreme

Court has already told us that the death

penalty is constitutional I will do

believe in the death penalty but but

only with respect to those who are

guilty of committing the crime okay

bones idea

we shouldn't execute innocent people I

think most people would probably agree

with that you sir are a regular Atticus

Finch but but executing the innocent is

not really the tough question here is

whether we should be executing the

guilty and let me acknowledge right up

front that I come to this as a bit of an

outsider Britain does not have capital

punishment so in a way I really don't

know what I'm talking about

but in another way I really do know what

I'm talking about because before 1965 we

didn't just have capital punishment we

literally went medieval on people's

asses the history of capital punishment

in Britain is a long and bloody one

since the Middle Ages laws condemned to

death have variously faced the

boiled alive burnt at the stake or hung

drawn and quartered yeah we did that we

boils people and in the grand tradition

of British cuisine if anything we over

boiled them we boil them up

we we loved killing people so much we

kept coming up with new inventive

techniques that look like they were

designed by the marquis de sade and

named by willy wonka this is the head

crusher the small and seemingly

innocuous thumb biter originates in 14th

century Scotland these devices have

almost childlike names like penny

Winkies that's right

penny wink is a delightful English

cousin of the throaty tugtug and the

jolly shocky buzz-buzz tickly wickley

since I know I know that all of this is

still technically horrifying but that's

kind of the point because whether you

are boiling people alive or putting them

to sleep with a tiny injection

administered by a puppy dressed as

Winnie the Pooh in the end you are

getting the same result and here's the

thing just because the British people

don't have the death penalty anymore

doesn't mean that we don't want it back

recent polls suggest that at least half

the population would choose to have it

reinstated which makes complete sense

because the death penalty is one of

those things that is natural to want but

you shouldn't necessarily have the death

penalty is like the McRib when when you

can't have it it's so tantalizing but as

soon as they bring it back you think

this is epically wrong should this be

allowed in a civilised society and by

the way there is your new slogan Magrib

you are welcome you are welcome you can

have that for free that's yours

because because there are things about

having the death penalty which might

make you a little bit queasy what does

the United States have in common with

Iran Iraq and Saudi Arabia the answer is

the death penalty according to Amnesty

International those four nations and

China are responsible for 82 percent of

the world's executions look this is

gonna seem like a gross simplification

but any list that contains Iran Iraq

Saudi Arabia and China is not a list you

want to be on ideally you want to be on

one of those lists that Finland is on

Finland Finland is on all the good lists

like countries with the best pastries or

best countries to host your overseas

lesbian wedding and I know I know what

some of you are thinking but John I hear

you saying that most Western countries

no longer have executions but if someone

committed a heinous crime I would still

very much like to kill them okay well

let's start with if there have been 312

DNA exonerations in this country since

we've been doing forensic testing one

life in parole how things which were

once considered complete airtight

evidence against somebody are now sort

of being viewed as junk shut science

isn't it interesting is interesting

really the word that you're looking for

there Cooper facts found on Snapple caps

are interesting that the Statue of

Liberty's nose is four feet six inches

long hot that's an interesting fact

but facts like innocent people are

potentially executed by our government

on a regular basis and not so much

interesting as horrifying put it

this way if you found that on the bottom

of a Chobani lid that would like I can

tell you of Chobani even harder to

swallow than it already is and look look

statistics suggest that false

convictions aren't all that rare I this

week we are learning from the

Proceedings of the National Academy of

Sciences a study that shows four percent

of death row inmates are innocent

I think you might be using the wrong

tone 4%

well the outrage about this must be off

the charts I remember a certain Texas

governor who felt that for individual

cases of voter impersonation in the last

decade was a moral issue important to

address thank any person who does not

want to see fraud believes in having

good open honest elections transparent

well we take it to the Supreme Court to

the Supreme Court over a voter

impersonation rate essentially close to

zero percent so a potential executing

the innocent rate of 4% must really eat

away at Rick Perry your state has

executed 234 death row inmates more than

any other governor in modern times have

you have you struggled to sleep at night

with the idea that any one of those

might have been innocent no sir I've

never struggled with that at all nope I

never struggled with it in fact I sleep

great like a big muscular baby 14 hours

or not legs in the air with a mobile

above my head crying when I myself

I'm a big baby I sleep like a baby but

ok ok let's imagine for a moment a

magical world where you could be sure of

someone's guilt what are the arguments

for killing them then is it that it's a

deterrent to others there is no credible

evidence that the death penalty is a

particular deterrent to violent crime

although to be fair the death penalty is

an amazing deterrent to fishing without

a license

listen Todd I'd love to go with you but

is it worth it you've got a wife and

children so what about the argument then

that we shouldn't have to pay to house

and feed a convicted killer an average

death penalty case

cost the state millions of dollars in

California alone since 1978 the total

cost of enforcing the death penalty has

been over four billion dollars that's

308 million dollars for each of the 13

executions carried out in fact it costs

up to 10 times more to give someone the

death penalty than life in prison so

what a death sentence is really saying

is hey this is America and the way we

treat the most despicable members of our

society is by spending the entire budget

of the Lord of the Rings trilogy on them

so what what we know now is the death

penalty is expensive potentially kills

innocent people and doesn't deter crime

and here is where it gets hard harder

than is potentially appropriate for a

comedy show late on a Sunday night but

if we are going to answer difficult and

profound questions as the president told

us to the toughest one is probably if

someone is guilty of committing a

horrible crime and the family of the

victim want the perpetrator executed do

we want to live in the kind of country

that gives that to them I would say no

you might very reasonably say yes or at

the very least

but

but it's a question that is going to

need an answer and in the meantime a

much easier question is do you want to

watch a YouTube video of a tiny hamster

eating a tiny burrito it's at this point

at this point you have earned it

and that is how you end a comprehensive

segment on the death penalty

astroturfing which sounds like a new

teen trend of artificial grass

while eating cascade pods that's right

the teens have moved on from tide it's

all about cascade now astroturf ping is

the practice of corporations or

political groups disguising themselves

as spontaneous authentic popular

movements it's basically fake grassroots

that's why they call it astroturf II

it's a very funny very clever name

now you're probably familiar with

astroturf II as a concept from C ads by

groups with a generic populist sounding

names like Americans against food taxis

delivering weirdly specific messages

like these Washington is talking about a

new tax on Jews rates of soda they say

it's only pennies

well those pennies add up when you're

trying to feed a family

Washington if you're listening but

doesn't seem like much to you can be a

lot to us

tell Congress no taxes on juice drinks

and sodas well it won't surprise you to

learn that Americans against food taxes

was not started by regular Americans

pooling their resources together to take

out a large ad buy on national TV about

their number one problem priority a

proposed soda tax no it was a front

group for the food and beverage industry

which makes a lot more sense soda

companies have a lot of money at least

enough to convince the LeBron James to

pretend he drinks sprite sprite diabetes

you can taste and and well you might

think well yeah but that's obvious I'd

never fall for astroturf like

that

don't be quite so sure because with dark

money surging in the wake of decisions

like citizens united astroturf

techniques are now becoming more

sophisticated effective and dangerous

and they are not going away so tonight

we thought it might be useful to take a

look at some of those techniques to help

us better spot them in the future

let's just start with the names

themselves because sometimes groups are

created with deliberately misleading

names for instance the group save our

tips which purportedly speaks for

waitstaff is an anti minimum wage

increase group funded by restaurant

owners the National wetlands coalition

worked on behalf of oil companies and

real estate developers and the American

Council on science and health has been

funded by among other things

fracking interests soda companies each

cigarette companies and chemical

manufacturers so it's pure straight-up

opposite world it's like if this show is

called funny time happy hour with

shuttle honks John Oliver

it's just demonstrable false we can't

back that up and look it's not

always easy to spot exactly what the

group's motive is especially with an ad

like this don't eat here

what's with your people tossing money at

the Humane Society of the United States

these HSUS losers aren't even affiliated

with your local pet shelter for more

information go to humane watch.org that

is a very strange ad because first of

all if you're going to have a talking

dog what would you make him such a gruff

asshole hey I'm Tony and I'm mad

the Humane Society's a bunch of losers

and if you disagree you can suck my dark

dick

and second second who would take out an

attack ad on the Humane Society a rival

even humane er society puppy mills

self-loathing dogs it's impossible to

say for sure all I can tell you is that

ad is the work of Rick Berman

a PR expert who's known in the industry

as dr. evil he is known for his defences

of controversial products from

secondhand smoke to trans fats to payday

loans he's also created nonprofit groups

that have fought regulation of all of

those things in fact it's one of those

groups the concentr the Center for

Consumer Freedom which was credited on

that Humane Society attack ad so if is

the Center for Consumer Freedom a front

group full Berman's corporate clients is

it at all relevant that Rick Berman has

shown up at events for the pork industry

and industry which has been targeted by

the Humane Society in the past for the

use of gestation crates or as Rick

Berman insists on calling them maternity

pens I can't say I legally can't say I

want to are badly wanted but I've been

explicitly told I can't you can probably

guess but I can't say it out loud what I

can say is that Berman rejects any

accusation that he runs front groups for

corporate clients saying there is no

front because there is total

transparency which is a little odd

considering we don't know who's behind

many of his campaigns and that message

of transparency does seem to

significantly change whenever he's

behind closed doors because here is

audio of Berman pitching his services to

a group of oil executives people always

ask me one question you said how do I

know is that I won't be found out as a

supporter of what you're doing we run

all of this stuff through nonprofit

organization

that are insulated from having to

disclose donors total anonymity see

transparency but look look he is right

there is total anonymity and just as a

general rule if the most common question

you get asked is how do I know no one

will find out on doing business with you

that's not a great sign if the same

privacy guarantee that Hardee's gives

all of its customers don't worry none of

your friends family or coworkers will

ever find out that you've been doing

this now go and enjoy your monster

thickburger before the horse meat gets

cold

but astroturfing is more way more than

just funneling money through nonprofit

front groups groups can also recruit

questionable experts to lend their

arguments credibility there are multiple

examples of this but my favorite

concerns a group called citizens for

fire safety a few years back health

officials in California wanted to remove

a requirement that furniture contained

chemical flame retardants as they had

been linked to cancer but citizens for

fire safety produced a burn surgeon dr.

David heimbach who argued for keeping

all of those flame-retardant

requirements by telling them a pretty

memorable story 7 week old baby was in a

crib laying on a fire-retardant mattress

on a non-fire retardant pillow mom put a

candle in the crib candle fell over the

baby sustained a 50-percent burn the

entire upper half of her body was burned

oh this is a tiny little person no

bigger than my Italian Greyhound at home

she ultimately died after about three

weeks of pain and misery in the hospital

now that sounds horrifying but there are

some weird things about what he just

said first I don't know why he felt the

need to compare the size of a baby to

his Italian Greyhound

everyone knows what size our baby is

nobody's never seen a baby so wait it's

like a person but smaller tell me more

doesn't use stilts how does it board a

bus what I'm picturing is something

about the size of five hamsters taped

together a very small lawnmower a mine

around the right ballpark here but

second if part of you there was

wondering hold on

who puts a candle in their baby's crib

you're not alone journalists with the

Chicago Tribune wondered the exact same

thing and they soon discovered that two

years earlier home back and testified

before a different California panel

telling a weirdly similar story I will

tell you about a child I took care of in

April mom had a candle for sitting at

beside the bed left the room for seven

minutes for reasons we don't know the

child that candle turned over the child

sustained an 80 percent burn okay so now

this is starting to sound a little

suspicious how many people are putting

lit candles in and around their baby's

cribs oh I just put little Ethan to bed

I put plenty of lit candles in his crib

as a nightlight and I balance several

sharp knives and open cancer pain filler

right on the crib wall so he has

something to look at look look home back

wasn't done because just a year later he

was testifying before the state

legislature in Alaska and guess what a

six week old baby that I took care of

earlier this year mother went away there

was a candle on the bureau somehow the

dog knocked the candle onto the crib and

the little girl sustained this seventy

five percent very devastating burn wait

so now there's a dog involved all of a

sudden what kind of dog would do such a

thing wait a second I know exactly what

kind of dog a gruff needlessly Italian

dog like tongue

by God but God as if as if sensing that

lawmakers there were questioning his

motives

the very next centers the home back said

completely unprompted was this I am not

in the pocket of anybody that makes a

specific flame retardant now so be fair

he's actually right about that he was

not in the pocket of someone that made a

specific flame retardant he was however

in the pocket of citizens for fire

safety who paid him $240,000 for his

help and who it turned out only had

three members which were the three

largest makers of flame retardants in

the world so I call it liar liar pants

chemically incapable of catching on fire

oh and what Northey when a reporter

called the medical examiner's office

they had no record of any burn victim

matching heimbach's description

whatsoever so one of them did the next

logical thing i thought the best thing

to do was just to call him at home i

said those kids you talked about did

they all die in your hospital he said it

wasn't factual it was anecdotal and i

said but that's not what you testified

and he said well I wasn't under oath

okay okay

well first of all you're generally

expected to tell the truth even when

you're not under oath and second of all

anecdotes aren't the same as lies I saw

Keri Russell walking out of a bakery

that's an anecdote it's not a good

anecdote but it is an anecdote I saw

Keri Russell riding a dragon out of a

bakery that is a lie although admittedly

would be a way better story and look the

real problem there is home backs lies

worked that flame-retardant bill in

California initially failed thanks in

part to his testimony and and the final

and paps most controversial tool in

astro surfing relates to something that

our current president actually loves to

complain about I'll tell you what you

take a look outside

these are paid protesters folks the

protesters are paid a lot of money by

the DNC it turned out that the

protesters were used to have

we're bought for $1,500 apiece we have a

protester by the way were you paid

$1,500 to be a thug

now I can't walk it quite out there is

Trump angry or is he excited he's just

stumbled onto a job opportunity that

John Julie and Eric would actually be

qualified for but for what Russ specific

accusations were nonsense

hey demonstrators do exist which Trump

should frankly know himself because his

campaign reportedly had actors who were

paid $50 to cheer for him and his

campaign announcement but but paid

demonstrators are one of the most

infuriating tools of astroturfing just

just look at what happened last year in

New Orleans

a company called Entergy needed city

council approval for a controversial

power plant which it got not long after

a public meeting where by sheer chance a

bunch of huge power plant fans in orange

shirts turned up now it later emerged

that a PR firm working for Entergy hired

a company called crowds on demand which

recruited actors to supports in the

plants they did this with a facebook ad

which offered and I quote 60 to $200 e

dues to help with a gig for three hours

which in itself right there is a red

flag dollar e dues sounds like slang for

money that you'd find in a Mark Twain

novel called even for the 1800s there

are way too many n words in this crowd

of demands even provided talking points

such as folks this is 2017 we had a boil

water advisory here last month and I'm

tired of feeling like I live in a third

world country and it seems like some of

the people there took those notes and

ran with them I'm tired of feeling like

we're living in a third world country

this is the United States of America its

2017 going on 2018 and we have to worry

about these frequent water boil

advisories and so on and so forth I have

to be concerned that a grandmother or a

son or a pet could possibly drink or

take in some brain-eating ameba

yeah I'll give him credit for that last

but the brain-eating ameba bit was all

his own he was just riffing hard at that

point now now that man insists that he

believed everything he said and that he

wasn't paid by crowds on demand although

you should know that another person

there who does admit to being paid said

he received instructions that read a few

things to keep in mind one tell nobody

will being paid to tell nobody you're

being paid three media will be present

do not talk to them for tell nobody

you're being paid and five if somebody

approaches you don't tell them you're

being paid which are and this is true

word-for-word the vows in a traditional

Scientology wedding now if you look

they're beautiful vows and you should go

now if you are wondering who is behind

crowds on demand let me introduce you to

their CEO Adam Swart the answer to the

question what if a lukewarm bottle of

smirnoff ice was a person now now he's

he's pretty unrepentant about what his

firm does have you ever provided

protesters for an event of course

demonstrators of course do you see

anything wrong with that personally nope

do you ever feel like you're tricking

people though into getting behind

something that they may have not gotten

behind if they didn't see all this

activity there we don't trick people we

engage them yeah yeah but you engage

them by tricking them don't you both

both of those things can be true at the

same time it's like someone saying I'm

not masturbating in the middle of this

Pinkberry

I'm just engaging the police department

you're actually doing both and one

doesn't make the other okay now of

course what's whole ruse is predicated

on people holding their nerve and not

giving the game away in real time but

amazingly that has happened in the small

town of Camarillo

I think the city needs a shake of

citizens aren't shy about expressing

their opinions but one chilly Wednesday

night in December Prince

Jordan Tyson city officials say this man

stood out this case is clearly common

sense because for three minutes he told

the City Council what he later admits

was a lie I'm just a concerned citizen

coming up here and speaking to you but

he's not he's a self-described

struggling actor from Beverly Hills it

goes by the name of Prince Jordan Tyson

okay no I don't believe it I do not

believe it does anything about this face

this face say struggling actor from

Beverly Hills to you I'm sorry this

story just doesn't check out but

incredibly it's true because while they

know Toya's pjt initially claims to be

from the area he soon had a crisis of

confidence culminating in this forty

minutes later

Tyson came back to the podium Prince is

back for one of the strangest moments

the City Council has ever seen I don't

agree with the reason I'm here and I was

paid to be here how much were you paid

hundred bucks how much $100 you're

idiot Prince you just broke

ground on Tim Barnes rules one two four

and five now you won't get those

hundred-dollar e dues which could have

gone toward changing your name to

literally anything else or getting a

haircut that doesn't make you look like

an out dente Owen Wilson when you add

all of this together faith groups hiring

fake experts and fake crowds which

managed to affect real world change it

gets pretty dispiriting and it can do

real damage that goes way beyond the

narrow issues that each group is trying

to influence the very existence of

companies like crowds on demand mean

that something authentic can now be

tainted in fact conspiracy boards now

regularly and wrongly cite crowds on

demand as providing everything from paid

protesters for Charlottesville to crisis

actors for the Las Vegas shooting and

that is hugely dangerous because the

consequences of this cannot be that

everyone assumes that anyone who doesn't

agree with them is astroturf you know

what while skepticism is healthy

cynicism real cynicism is toxic and

because this problem isn't going it away

going away it is now even more incumbent

on us to use our judgment diligently if

the Ray Liotta of docks is telling us

the Humane Society is terror

it's probably worth us all asking why

why who might have trained him and what

do they stand to gain and unfortunately

until we find out a way to force

astroturf groups to be more transparent

and accountable that's about all we can

do right now astroturf is a serious

threat to our public discourse and it is

critical that we are all much more aware

of its dangers

and since astroturf furs have left all

their tools lying around at the very

least we might as well use them to fight

candle fire with candle fire and deliver

a heartfelt message we're all Americans

real people definitely not actors were

just a coalition of Concerned doctors

mothers teachers and kidnappers and we

think you deserve the truth about

astroturf furs here are the facts

astroturf furs are responsible for every

shark attack in American history wonder

all the B's have gone after jurors shot

him in the face and according to the

bipartisan Institute of factual science

studies every single astroturf fur has

killed at least one puppy with their

bare hands or maybe not we're not under

oath the point is that's what surfers

set this baby on fire that's not a dog

that's a real baby no bigger than an

Italian Greyhound

her name's Eleanor and she likes for

things but binky hood Bava corporate and

political transparency and not being on

fire and right now

Elinor is open for and if you're not

careful one day a pastor is going to

come to your house and like your baby

fire stop and structure they paid for by

citizens for fresh orange juice

you

state attorneys general and yes that is

the correct plural and if you already

knew that I'm sorry that high school was

such a rough time for you believe me I

know being a teenage grammar nerd is

something from which it is difficult to

recover and look I do realize that they

show about state AG's sounds like a

tedious prospect just watch the start of

this 2006 panel discussion on c-span in

front of an electrified crowd our panel

today features three distinguished and

very very different and bipartisan

attorneys general I gotta say that was a

bit of a dick move by the c-span camera

man there he didn't have to pan across

those empty seats but he did it anyway

as if to say look even the panel's

friends didn't show up and I'll tell you

what that panel did wrong actually if

you want a live audience to listen to

you talk about state AG's simply don't

tell them in advance we filmed this show

in front of a live audience

you think we told them what this shows

about of course not they were explicitly

told that this was a taping of the

Rachael Ray Show and I promise she'll be

out any minute now but look it is worth

the effort to learn about state AG's

because they are very important and yet

most of us probably don't know who ours

is although if you live in Indiana I am

very excited to introduce you to yours

please meet Curtis Hill AG by day

although by night something very much

different I was toying around with it

and discovered that I sounded sorta like

Elvis we're caught in a trap I can't

walk out

because I love you too much baby

we saw the Attorney General do all the

hits I don't know if you've noticed but

I don't look much like Elvis to be

honest I'd noticed that frankly it's

difficult to notice anything besides the

most sadistic inseam in the history of

tailoring that looks like a marshmallow

bisected with fishing wire and that's

all it looks like most ladies are

actually elected meaning they belong to

political parties and they run campaign

ads like this striking one from Michigan

when you're choosing Michigan's next

Attorney General ask yourself this who

can you trust most not to show you their

penis in a professional setting is that

the candidate who doesn't have a penis

I'd say so well certainly and arguments

although to be honest if you asking me

which candidate I trust most not to show

me their penis I'd have to go with

dickless Dennis he he can't show me his

penis why that mean old raccoon still

has it that woman is running for

attorney general in Michigan it's one of

30 states where voters will be selecting

their next AG on November 6th and those

elections are going to be unusually

competitive some estimate that more than

a hundred million dollars will be spent

on AG races this year that's up to three

times more than ever before so tonight

let's look at who AG's are what they do

and why they matter and let's start with

what they do because typically they

serve as a state's chief legal officer

and the people's loyal with

responsibilities ranging from a criminal

law enforcement to consumer advocacy to

and everything in between

the landmark multi-billion dollar

tobacco industry settlement in the 90s

the one that killed Joe Camel that was

thanks to state AG's this year's

blockbuster report on abuses by the

Catholic Church in Pennsylvania that was

thanks to a state AG you know who put

out that raging wildfire in Northern

California

that was firefighters use your head why

would state AG's have been involved in

that use your instincts here

the fact is the fact is though AG's

often work on politically neutral

matters and they still do but in recent

decades they've also become

significantly more partisan one small

sign of this is that while all AG's

belong to the National Association of

attorneys general or nag around two

decades ago Republicans formed a

separate committee just for them raga

and the Democrats followed suit with

dagger and I do know that rocket and

dagger sound like twins from Dutch

folklore that teach children about right

and wrong

Rocka always milks the cow when its

udders are swollen but darker is off

making nonsense with a goose

when darker is given no dinner this is

justice but arguably the most

high-profile way in which this job has

become more partisan is the extent to

which a GS belonging to one party have

teamed up to bring lawsuits against the

federal government now that used to be

relatively rare but starting in the

Obama years the number of those sort of

lawsuits skyrocketed

it was Republican AG's who successfully

limited the Medicaid expansion of

Obamacare and suing the government

became a point of pride for AG's like

Texas's Greg Abbott what I do is I go

into the office I sue the federal

government and then I go home

I've sued the Obama administration now

25 times over the last four years yeah

but that is not the smirk of a guy who

just goes into the office sues the

government and goes home is it that's

the smoke of a guy who goes into the

office sues the government adjust the

office thermostat without telling anyone

steal someone's sandwich from the fridge

farts in the elevator and then goes home

now Apple has since gone on to become

governor of Texas but his successor Ken

Paxton was no less eager to sue the

Obama administration just listened to

his wife proudly describing Paxton's

love for lawsuits in what apparently I

legally have to call a song I'm a

pistol-packing mama yes I

I'm a pistol-packing mama

Esaias I'm a pistol-packing mama and my

husband sues Obama again I never thought

I would say this but I would honestly

rather listen to moose knuckle Elvis

Shirley Temple get up in his living room

in a too-tight onesie now

Paxton himself is actually a really good

example of how a state AG's political

views can significantly impact their

work

he told County Clerk's that they could

refuse to issue marriage licenses to

same-sex couples he was a lead plaintiff

in a lawsuit that shot down an Obama era

rule that would have made four million

people eligible for overtime pay and

when the Obama administration tried to

extend protections for transgender kids

in public schools

Paxton sued and said this any man that

decides that they wanted to clear

themselves to be female for the day can

walk into your daughter's locker room or

bathroom it now opens the door for

anybody no matter what they are and how

they're thinking they can change their

gender for a day and have the ability to

walk into a women's locker room it's

just not right what the are you

talking about obvious bigotry aside

transgender people don't just switch

identity for convenience they are human

beings not read frogs that's right read

frogs

should the need arise can spontaneously

change from female to male I just hit

you with an unexpected frog fact in the

middle of talking about state attorneys

general I know what you're thinking

where the is Rachael Ray

in the next village I'm gonna write just

be patient be patient

she'll be here she's making frittatas

and you're all going to have a taste

now should be here just be patient

now now now Paxton has actually spent

almost his entire time in office under

indictment and is awaiting trial for

securities fraud but that is not evenly

ken Paxton related allegation I would

like to show you instead I'd like to

focus on one mentioned in a real attack

ad from his current opponent this is the

collin county courthouse where a dallas

attorney accidentally left a $1,000 pen

at the metal detectors this is Ken

Paxton the indicted Texas Attorney

General rummaging through the metal

detector trays and stealing that $1,000

pen and this is Ken Paxton the indicted

Texas Attorney General walking away with

a stolen pen vote Justin Nelson for

Texas Attorney General he will fight on

behalf of all Texans and he won't steal

no pain yes that's a relief although

thanks to that ad earlier I would also

like to know that he won't steal my pen

or show me his penis or for that matter

shown me his pen or steal my penis I

wouldn't need to know all his positions

on the penis pen show-steal continuum

still the larger point is state AG's are

increasingly partisan and when you look

at how ken Paxton has used his power it

is hard not to think that that is a bad

thing but partisanship can cut both ways

and now that Trump is in office

democratic state AG's are the ones

filing lawsuits against the president

and while you may have been unhappy to

hear people cheer for that

pistol-packing mama as husband suing

Obama I suspect it may feel a little

different hearing the Democratic AG of

Washington state say this we have 19

since the donald trump became president

we've filed 19 lawsuits against

administration so what do you say to

people who just think you have an axe to

grind against this guy why I plead

guilty

[Laughter]

you see it's interesting how your

feelings on soon the government can

change a lot based on who is saying it

it's like how I'm getting off here is a

fine thing for someone to say if they're

standing next to the door of a train but

a very rude thing to say if they are

masturbating on that same train

so look state AG's have a lot of power

and while many of us may not have been

aware of that corporations and other

special interests certainly have because

both rocker and dagger have been

increasingly aggressive about raising

funds and one way they do that is by

organizing events where they essentially

sell access to AG's ragga

especially has some pretty lavish

getaways where industries can mingle

with the AG's who are supposed to be

policing them as CPS found when it spot

on one in South Carolina we saw at least

nine state AG's rubbing shoulders with

representatives from Koch Industries Big

Tobacco payday lenders and the NRA the

dress code resort casual CBS News

reviewed 88 donations over $50,000 and

found more than half of the donors had

matters under consideration by a state

attorney general or had recently settled

now rocker says there is absolutely no

quid pro quo there so I guess those

groups simply donated substantial

amounts of money because they wanted to

chillax to the max at a resort casual

clambake with North Dakota Attorney

General Wayne Stenehjem oh yeah he's not

just the AG of North Dakota he's the

mayor of margarita blue Wayne

parties hard he's an animal

and look some state AG's have been

ridiculously cozy with corporations take

scott pruett former head of the EPA he

previously served as Oklahoma's AG where

he had a very close relationship with

energy companies he sued the EPA 14

times and wrote the agency multiple

letters about policies that threatened

to impact local oil companies like Devon

Energy but when a reporter obtained

copies of Pruitt's correspondence with

Devon he noticed a weird coincidence the

letters that scott pruett had written

were identical copies in most cases of

draft letters that Devon had sent him he

had taken those letters and simply put

him on a stationery and sentiment as if

they were essentially the state law

enforcement official opinion it was like

holy exactly like he said holy



and that sure looks like Pruitt let an

oil company do his work for him although

to be fair maybe he just happened to

think up the exact same words in the

exact same order that they did maybe you

find that plausible personally I find it

about as plausible as I do the idea that

the family in a quiet place stayed

silent for 472 days Wow no one thought

Eid for more than a year that could

really be the title of the movie because

that is genuinely incredible so so state

AG's are powerful increasingly partisan

and over half of them are on the ballot

this year and Republicans are very much

ready for this fight as Arkansas state

AG and chair of raga Leslie Rutledge

will tell you when it comes to the

Democratic AG's I can't speak to what

they do I know they raise a heck of a

lot less money than the Republican AG's

do because we have been crushing it ok

so first again a bit of a dick move by

the c-span Caravan they're undercutting

her claims of crushing it with a cruel

cut away to her audience candy crushing

it but the fact is she is right Raja is

really out raising dark and it seems

they are now locked in an arms race for

funds which just cannot be the

healthiest way for this system to

operate naughty raga naughty dagger if

you keep keep behaving like that your

parents will tell you to de see which

like your sisters

now interestingly Rutledge is one of the

AG's up for election on November 6th as

is possible pen thief Ken Paxton and if

you live in any of these highlighted

States you have got an Ag race to vote

for and it is really worth taking a few

minutes to research the candidates

especially because many people who do

actually vote end up leaving the AG box

on the ballot empty so your vote for Ag

may technically be even more valuable in

Texas one poll showed that 39% of

registered voters didn't name who that

they would vote for for Ag because they

and I quote haven't thought enough about

it which sounds terrible but that's

actually a cause for genuine hope

because remember that is where Ken

Paxton is running and if there is one

thing sure to damage Ken Paxton's

reputation it's an awareness of Ken

Paxton's reputation so so please before

November 6th just think about your AG

race you can do it you've got nine days

left and I know that we've all been

asked to think about a lot this year

from Supreme Court nominations to gun

control to the energy of Pete Davidson's

penis it's it's been a lot and now I am

adding research your state AG race to

your list but it is honestly worth it

also if you do it you'll frankly be

amazed at the kind of tidbits that you

might find if you live in Wisconsin just

google Brad Schimel $10,000 coins and

you'll learn about how your AG managed

to spend ten grand of taxpayer money on

coins reading K AE D which stands for

his actual personal motto kicking ass

every day if you live in Arkansas Google

Leslie Rutledge karaoke 2016 so you can

see our friend from before absolutely

crushing it on stage

[Music]

wait did that guy just say sing it

Leslie I'm not sure that's encouragement

I think that might be an honest plea

sing it Leslie sing it

don't just drone it a rhythmically and

an inconsistent volume the bands in E

major and you're in H try and bring it

into the known musical universe Leslie

and look if you're in Michigan and even

if you are not please google Bill

Schuette e 1989 video here's their

current AG but he's not actually up for

election because he's running for

governor but it is still worth googling

that so you can watch him creepily

hitting on a woman behind the camera I

would be happy to move closer to the

land anything some things that may not

let you run the camera on admire your

tenacity appreciate your spirit of

Vincent van Gogh Rembrandt Toulouse

Lautrec oh that is rough to watch I

don't know how she got through the

interview without punching him in the

dick

but point here is a point here is taking

just two minutes to research your state

AG is a valuable use of your time and if

you are thinking that you don't have two

minutes you actually do because it's

11:28 right now I'm not saying goodbye

until 11:30 so go to vote for one one

org right now where you can find out if

there is an election in your state and

if so who your AG candidates are

seriously do it now you will not be

missing anything

I promise nothing entertaining is going

to happen for the rest of this show in

fact to help drive you away for the rest

of the broadcast a bagpiper will be

playing Leslie Rutledge's favorite song

she thinks my tractor's sexy take it

away

[Music]

yes

believe it or not these bagpipes make

this song even more unlistenable than it

already is

that is an ungodly noise no disrespect

turn this show off now and research your

AG and if you haven't already been

repelled into action I'll happily add an

accordion into the mix oh yes the sweet

sweet sound of a bagpipe are called into

x2 sounds that come together

what pop-tarts and fish gum two bunks

for what one.org

right now because I promise this just

isn't gonna get any better and don't

push me on this mentally sound

think again don't join me

should be watching this show anymore

[Music]

coming tonight

[Applause]

that we're never going to pay for

charters

[Applause]

how are you somehow the worst

ingredients in all this

energies because these guys are bout to

get louder

[Music]

Public Defenders the only people who

appear in court more frequently than

former child stars even if you have

never come into contact with the public

defender you will know them from their

important cameo in the Miranda warning

speech you have the right to remain

silent you have the right to an attorney

give the right to an attorney give the

right to an attorney you have the right

to an attorney you have the right to an

attorney yes apparently even Garfield

knows he has the right to a public

defender and he's going to need one too

because he just murdered a lasagna and a

person the right to a lawyer is a pillar

of American jurisprudence but it's a

right that we've only had since 1963

when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled

that any person who is too poor to hire

a lawyer cannot be assured a fair trial

unless a lawyer is provided for him it's

an idea so obvious you can't believe

there was ever a time that we didn't

have it like corn on the cob holders

that are shaped like corn on the cobs no

one should ever have had to come up with

those they're essential to the fabric of

American life the problem is our public

defender system is currently massively

overburdened depending on the

jurisdiction anywhere from 60 to 90

percent of criminal defendants need a

publicly funded attorney and the system

is creaking under that weight right now

there are about 20 public defenders

handling up to 250 cases in New Orleans

for example each public defender handles

roughly 350 cases a year

public defenders in Fresno County often

work on a thousand cases a year when

state guidelines say they shouldn't be

doing more than a hundred and fifty

thousand cases in a year that's nearly

three cases per day those are Gerard

Depardieu wine consumption numbers

at breakfast and and with caseloads that

heavy public defenders cannot possibly

prepare an effective defense a study New

Orleans a few years back found that the

city had some part-time defenders who

could only spend an average of seven

minutes per case and that is not long

enough to prepare anything

if I only had seven minutes to prepare

this show I definitely would not be

talking about public defenders right now

I'd be desperately trying to fill time

by listing the Muppets in order of

ability I'll do it now Fozzie first

obviously obviously you go fuzzy first

most attractive thing is a sense of

humor don't you gotta go Ralph

you've got to go role then you know what

I'm going Swedish chef and I'm finishing

up with Sam the Eagle because you know

he's into some freaky business this is

just the beginning of the problems some

places don't even have a public

defender's office and and some counties

just contract cases out in bulk to the

lowest bidder and at its worst this can

result in a system known as meetin and

pleadin where the vast majority of

defendants plead out and never even go

to trial 90 to 95 percent of all

criminal cases state and federal are

resolved by plea bargaining now just

think about that about 95 percent of

criminal cases never make it to trial if

law and order reflected reality their

episodes would be pretty short it

basically just be how does your client

plead guilty your honor and then this

[Music]

and as a viewer you would justifiably

feel cheated by that and look it is easy

not to care about this it's easy to

assume that if someone is being

represented by a public defender

they're probably guilty but many are not

and some only please because they feel

they have no alternative look at her

face Stewart

she was arrested in a drug sweep but

claimed she was innocent she faced a

10-year sentence and was stuck in jail

because she couldn't afford bail

she said her court-appointed lawyer

urged her to take a plea deal and she

will ultimately agreed please will fire

your probation you know just just let me

go home to my kid she admitted to a

crime she denies committing just to

spend time with her children that is

horrifying especially because I would be

willing to commit a crime just to not

have to spend time with any children

they are loud cesspools of bacteria with

nothing interesting to say oh you want

to grow up and be a princess I'll tell

you what happens to princesses actually

google diana + truth do it doo doo Biltz

google it actually now after omer pled

guilty the prosecution's case collapsed

and the other defendants who didn't take

a plea deal had their charges dropped

but oma could not take her plea back so

she had to spend five years on probation

during which she was ineligible for some

form of public assistance and wound up

homeless and that is the problem with a

system that can a lot as little as seven

minutes to helping people make decisions

that can affect you for the rest of your

life our public defender system is

dangerously under-resourced one report

found out that 40% of all county based

public defenders have no investigators

on staff that's 40 percent of lawyers

forced to sit at their desks googling

where to get exonerating evidence and

hitting on feeling lucky

and the offices those desks are in could

potentially lack basic standards of

workplace health and safety tough to do

your job when you're competing with

countless roaches crawling around your

office but that is the work environment

and ordered by employees at Augustus

public defender's office and it's so bad

that the office had to close early today

and this infestation is nothing new

oh it's been going on for four years

that office is getting to a point where

roaches are outnumbering than lawyers

and unless one of those roaches happens

to have a law degree from the University

of Rochester and can help take on some

clients that's going to be a problem as

for New Orleans their public defender's

office has actually put up a

crowdfunding page to help make up their

budget shortfall and it's currently only

raised 19 percent of its goal and look

nobody should be in jail because a

Kickstarter didn't meet its goal if

anything some people should be in jail

because a Kickstarter did reach its goal

like this one for an actual giant

inflatable Lionel Richie head YouTube

gentleman should be locked up all night

long all night all night but despite all

these enormous challenges there are

still some amazing lawyers like Travis

Williams he frames every acquittal and

puts it on his wall but guess where he

puts his losses I'm gonna get the last

name of every case I've lost tattooed on

my back right now it's only five and

hopefully it won't get hopefully I want

to feel my back though that's to go but

since the lot since Elena's going to

wall I decided the losses have to go

somewhere they're going my back but they

don't give me felt he tattoos the names

of the cases he's lost on his back that

is a truly heroic lawyer he's like

Atticus Finch only real and not as it

turns out a horrible racist

screw you Fucci Gulf come knockin Birds

the point is many public defenders do

heroic work despite facing overwhelming

institutional obstacles including this

incredible incident involving a Florida

judge not pissing me off

just sit down I'll take care of I don't

need your help right to be here if you

want to fight let's go out back and I'll

just look around

that is clearly a disgrace although I

will say folks like that would make jury

duty a lot more interesting Your Honor

we have reached a verdict we find the

proceedings to be fling awesome

incidentally that judge returned to the

courtroom and called seven cases without

the public defender being present and

he's still on the bench and look a bad

judge can come and go as the head of

programming at NBC will tell you but

access to a lawyer is supposed to be a

constitutional right and it is

increasingly under threat

for instance in four states you can make

so little that you qualify for food

stamps but still not be poor enough to

get state-funded representation and in

at least 43 states you can be billed for

a public defender meaning in these

states we have a system where

conceivably you if you cannot afford an

attorney one will be provided for you

provided that you pay that attorney

which is absurd you can't tell people

something's free and then charge them

for it this is the American judicial

system not candy crush and and for what

this can look like on a human level meet

Larry Thompson in 2010 he was arrested

in Florida for driving with a revoked

license which was a felony charge

because he'd had multiple driving

violations before Larry was sent to jail

where he applied for a public defender

which in Florida incredibly requires a

fifty dollar application fee he couldn't

afford to pay that or his bail so he was

stuck in jail for 59 days at which point

he gave up and pled no contest to get

out and was released on time served but

in Florida if you use a public defender

and have found guilty even by plea you

then Oh attorneys fees and costs

regardless of your ability to pay so

Larry now old not just the $50 public

defender application fee but also an

extra $100 fee for having used the

public defender and even another fee of

$100 to pay the prosecution's costs

which is like taking like a bully taking

your lunch money and then charging you

an additional lunch money reallocation

fee but they still weren't done on top

of those and other fees for the cry

pled no contest to the court then added

partial payment fees each month for the

next several months

bringing Larry's tab to six hundred and

seventy five dollars and that all brings

us to about a month ago when Larry was

actually arrested for contempt of court

as a result of not paying those fees and

arrests incidentally for which they

charged him a two hundred and ten dollar

administrative fee at this point they

may they may as well have just slapped

on an irony fee for good measure because

it turns out having no money in Florida

can be really expensive or one

more thing when they arrested Larry he

was receiving hospice care for a

terminal pulmonary condition and was so

ill that gel was forced to send him to

the hospital where he was watched by two

guards and chained by his ankles to his

hospital bed luckily he was eventually

released and his debt was paid by donors

who heard his story but he still

understandably could not quite believe

what had just happened to him I never

knew they would actually arrest the

person in my condition well not being

able to claim money because I have a

favorite so I can't see them I keep

arresting the old man over to take me

back to jail it charge me 250 more

dollars that I have to agree to I guess

I'm sitting in jail when I can't get

oxygen in jail like I needed so they dig

me actually an issue in me a distance

none of things makes any sense

it doesn't even make fiscal sense

because the state of Florida did collect

the eight hundred eighty five dollars in

fines that Larry owed them but in doing

that they spent thousands of dollars

needlessly imprisoning him and surely

Florida could have used that money for

something they badly needs like I don't

know rehab programs for meth-addicted

swamp raccoons

I'm assuming accurately but but the

point is 50 years after the Supreme

Court gave everyone the fundamental

right to an attorney even if you can't

afford one we now have a system where

the most vulnerable people are

potentially being charged for access to

a hideously broken system and we either

need to fix that or at the very least

update the Miranda warning in our cop

shows to reflect reality

you have the right to remain silent the

right to remain silent you have the

right to remain silent anything you say

can and will be used against you in a

court of law

you're the light you're an attorney

you're gonna afford an attorney one will

be provided for you I did it alright

we're not done I'm not done I'm not

finished that attorney may have 300

other cases that he or she is working on

that's not a joke literally 300 other

cases potentially have a total of seven

minutes to prepare your defense do i

short seven minutes is no short seven

minutes it Billy Joel's scenes from an

Italian restaurant is 37 seconds longer

and that attorney that attorney that

attorney may be exhausted unable to

think straight the attorney is likely to

be grossly underpaid or working in an

office crawling with cockroaches you

know what really blows that attorney may

pressure you to take a guilty plea

statistically statistically

statistically there's a 90 plus percent

chance that you will take that guilty

plea an attorney may get challenged to a

fight in the hallway by a judge that

guess where I don't know yes

come on guess Florida of course it was

Florida how could it not be fun one more

thing that attorney that is provided for

you may not be free if you lose you may

have to pay them you might even have to

pay the prosecutor is that

constitutional its constitutional as

you piece of

and all this assumes that we can even

pay for that lawyer how's the

Kickstarter campaign doing now do you

understand your rights as I have

explained them to you know what no

basically

you

you

[Music]

voting for adults one of the few

remaining activities for it you still

get a sticker the midterm elections are

just two months away when every citizen

of voting age will have their chance to

be heard even this guy thing is the

category and when you're ready Edgar

fish love this law sorry Edgar but the

category was things are the answer we

were looking for was fish loop it's it's

the thing you use when you want to

a fish facially but a lot next time

Edgar the fact is while that fish pucker

may be able to cast the votes a

surprisingly large amount of people are

barred from doing so it's estimated that

more than six million Americans are

barred from voting because of felony

disenfranchisement laws it's true six

million people are unable to vote

because at some point in their life they

committed a felony that is a lot for

perspective that's like if you took all

the people who bought a copy of Robin

Thicke's divorce opera Paula and then

added almost six million more people

look if any of you are thinking this

point well who really gives a if

convicted felons can't vote you frankly

wouldn't be alone they've committed

crimes are they the best people to judge

some of these laws that are to be passed

would we rather live in a society where

there are no consequences for our

actions I just think that they've done

something wrong so I don't really think

they should be allowed to be voting in

our president and stuff like that oh oh

you don't do you you think if someone

makes a mistake you should follow them

for the rest of their life whether they

were convicted of marijuana possession

or went to brunch dressed like a TJ Maxx

Janis Joplin I get it I get it the fact

here is many lawmakers actually agree

with her here is Mitch McConnell arguing

that keeping felons from voting is a

public safety issue we're talking about

rapists murderers and robbers and even

terrorists or spies do we want to see

convicted terrorists who seek to destroy

this country voting in elections

okay first terrorists are not voting are

they they're all about making giant

violent points that get everyone's

attention not lining up in a public

school gymnasium to write in Isis for

this

school boards and second the most recent

analysis found only 18% of felony

convictions were for violent crimes of

any sort meaning the vast majority were

for nonviolent offenses like property or

drug crimes and for those who have

served their sentence but are still

unable to vote this situation is

understandably frustrating at what point

do we break the cycle at what point are

we able to say hey you know what

I am citizen enough you want me to work

you want me to pay taxes you want me to

make sure I take care of my family but

yeah I can't vote so am i citizen or am

I not a citizen yeah he's got a point

because that man is suffering taxation

without representation and historically

that's been a bit of a sticking point

for America I'm pretty sure I learned

about that in school something about the

American savages through tea into the

water without even having the common

decency to add a splash of milk so so

tonight so tonight let's look at felony

disenfranchisement and one state in

particular because these six million

disenfranchised voters are not evilly

distributed around the country in most

states people with felony convictions

automatically regain their voting rights

at some point but there are a few where

they do not and the worst state of all

concerning this and arguably everything

else is Florida around one and a half

million of its citizens nearly 10% of

its adult population have completed

sentences for felony convictions but

still can't vote and given the

iniquities of our justice system that

burden is disproportionately felt by

african-americans because in Florida

over one in five black adults cannot

vote that is staggering it may be the

dumbest thing about Florida which is

frankly impressive considering stories

like these only in Florida would an

underwear clad man go for a walk in the

rain with his pet goat also if you could

tell there he's um he's playing a

harmonica check out this video showing a

genius steering his motorcycle with his

feet in Jacksonville only in Florida

does a creature this adorable become a

bloodthirsty fur demon all of a sudden

he jumped on the kayak in two seconds

later he jumped on me the viral video

shows Robbie Stratton running through a

convenience store with an alligator in

his hands no wreck

action of that happening at all at all

this store sells a good liquor okay

everything about that guy is absolutely

fascinating but I think I'm most

interested to the fact that he was drunk

at the store where he bought the liquor

so did he buy the liquor leave drinking

fetch an alligator and then returned to

the same store did he drink the liquor

at the store at which point an alligator

walked in or did he get drunk and then

meet a sober alligator was having a bad

day once it have a couple of drinks and

the guy said I know just the place

alligator I don't know the point is it's

Florida all options are equally

plausible here's the thing the fact is

Florida is the disenfranchisement

capital of America so how did that

happen well for starters a post-civil

war changed their constitution stripped

all convicted felons of their voting

rights for life

and while Florida's governor can restore

those rights the current one Rick Scott

seen here auditioning for the role of

happy pencil in all my nightmares he has

made this process much more difficult

because what the governor before him

made regaining voting rights close to

automatic for many nonviolent offenses

Scott implemented a system where you

have to wait five to seven years just to

apply to get your vote back then submit

an application then wait more then in

many cases have to travel to Tallahassee

which no one should ever have to do

under any circumstances to argue your

case in person these obstacles are

ridiculous and unnecessary and this is

how Scott justified them look if you if

you are a convicted felon and part of

what you did you lost your rights and so

you ought to you know there ought to be

a process if you're gonna get those

rights back and I think it's fair to the

rest of the citizens of the state and

it's they'll see a process that they

didn't they know will work right except

there is a process for paying your debt

to society and getting your rights back

it's called

serving your sentence you're

just tagging on at the end it's

like someone finishing a triathlon and

we can start to then say no it's a

quarter con now you have to learn manual

it doesn't really seem fair and and it's

honestly worth taking a look at this

process because it's absolutely insane

applications are judged by a clemency

board made up of Rick Scott and members

of his cabinet seen here looking like

the only local news team that you

somehow know aren't each other

and and if you do end up in front of me

you're given ten minutes to prove that

you have turned your life around

they then question you before making a

decision that seems completely arbitrary

and it seems that way because it is

Scott begins meetings by making that pre

fully clear this is a board of clemency

okay we there's no law we're following

the law are been followed by the judges

so we get to make our decisions based on

our own beliefs there's no standards

each of us have the right opportunity

make a decision the way based on what we

believe this is this is a court of mercy

it's not a court in this if there's no

when if you walk up and say I deserve

something that's not how this works

we this there's no there's absolutely no

standards so we can make any decisions

we want you know I'm sure that's true

it's just weird to hear it set out loud

in the same way that would be weird to

give the CEO of Kraft say we don't

actually know what Velveeta is it fell

from space in the 1950s and it's been

spawning in a lab ever since before we

package it we take out the teeth and ice

but we're starting to think it might

make it angry and look because there are

no formal standards the committee can

decide what's important and can focus on

things as petty as moving violations

what we're trying to figure out is is

that have people change their lives

right right that's so so getting traffic

tickets all the time so if you sit up

here your first reaction as well do they

really respect the law right right I

mean that might be your first reaction

to be honest my first reaction is why

rick scott's glass is not near the eyes

part of his head and how have they not

fallen off his nose by now

it is not just your driving record under

scrutiny your personal life is very much

on the table and one board member

Florida CFO Jimmy Patronus seems to have

a specific idea of where that personal

life should be conducted because there

is one question that he asks a lot y'all

go to church you go to church you go to

church together

ma'am where do y'all go to church go

Church and go to church do you go to

church now if the answer to that

question is important that is up

and if it's not why are you constantly

asking it either you are factoring

religious habit into your evaluation of

whether someone should be able to vote

or you're making a list of people's

houses that would be easy to rob on a

Sunday morning and neither is a good use

of the panel's time and once you've

jumped through all of these hoops your

fate is in the hands of a panel who do

not have to explain their reasoning to

you just watch Leon Gillis he had served

time for robbery and drug convictions

but had been clean for eight years and

was running a drug rehab program when he

made his case to the board in 2011 Rick

Scott actually commended him for the

progress that he'd made and then said

this so at this point I'm gonna deny in

restoration of civil rights and can I

answer your question yes sir

how long is there I'm not sure and you

know I think every key every case is

different if I'm doing everything I'm

supposed to do and I'm trying and I'm

making sure that I do the right thing

I'm supposed to do then how long am I

supposed to wait I can tell you that in

that answer but if today and not I don't

feel comfortable doing it okay thank you

and that was it he refused to restore

someone's civil rights without

demonstrating much more of a reason than

I don't know I guess I'm just not

feeling it right now and the thing is

even if this process was perfect which

it is not it can't handle the volume

that the panel only makes meets four

times a year and there are too many

cases for them to review also while

Scott's predecessor restored the Voting

Rights of over one hundred and fifty

five thousand people in his four-year

term Scott is only averaging around 400

a year and that is meaningful especially

in a state where elections tend to have

very narrow margins Trump only won

Florida by a hundred thousand

folks and President Bush famously won it

by just 537 but there are actually

there's actually some genuinely good

news here Florida has a chance to fix

this a real chance there was a

constitutional amendment on their ballot

this November

that would bring Florida in line with

many other states if it passes people

with felony convictions except in the

cases of murder or sex crimes would get

the right to vote after completing their

sentence that could give as many as 1.4

million people the right to vote but it

is by no means a foregone conclusion the

amendment needs a 60% majority to pass

so if it's okay with everybody I would

like to speak directly to the people of

Florida for a second

hi there Florida let's let's try to get

comfortable with each other shall we

I know that we make I know that we make

fun fun of you a lot Florida because of

all the stupid things that happen where

you live and you'll probably expected me

to steer away from all that and appeal

to your innate goodness and sense of

reason but I'm not going to do that

instead

I'd like to Double Down and suggest that

it's precisely because of all that

glorious stupidity that you should

innately appreciate the value of second

chances I mean come on Florida your

Florida a state that's seen the

headlines Florida restaurant no longer

allows monkey Mondays after animal bit

eight-year-old boy and Florida besties

allottee law does not ban oral sex with

animals and Florida gas station dropped

suspect appeared to have drawn on beards

which I would say is probably true given

that this was the beard and yes yes

Floridians you do make mistakes but it's

also in your nature to help one another

recover as you can tell from the

headline Good Samaritan helps Florida

man who accidentally shot himself in the

penis you can't throw for each other

even this song your state song speaks to

your ability to screw up and bounce back

the original lyrics did this have to be

changed because they were too racist and

somehow it still sounds racist today

even in instrumental form the point here

is there's November Florida you have got

a real chance to remedy a mistake and do

something genuinely good for over a

million of your citizens so please on

November 6th for one day just one day

don't take your goat for a walk in your

underwear stay away from any bitey

otters draw a fake beard on yourself and

go cast a vote on behalf of all your

fellow Floridians who are unable to

please do it Cheers Florida Cheers

[Music]

you

you

tonight this entire show is basically

going to be one long recap of one very

long week and and one event in

particular meaning that sadly there's

going to be no time to talk about Trump

insisting that the UN was laughing with

him at him which it absolutely wasn't

nor is that going to be time to tell me

- what was clearly the most fun story of

the week this well the Philadelphia

Flyers having a mascot fans are saying

what that's 7-foot talk ready

Brittany unveiled today in front of

group of kids probably scarred for life

yeah yeah those kids should be scarred

for life

gritty is horrific every single

photo of him is appalling I mean look at

this one that is a nightmare how about

this one

that is simply psychotic Griff he looks

like the end result of the orange

McDonald's fry guy hooking up with

grimace and we've been over this a

million times before on this show if

you're a McDonald's mascot you do not

have sex with another McDonald's mascot

new genetics are too similar and their

kids always turn out winners

very very weird incidentally it's not

like gritty has any business being a

hockey mascot apparently he hasn't

really figured out the navigate on the

ice yet he felled multiple times in his

debut last night the Pittsburgh Penguins

tweeting lol okay - which really

responded sleep with one eye open

tonight bird

holy gritty calm down they're just

engaging in some inter team banter and

you've gone straight to I will murder

you in your sleep

and look there is absolutely nothing

that I would love to do more tonight

than then talk about gritty all night

long from the fact that he's already

done a Kim Kardashian style photo shoot

to the fact that and this is true

someone has already got an actual tattoo

of him on their body interestingly that

someone Jimmy Carter

unfortunately though the fun we just had

must now stop because instead we need to

talk about Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court

nominee and walking crushed be occur on

Thursday

Christine glossy Ford who was a cute

governor of sexually assaulting her in

1982 came before the Senate Judiciary

Committee to deliver some powerful

testimony I am here today not because I

want to be I am terrified I am here

because I believe it is my civic duty to

tell you what happened to me

while Brett Cavanaugh and I were in high

school right and she did just that

describing in deep detail her

recollection of how a drunk Kavanagh

pinned her down tried to remove her

clothing and put his hand over her mouth

which he tried to scream she insisted

that this could not possibly be a case

of mistaken identity

because she was a hundred percent

certain that it was him and after her

opening statement

she don't took questions which sometimes

took an odd turn like when the

prosecutor to whom the Republicans had

outsourced their responsibilities seized

on a polygraph test that Ford had passed

did you pay for the polygraph yourself I

don't think so

okay do you know who did pay for the

polygraph not yet no I believe you said

it hasn't been paid for yet is that

correct

let me put an end to this mystery her

lawyers have paid for her polygraph

as his routine as his routine don't you

try and brush her question aside she

just cracked this case wide open

she found the missing piece of the

puzzle specifically a puzzle that reads

who cares thoughts testimony was

brave and compelling and seemed to

affect many on the committee including

Republican senator Orrin Hatch who chose

to express his admiration in a far from

ideal way and he found dr. Ford credible

pleasing you should not use the word

pleasing to describe a sexual assault

survivor painfully recounting one of the

worst moments of her life you honestly

shouldn't really use it to describe

anything maybe maybe watching milk mix

into your coffee except you know what

not even then because the moment you say

watching this milk is pleasing you come

off like a creep who's waiting for

everyone to leave the room so he can

his coffee the point is by

lunchtime on Thursday it honestly seemed

that Cavanaugh's nomination could be

finished even Fox News was implying as

much this was extremely emotional

extremely raw and extremely credible and

nobody could listen to her deliver those

words and talk about the assault and the

impact it had had on his life in her

life and not have the her heart go your

heart go out to her this is a disaster

for the Republicans that is Fox News

calling Ford's testimony a disaster for

the Republicans and not like one of

those Puerto Rico disasters you know

this time one they might actually care

about but then

then came Cavanaugh testimony and it is

worth looking at it in detail tonight

because in every regard it could not

have been more different from fours a

for starters while she was remarkably

composed in discussing traumatic details

Cavanaugh came straight out of the gates

weird in his opening statement not just

denying all her allegations but almost

breaking down while attempting to paint

a folksy image of his time in high

school I worked out with other guys at

Toby's house he was the great

quarterback on our football team and his

dad ran workouts yeah he's crying at the

memory of lifting weights at his friend

Tobin's house I hate to say it but I'm

starting to think that men might be too

emotional for the super alien corpse

he'd be really pretty if he just smiled

more and it wasn't just memories of a

high school quarterback that was making

him tear up I've always had a lot of

close female friends I remember talking

almost every night it seemed to my

friends ami or Julie or Kristen for

Karen the Suzanne or Maura or Megan or

Nikki the list goes on okay

that's not testimony though is it that

is a plaintive spoken word cover of

Mambo number five

ramallah sandra and rita and as i

continue you know they're getting

sweeter but when Cavanaugh was not

choking back to use he was starting to

get noticeably angry arguing that he was

the victim of a giant conspiracy this

allegation was Unleashed and publicly

deployed over dr. Ford's wishes and then

and then as no doubt was expected if not

planned came a long series of false

last-minute smears designed to scare me

and drive me out of the process before

any hearing occurred crazy stuff gangs

illegitimate children fights on boats in

Rhode Island I mean come on do I seem

like exactly the type of person who

would get into a fight on a boat in

Rhode Island

seriously you tell me when you picture a

fight on a boat in Rhode Island

do you just picture two of me yelling at

each other and exactly this pitch and

volume is that what you say but if you

wanted my hair cut you would tell your

father to give you the fight on a boat

in Rhode Island I would like to see you

say that to my face on a boat in Rhode

Island and that's all I have to shout

about that you

[Applause]

remember what you've just seen was him

reading from a prepared statement it got

even stranger once he started taking

questions did you consume alcohol during

your high school years yes we drank beer

my friends and I the boys and girls yes

we drank the air

I liked beer still liked beer we drank

beer the drinking age as I know it was

18 so the seniors were legal senior year

in high school people were illegal to

drink and we drink yeah we drank beer

and I said sometimes sometimes probably

had too many beers and sometimes other

people had too many beers

we drank beer we liked beer yeah I get

that I do I am I get that loud and clear

Bret's but but the question isn't really

do you like beer is it it's how much do

you like it just like how the question

in Jeffrey Dahmer's trial wasn't do you

like people it was do you like people to

a really problematic extent and when

pressed on his drinking Kavanagh became

either dismissive or outright hostile

and it was at those moments you got a

real sense of who this man actually is

what do you consider to be too many

beers I don't know

you know we whatever the chart says I

like beer I don't know if you like beer

senator um what do you like the next one

is Senator what are you oh you're saying

there's never been a case where you

drank so much that you didn't remember

what happened the night before or part

of what happened that's you're asking

about yeah blackout I don't know have

you

could you answer the question judge I

just so you that's not happened is that

your answer

yeah and I'm curious if you have okay so

first aside from being deeply

disrespectful have you is just dot the

answer of an innocent person if you ask

someone if they ever blew a dog and they

go I don't know of you that person blew

a dog he blew a dog in in all

likelihood not just one either and that

surly tone was emblematic of Cavanaugh's

demeanor throughout the hearing not the

tone of a man who hopes to one day have

the honor of serving on the Supreme

Court but the tone of someone who feels

entitled to be honest and frankly can't

believe that you're being such a dick

about this and that actually does make

some sense because this is a man who has

had every imaginable advantage his elite

high school and this is true has its own

nine hole golf course now am i saying

that someone who went to a school with

its own golf course should not be on the

Supreme Court yeah yeah I think I am but

here we are I'm gonna stand by it but

the catalogue didn't just rely on

belligerence to refute Ford's charges he

brought evidence specifically a calendar

from 1982

about which he was and I know this will

shock you weirdly emotional why did I

keep calendars my dad started to keeping

detailed calendars of his life in 1978

he did so is both a calendar and a diary

Christmastime we sit around and he ails

us with old stories old milestones or

weddings old events from his calendars I

know that it may seem cruel to make fun

of a man crying over his late father's

calendars but what if I were to tell you

that his father is still alive

and was sitting right behind him and

that is why I am now completely

comfortable saying that every Christmas

we'd gather round and dad would

regardless with old events from his

calendar is the single weirdest

thing I've ever heard anybody say

Cavanaugh Jeb said his dad started

keeping calendars in 1978 when Cavanaugh

was 13 meaning he would have been 14 at

the time his dad had even a single

calendar to read to his children fraud

and an adult man reading last year's

calendar to his 14 year old son is

literally the saddest Christmas I could

imagine other than being one of the

innocent people who gets murdered in the

movie die heart that is literally the

only other example and the truth is

Cavanaugh's calendar may not have

actually helped him because while he

told the panel he never attended a

gathering like the one dr. Ford

describes in her allegation in fact his

calendar shows at least one similar

events with at least two of the people

Ford named in her letter and Cavanaugh

misrepresenting the truth actually

became something of a really troubling

pattern for instance he repeatedly made

this strong claim to poke holes in Ford

story I just want to emphasize all four

witnesses who are allegedly at the event

have said it didn't happen including dr.

Ford's longtime friend miss Kaiser

except this 53 year old frat pledge is

actually significantly mistaking the

facts there because in reality three of

those people merely said that they

didn't recall the party as described and

Ford's friend miss Kaiser did

specifically say she believes Ford's

allegation and the fourth person there

is Cavanaugh himself so Cavanaugh just

wildly mischaracterized evidence and

that is one thing a judge really

no not to do is basically that and don't

tuck your robes into your blue jeans

because it's objectively a bad look then

there no was the fact that for all of

cabin last talk of his wholesome teenage

years spent respecting women for their

friendships and doing sick reps and

Tobin's dad's house his high school

yearbook tells a very different story

for instance he and his bro friends brag

about be Renata alumni referring to a

girl that they knew now Kavanagh claims

that that was completely asexual and

just clumsily intended to show affection

and that this she was one of us which is

a little hard to believe given that a

Renata only just found out about it and

said the insinuation is horrible hurtful

and simply untrue and P if it was just

affection for a friend where's the

Alumni Society for Amy or Julie or

Kristen or Karen or more especially

[Applause]

Cavanaugh had similarly implausible

explanations for other terms in the

yearbook specifically those commonly

associated with drinking or sex have you

I don't know if it's buffed or boofed

how do you pronounce that Jai refers to

flatulence we were 16 let's look at

beach week

Ralph's Club biggest contributor what

does the word Ralph mean in that that

probably refers to throwing up I'm known

to have a weak stomach and I always have

devil's triangle drinking game

the term devil's triangle is commonly

known to refer to a threesome involving

two men and one woman so I'm just not

buying that unless all your drinking

games were named after widely recognized

sex acts Oh doggy style drinking game

you pour vodka in a bowl and you lap it

up while wearing only a dog collar a

fist thing drinking game that's gripping

a Shiraz in each fist and toasting the

progress of feminism

sixty-nining absolutely drinking game

that's listening to Bryan Adams hit song

summer of 69 while uneventfully drinking

a beer on the porch even c-span callers

we're not buying this whole drinking

game defense

go ahead Carl hi I just wanted to echo a

few things that another color said which

is that a devil's triangle is certainly

not a drinking game it's an encounter

with two men and a woman bloody well go

next to Mary in Bronxville New York I

like to imagine that that guy calls in

every day to describe what a Devil's

Triangle is and that was the only day he

stood even a chance of getting all the

way through his explanation well it may

seem unbelievably petty to give this

much attention to our high schoolers

yearbook you have to remember that to

some extent many were watching this

hearing to try and ascertain who was

more trustworthy was it the terrified

psychology professor who blew up her

entire life to relive her trauma on a

national stage or was it

Judge animal house who seemed to be

sweating making up drinking games before

members of the Senate and yet for some

senators cavernous poor performance was

completely immaterial as they had

already made up their mind Orrin Hatch

taking a break from being pleased made

the broad case that it was ridiculous to

even ask questions about an events that

took place such a long time ago

this is a national disgrace the way

you're being treated

there's been no whisper of misconduct by

him at a time he's been a judge what we

have are uncorroborated unsubstantiated

claims from his teenage years now that

is clearly a shitty disingenuous

argument though although I will give

hatch credit for invoking the phrase

teenage years with the voice of a

thirteen-year-old whose balls are

literally dropping mid-sentence now as

for Lindsey Graham he turned his

performative disgust at the process up

to 10 this is the most unethical sham

since I've been in politics and if you

really wanted to know the truth you sure

as hell wouldn't have done what you've

done to this guy

you're looking for a fair process you

came to the wrong town at the wrong time

my friend okay first of all Lindsey

Graham sounds like the least

intimidating sheriff in the entire Wild

West you turned back around and get back

on your horse mr. meyen is what you're

looking at is the soft tender little

baby face of justice you came to the

wrong town at the wrong get on your

horse look second Lindsey Graham is not

actually wrong there he looks like a dog

that's not allowed to be within 50 feet

of a playground but he is not

technically wrong this process was

deeply flawed but that is because he and

the Republican majority designed it that

way if they wanted to avoid a he-said

she-said situation they absolutely could

have but it said they only called two

people so we only heard what he said and

what she said a much fairer process

would have involved gathering evidence

and hearing from others like Cavanaugh's

classmates in particular his high school

friend mark judge who forged says was in

the room during the alleged assault but

that is not how Republicans chose to set

up the hearing and fall Cavanaugh's

emotional appeals about wanting his name

cleared he was repeatedly asked about

whether he supported an FBI

investigation and he consistently dodged

the question judge Cavanaugh will you

support an FBI investigation right now I

I will do whatever the committee wants

to personally do you think that's the

best thing for us to do you won't answer

look senator I've said I wanted a

hearing and I'd said I was welcome

anything you'll welcome

anything just say you will support an

investigation you've been accused of a

heinous crime that you insist you did

not commit if I will Cavanaugh I would

be desperately trying to prove my

innocence in every possible way FBI

investigations polygraph tests sworn

affidavits from not only mark judge but

also all my other boys from g-town prep

I'm talking about Tobin Timmy squee PJ

come rug Chuck smirk see dubs dirty Pete

fat Andy Swift of the horndog bow

nowit's boner which his older brother

Jay money and dick you know you

know character witnesses look at this

point let's actually pull back and look

at the picture of Cavanaugh's character

that we now have because even if you

don't think he's guilty of sexual

assault or even if you think that it's

impossible to say whether he is because

it happened in his teenage years even

then there should be plenty in what we

saw this week - cause you real concern

because a key part of the job that he is

up for is judgment and temperament and

this week we saw Cavanaugh talk over the

top of Senators dodged questions and

conflate doesn't recall something

happening with denies something happened

which is again a important

distinction for a judge not to mention

he repeatedly wept at the concept of

calendars and there was one more

important moment that I would argue is

disqualifying in and of itself because

ideally a Supreme Court justice should

make decisions independent of politics

Cavanaugh himself has stated the court

must never be viewed as a part as an

institution and he is right about that

and yet in his opening statement a

document he had time to draft and

consider his tone was positively

trumpian this whole two-week effort has

been a calculated and orchestrated

political hit fueled with a parent

pent-up anger about President Trump and

the 2016 election fear that has been

unfairly stoked about my judicial record

revenge on behalf of the Clintons and

millions of dollars in money from

outside left-wing opposition groups now

that is absolutely horrifying and it is

worth taking him home right now to note

the norm that has just been shattered

because I know that we're all basically

calloused so people talking that way now

but we are supposed to have at least

nine people left in America who do not

talk that way and yet Cavanaugh just all

but came out and said that he's going to

approach his entire tenure as one giant

case of me versus the Lib tard

Cox

and this this brings me to the most

basic question that remains why why this

particular asshole what is he the hill

that conservatives are willing to die on

and I do know that for some of

Cavanaugh's most ardent supporters this

is a purely ideological issue senators

may not say it out loud but this woman

for Cavanaugh did being a gets in

personally as I went abortion to stop

even if it turns out he's guilty I think

I'm still gonna support him and I hope

he gets in because this could be a good

chance to overturn abortion okay so it's

fine it's fine to appoint someone who

has committed sexual assault to the

Supreme Court as long as they will

curtail abortion rights it's a starts

that prioritizes human lives as long as

you think life begins at conception

stops right before a sexual assault and

then starts right back up again

as soon as that assault is over now

obviously obviously I personally do not

agree with that

but even if ending legal abortion is

your ultimate goal

there are many conservative judges who

could deliver that to you without all of

Cavanaugh's issues because purely as a

judge there is nothing unique about

Kavanagh nothing he's not uniquely

qualified Trump reportedly picked him

from a list of 25 names provided by

outside groups like The Federalist

Society whose executive vice president

explicitly pointed out he had no

preference regarding the list is there a

leading contender for you no there's not

really not no it's the list is really

good they're not in order

you're just saying no no no you can

throw a dart at that list and in my view

you'd be fine Wow he answered that

question about Supreme Court justices

like he was just asked which pickle in a

jar

it's his favorite pickle I don't know

man they're all pickles it's a pickle

jar so if it's in this jar it's a

pic

but for some reason the Republican

leadership is continuing to push Cavan

our heart in fact on Friday Lindsey

Graham seem to view Kavanagh with even

more relish I've never felt better

about him being on the bench than I do

right now really you feel better now

than before Cavanaugh testified do you

really mean that or are you afraid that

if you don't say it cabin art will

challenge you to a fight on a boat in

Rhode Island because I do get that he

seems like the type the point is after

all of this I genuinely cannot see a

single good reason for pushing Cavanaugh

over a replacement candidate because you

know deep down any judge they choose is

almost certainly going to restrict

abortion rights you don't need to choose

an unhinged partisan with multiple

accusations of sexual misconduct hanging

over him so it feels like they're doing

this just to deliver a you to

Democrats and even more directly a

you to women because when this when this

week began the biggest fear for many was

that the committee would not believe

Christine Blasi Ford but by the time the

week ended it seemed that something

darker might have happened because it

seemed that response was oh we believe

you we just don't care and the tragic

thing is she knew this was a possibility

she said so explicitly during her

testimony once he was selected and it

seemed like he was popular and that was

a sure vote I was calculating daily the

the risk benefit for me of coming

forward and wondering whether I would

just be jumping in front of a train that

was headed to where it was headed anyway

and that I would just be personally

annihilated she knew publicly reliving

the most traumatic event of her life

could have absolutely no effect on

anything and yet she spoke up anyway it

is absolutely incredible the lengths

that some people will go to for a free

polygraph test look

look look here's the thing here's the

thing I am I am not saying that this is

a done deal just yet they were

desperately pushing Cavanaugh through on

Friday only for extraordinary pressure

to force the reopening of the FBI

investigation which by the way may well

end up being so limited as to be

essentially pointless but the fact is

only continued pressure has even the

slightest chance of stopping Cavanaugh's

confirmation and if he does as seems

increasingly likely make his way to the

court we should never forget how that

happened all what he represents we

certainly will not forget it on this

show you may know that for years we've

had an all dog Supreme Court with dogs

playing the justices from Samuel Alito

to Ruth Bader Ginsburg right good dog

good dog dunk die good dog good dog

sit sit and don't die now now now since

2017 it's actually been a mostly dog

Supreme Court because kneel course hich

is represented on it's by a lobster and

that's because his seat was stolen from

Merrick Garland's there for like a

lobster he does not belong there but

Cavanaugh Cavanaugh if he is seated

doesn't even deserve that treatment he

deserves something that constantly

reminds people who he is something

hostile consistently UPS unsettling

temperamentally unpleasant and that

screams who the allowed this to

happen so I pray that we will not have

to use this but if we do I see no more

fitting embodiment of Cavanaugh than

this

[Music]

yes that's right

just actual Supreme Court

have to deal with Cavanaugh animal

Supreme Court should not have to deal

with this new tainted carpet swatch that

appears to be tweaking on bath socks

I truly hope it does not come to this

and look there is still a chance that we

can stop it so please call your senators

tomorrow and tell them you do not want

to be looking at this for the next 30

years 10 off the bench

you're not even confirmed yet no I don't

want a beer

I don't want to be in your big weirdo

get off that bench you entitled monster

you

fatal we're so used to it it has become

a fixture of American life down here too

short one minute you got three girls in

the jacuzzi

next minute somebody's in jail and you

have to bail them out that's what

happens down into short

the other thing that happens down at the

shore

chlamydia just a medically astounding

rate of chlamydia and it's heart

America's bail system sounds pretty

simple if you're charged with a crime

the court might ask for an amount of

money as bond and then return it to you

once you show up for trial and if you

have that money it's no big deal but if

you don't you can be in big trouble just

look at one example a man called nig

well he was arrested for driving with a

suspended license the court set bail at

$1,000 and he had a choice pay it all

await a trial in Rikers Island I don't

let me well and his wife take the story

from there a wooden bush Rikers on my

worst enemy

cuz it's rough it was hard and it's a

bomb I had to try to borrow money from

this person and this person and this

person should try to get him out he told

the judge I can't afford a thousand

dollar bail so he really didn't have a

choice but to plead guilty now whether

he was guilty or not the fact is a

non-violent offender spent time in

Rikers because he didn't have a thousand

dollars and this is a systemic problem

increasingly bail has become a way to

lock up the poor regardless of guilt

because we go Nick what was a family man

who posed no danger to society

whatsoever and he was stuck in Rikers

whereas millionaire Robert Durst who'd

been accused of murder in Texas had a

completely different experience at the

bail system I had been told by the

detective that you've been charged with

murder bail has been set at 250 thousand

dollars but was your intention when you

put up the $250,000 to run away Oh

goodbye $250,000 goodbye Jail I'm out

I'm out

that of course is an excerpt from robert

durst children's books

goodbye jail goodbye money

goodbye bail I killed them all but

goodbye jail of course of course

the problem is the frequency and cost of

bail have risen dramatically and it is

disproportionately hurting the poor in

fact in 2013 an analysis of New Jersey's

jail population found that nearly 40%

were being held solely because they

couldn't meet the terms of their bail

which is crazy jail is supposed to be

for dangerous criminals in 40% of a

group don't meet the basic criteria to

be there that should change your

perception of what that group is if 40%

of the Girl Scouts were grown men you

feel weird about buying cookies from

them so so what happens if you can't

make bail well much like a game of marry

kill with crosby Stills and Nash there

are a few terrible scenarios

option one you sit in jail and again if

you're poor as this defense attorney

explains that has immediate consequences

our clients work at jobs where if you're

absent you're fired

our clients live in shelters or in

transitional housing places where if

you're not there for the night your

place is gone so there are a lot of

different ways in which incarceration

even for a short period of time can

really destroy someone's life

exactly jail can do for your actual life

what being in a marching band can do for

your social life even if you're just in

for a little while it could destroy you

destroy that many defendants who can't

afford bail favor option number two

simply pleading guilty even if you're

not as a former public defender explains

you sit in jail because you can't afford

to pay your way to freedom and you're

often confronted with a deal that goes

like this plead guilty get out maintain

your innocence and go to trial stay in

and poor people are regularly choosing

to admit guilt just to get out of there

which isn't good the only time that's

appropriate is in a Catholic

confessional what what do you mean is

there anything else I don't know I

masturbated into a kiwi fruit is that

what you're they just let me leave I

have stuff to do

and the problem is if you do plead

guilty to a crime you didn't commit that

has its own downsides because

unfortunately on a job application next

to the question have you ever been

convicted of a crime check yes or no

most don't then leave four pages of

blank space to explain the social and

economic inequalities inherent in the

legal system and that brings us to your

final option commercial bail bondsmen

you know the people who make amazing ads

like these ruffies bail bonds has busted

out all over Middle Tennessee I ain't

going out like this

Oh my culprit bill balls cuz they got

calling me Miriam Jesus break bail bonds

for 10:00 to 9:00 to 302 that you're

locked up in the frame yes

well I will say it is a little weird

given that Jesus pretty memorably I

think was not bails out I mean he did

eventually escaped custody but it was a

real workaround of the system here here

is how that system works no bail

bondsmen promised the court to pay your

bail if you fail to show up for a trial

in exchange you pay them 10 to 15% of

the bail amount which they then keep

regardless of how your trial goes so if

your bail is $5,000 and you're found

innocent then you've basically just paid

a 750 dollar fee to a bondsman for doing

absolutely nothing wrong and paying $750

for absolutely nothing should be

reserved for one thing and one thing

only

six-month gym memberships that's it

you're not going to use it Gerald you're

gonna use the treadmill twice and that's

it this is learning to speak Korean all

over again - and if you don't show up

for your trial bail bondsman routinely

hire bounty hunters to track you down

and they have a frightening amount of

power in all but four states the

companies are legally allowed to take

almost any measure necessary to capture

a client including crossing state lines

and breaking into homes it's a dangerous

business for everyone involved with few

rules and little oversight oh they're

not kidding in 18 states anyone can

become a bounty hunter regardless of

education training or prior criminal

history becoming a bounty hunter is

basically a lot like becoming a social

media expert all it takes is want to get

bad enough and not caring about whether

strangers hate you or not

but but then the news that any idiot can

be a bounty hunter shouldn't really be

that surprising to you if you've ever

turned on A&E and stumbled across at

this I am along

Oh God when I say they know what I'm

saying

[Music]

the only way this guy will get away from

us is if it kills himself right now

and jumps into a pool of sharks okay

okay I hate to be a stickler over

chronology dawg

but how do you kill yourself and then

jump into a pool of sharks but that's

the kind of attention to detail job that

makes me worry about you operating as an

unregulated vigilante now that show was

so popular inspired pretty much every

other Bale business to pitch themselves

as a reality show just click around

online and you will find sizzle reels

for a veritable smorgasbord of similar

shows we're coming to get you the

natural high you got to think like I do

you like that and we get quicker than

that you want tough you want action meet

big Benning they call it a teddy bear

Denyce huntress it doesn't stop there

there's also Richard the screwdriver

Richard out the other Richard Alison the

greco-roman wrestler Caroline the one

who took up archery after watching The

Hunger Games and don't forget Jennifer

the arthritic alpaca in a bowler hats

actually you know what I now regret

making fun of that now that I'm seeing

the cast I get the appeal I want to see

those characters grow clearly these

shows are in a competitive marketplace

and the problem is when people try to

stick out ideas like this happen

so what do we do differently we don't

just gonna hurt without this each week

two new teams about waters

[Music]

go head-to-head welcome to the most

dangerous competition on television

belches okay first of all first of all

the most dangerous competition on

television is the Bachelorette those

women have left and they've lost lovers

are awarded but it's also a risk it's a

risk she's put herself on the line she's

there for the right reasons and second

it says something about how comfortable

we all are with how our bail system

works that a TV show where people with

guns hunt humans for sport seems

legitimate because we just think well

they're just doing their actual job and

when you give bounty hunters this kind

of power bad things happen

veteran Jean Travis says he was sitting

with his wife on his Bethpage front

porch next thing he knows his barn is

being searched and Travis has a stun gun

pointed at his back the intruders mark

Drummond and his wife Angela bounty

hunters who police say had the wrong

home clay was shot by one of the

bondsman

he was then transported to Ermac where

he died was a bounty hunter justified in

tasing a Midwest City homeowner last

Saturday was another justified in

shooting his dog police say the

videotape they took says no yeah the

video says no basic human decency says

no even a magic 8-ball having seen that

with saying holy I can't believe

you're even asking me

our current bail system makes no sense

and it does a lot of harm and the

frustrating thing is we've known this

for a long time just watch this TV news

special from 1964 yes the jails are

bursting at the seams a problem of great

concern to New York City Commissioner of

Correction and across remaining in jail

because you can't get bail is really

being punished before you're even found

guilty as far as I was concerned that

was not just that was destroying our

concept of justice that's right

this problem has been obvious since it

was considered okay to wear a

wastebasket on your head

look here's here's the good news there

is a better way and it's already in use

in our federal courts and in Washington

DC judges in Washington are allowed to

set money bail only if the defendant can

afford it the results have been far

fewer people spending time behind bars

we are the only city in America where

tonight at our Jail there is not a

single man or woman who is sitting

because they don't have the money to

meet their money back and it's a

testament it's a testament to the state

of our justice system that that

qualifies as bragging because that

should be the norm

he's like a bus driver showing up at

school saying 23 kids picked up 23 kids

dropped off I pitched a perfect game

pretrial services works like this after

you're arrested specialists assess if

you if you're dangerous or a flight risk

if a judge decides that you're not you

can go home and they may monitor you

with things like drug tests or ankle

monitors they even call you to remind

you of your court date it's a system

built on interviews pre-arranged

appearances and trusts much like

Scientology marriages only in this case

much more effective and pretrial service

programs have succeeded around the

country in places ranging from Oregon to

Florida and it is a truly frightening

state of affairs when Florida is a model

for progressive change it shouldn't be a

judicial example for anything did you

know by the way that under Florida law

if you possess all the 5 grams of meth

you can marry it that's a fact that's a

legal fact that's an actual photo that

ran in a newspapers wedding section in

Florida and yet and yet even counties in

Florida recognized our money bail system

is broken and not only is pretrial

services better it's cheaper a recent

assessment of one system showed it

costing only 1/10 as much as keeping

someone locked up which makes sense

because

calling someone to check in costs

virtually nothing this message brought

you by your mother your mother

she brought you into this world and we

got to your king bollocks once in a

while so if pretrial services are fair

up better and cheaper why aren't we all

using it or maybe because thanks to

reality shows we think that this is what

justice looks like we're gonna hunt this

gun down bad dog so so maybe we just

need a new kind of reality show to get

us used to the alternative you want up

you want action meet Steve Carr

he's one of the most respected pretrial

services caseworkers in the United

States so let's see okay it looks like

you were ticketed with public urination

no priors seems like a one-off sort of

thing can we count on you to be back

here in six weeks for your trial of

course great we're done here no this is

a routine thing statistically he's

virtually guaranteed to turn oh we're

done here

we're done here Steve by hand grenade

to the crack team of legal enforcers

meet Deborah hello this is Debra from

pretrial services I'm just calling to

remind you about your upcoming court

date this Thursday well you're welcome

I feel like it I can't you know

back to work and then there's Brett so

all these are risk assessments this is

all computerized but you know I keep a

yeah a hard copy just in case that's why

they call him the Annihilator

and finally Gerald the guy in charge of

urine tests clear if there's something

in there that's illegal

I will sniff it out so that's what I do

I'm a piss sniffer

we got one because this fall we'll be

bringing you all the thrills and

excitement of pretrial supervision if

this elite team brings people to justice

well we don't bring them to justice it's

more like we make arrangements for them

to bring themselves to justice ignore

that this show is full of high-stakes

drama pray I don't get you for Secret

Santa this year

Debra and interoffice romance gerald is

a blood

uh-huh yeah she wants me and if it were

to follow their cats I would hit that I

would knock the bottom out most

we take you closer to the action

[Music]

pretrial services coming this fall to

A&E it's cast effective mother

[Applause]

you

We're gonna talk about
the media,

specifically, one increasingly
influential member of it,

Alex Jones,

the Walter Cronkite of shrieking
batshit gorilla clowns.

(CROWD LAUGHING)

And I know you may be thinking,

there is nothing more I need
to know about Alex Jones.

Because you've probably seen
crazy clips like this.

ALEX JONES:
What do you think tap water is?

It's a gay bomb, baby.

And I'm not saying people
 didn't naturally

have homosexual feelings.
 I'm not even getting into it.

You think I-- (GUFFAWS)
I'm like shocked by it,

so I'm up here bashing it
because I don't like gay people?

(YELLS) I don't like 'em
putting chemicals in the water

that turn
the friggin' frogs gay!

Do you understand that?

(GRUNTS) Crap!

Wow. If he is that upset about
a government conspiracy

that is not happening,
just imagine how upset

he's gonna be when he finds out
about one that is actually is.

Like the fact
that the government

is turning raccoons bi-lingual.

Oh, that's right, they're all
fluent in French now

and they will be working
that into conversation.

And that famous clip
is by no means and outlier.

Jones is a charismatic performer
who gets charged up

on a regular basis,
so there are plenty

of lesser known outbursts
like this...

My spirit is close than evil
and I feel it

and my whole spirit just goes...
(SCREAMS)

They call that crazy,
that's not crazy,

that's my will,
my human spirit saying,

"Crush those
that would hurt the innocent!

Go after the enemy,
build a civilization,

be honorable!

Crush the snakes under
your feet!"

Well, at least now we know
what Friday Night Lights

would've looked like
if they'd given Coach Taylor

-a nasty PCP habit.
-(CROWD LAUGHING)

Go after the enemy!

Crush the snakes
under your feet! (SNIFFS)

Clear ice, full house.
I've got the snakes everywhere!

Stop those snakes,
motherfuckers. (SCREAMS)

(CROWD CLAPPING AND CHEERING)

Now look, ideally, ideally,
the first thing you should know

about The Alex Jones Show,
is nothing.

But, unfortunately,
it is an important part

of a lot of people's
media diets.

An estimated six million people
listen to his radio show

or watch it online every week,

and we know at least
one Jones fan seems to be

current Russian Ambassador
to the United States,

-Donald Trump.
-(CROWD LAUGHING)

He-- he supposedly called Jones
after the election,

has tweeted content from
Infowars and one of its editors

and just a year and a half ago,
even appeared on his show.

TRUMP:
 I just wanna finish by saying,

your reputation's amazing.
I will not let you down.

You will be very,
very impressed, I hope

and I think we'll be speaking
a lot.

The only thing that could've
made that moment any grosser

is if Nigel Farage, Bill Cosby
and Phil Spector

-were all on the same call.
-(CROWD GROANING)

So look, it is no wonder
that Jones has been getting

a lot of coverage, recently.

We even mentioned him
on our first show of the season,

back in February
and in his response to it,

he seemed a little annoyed
with me.

Your ratings are in the toilet,
you're a joke,

they brought you back,
revamped...

out of the gate,
to attack yours truly.

After you lectured us
that Donald Trump

could never win,
over and over again,

as you know,
you're the intellectual,

everybody knows a British accent
is intellectual.

(CROWD LAUGHING)

You know, there's no facts
behind it.

And now, you make fun of me
out of context,

and I'll go,
"Look at this loon!"

Hey boy, people want legitimacy,
they want real.

They want to hear somebody
that can speak to 'em

and touch 'em inside.

-(CROWD GROANING)
-Okay, okay, I--

A few things there.
One, don't call me boy.

And two, my British accent
does not sound intellectual.

Believe me, I sound
like a chimney sweep

passing through a wood chipper.

But-- but I will give him this,
Jones is right,

that too often, people don't
present him in his full context.

So tonight,
we are going to do that,

and let's first set aside
the key context,

that Alex Jones has repeatedly
used his show

to fuel speculation
that the Sandy Hook Massacre

was staged by the government,
which has been deeply hurtful

for the parents of those
children over the years.

That is disgusting
and should be disqualifying

in terms of ever taking
him seriously.

Sadly, doing things
that disqualify you

from being taken seriously,

doesn't really seem to be much
of a thing anymore.

But-- but there is a piece
of context,

you may be less aware of

and that concerns the nature
of Jones' show itself.

It is four hours long,

and if you tune
into the whole thing,

your most shocking discovery
might be how frequently

and shamelessly he pitches
products that he sells.

In fact, remember that clip from
him earlier,

yelling about snakes?

Let's just go back to that
and play it out a bit.

Be honorable! Crush the snakes
under your feet!

(SIGHS) Get behind me, Satan!

(PANTING) Now before I go
any further...

before I go any further...

we gotta fund this operation,

we got the very best
nutraceuticals out there.

I don't know if I can run this
for another week or so,

we wanna run this
through the end of the month,

that's like 11 days.

'Cause I don't want it
to sell out before more gets in

infowarslive.com!

Woah! That is a hard turn
to have to make.

(YELLS) The Satan-worshiping
deep state globalists

are gonna murder you
and your entire family!

Open your eyes, sheeple,
they are coming for you,

they're coming for all of us!

(CLEARS THROAT)

But first...

-McGillicuddy's Oatmeal.
-(CROWD LAUGHING AND CLAPPING)

The perfect way
to start your day.

And look, that clip
is not an anomaly.

In one week of recent broadcast
on his sight,

we found he spent nearly
a quarter of the time,

either talking about
or playing ads for his products,

or pointing you
to the Infowars store.

And if you have never gone
shopping on Infowars, you are in

for whatever the exact opposite
of a treat is.

Because there's the kind
of survival gear

that you would expect
alongside more surprising items

like organic shampoo,
body wash and deodorant

as well as products like
Combat One Tactical Bath Wipes

a ten-dollar pack
of moist towelettes

that can be used anywhere
needed,

including the perineal area.

Which, if you're wondering,
is this region, right here.

-(CROWD GROANING)
-That's right, Alex Jones

is trying to sell you
sloppy wet rags for your tait.

And-- and when you are done
wiping down

the area between your genitals
and anus

with a glorified wet nap...

why not pick up
a Bill Clinton Rape Whistle?

Which, according to Infowars,
should be used

to let Bill know
you're in the crowd

and that you know the truth.

That truth, by the way...

You just spent six dollars
on a whistle.

Oh, that's right we bought this
and by the way our order came

with a free
"9-11 was an inside job"

-bumper sticker...
-(CROWD GROANING)

...that we most assuredly
did not ask for. And look...

radio hosts doing ads
is not inherently unusual,

but since 2013,
Jones has increasingly focused

on promoting his own products,
which he sells on his site

under his Infowars Life brand,

particularly, vitamins
and nutraceuticals,

which I believe are the result
of the word, "nutrition"

fucking the word
"pharmaceutical" from behind.

(BED CREAKING)

I'm pretty sure
that's what it is,

but this-- this is a big part
of Jones' business.

Two thirds of his funding
reportedly comes

from selling his products
and they are a lot of them.

And the reason I know that
is we bought a whole bunch.

Now, let me break them down
for you.

There is a Super Male Vitality,
a Super Female Vitality,

"Wake Up America Patriot Blend"
coffee, Lung Cleanse,

Brain Force Plus,
something called DNA Force

that cost 120 dollars a bottle,

and Child Ease, a herbal blend,
which, according to Infowars,

is "designed to sooth the mind
and bodies of children"

which is a profoundly,
creepy phase.

And then, there is Caveman True
Paleo Formula with bone broth,

a chocolate flavored drink mix,
made from bee pollen, stevia

and the dust
of chicken skeletons.

Now, according to Infowars,
it is one of the most popular

new health trend
in the world today.

And by the look on Jones' face,
it tastes

exactly as good as it sounds.

You pour that in on a couple
of ice cubes.

And folks, it tastes...

when it's creamy and thick,
I think, better than Ovaltine.

And it has got all the bone
broth and so much more.

This is why, the ancients,
they believe were--

had such better bones,

were so much healthier,
you can look it up.

This-- you could freeze this
and this will be better

than, like,
bluebell chocolate ice cream.

Mm!

(CROWD LAUGHING)

(LAUGHING) Okay!
Okay, I know for a fact

that Alex Jones did not enjoy
drinking that glass of Caveman.

Because, I have got a glass
of Caveman, right here.

And I can confirm to you
that it tastes...

(COUGHING)

It taste exactly how you imagine
a drink would taste

that's made from chocolate
and domesticated bird corpses.

It-- it comes at you in waves.

And that is not the only time
that Jones has used himself

as a guinea pig to sell
his own products.

And a warning, now,
to our younger viewers,

the following footage of a man
graphically too comfortable

with his own body,
may be disturbing.

Just ten minutes
before we taped this,

I decided to do this
'cause I haven't done this

in a while.
We took photos... a year ago,

And then again
 about six months ago

and the weight loss
 is dramatic,

already from what happened
 before.

(CROWD LAUGHING)

Okay, so you're redder...
and you're wearing a belt.

The only thing I can discern
happened

between those two photos

is that you walked shirtless
in the sun for two hours

to a belt store.

You-- you could flip those
two photos around

and the effect would be
exactly the same. Also...

And look, to be fair to Jones,
he does have a medical expert,

who consults on many
of his supplements,

Doctor Edward Group III,
who looks like the lead

in a Director DVD
Kato Kaelin biopic.

But he's actually even less
impressive than that.

Here he is in an Infowars ad

explaining the importance
of one of the products.

GROUP: If you're suffering
 from abdominal pain,

allergies, even like headaches,
 anemia,

weakened immune system,
 gut problems, depression,

hair loss, uh... excess gas,

muscle pain, nervousness,
I mean, all of these things,

if you look at some
 of these conditions

and then us opening up
 our borders

and all the other countries
opening up our-- their borders,

you're just dealing with
 a mass amount of parasites

or are harmful organisms.

You can type in
 "refugees spreading disease"

I mean, the CDC is going crazy
right now.

Actually, I'm pretty sure
that if you type,

"refugee spreading disease"
into Google and press enter,

it just takes you
right to the Wikipedia page

for xenophobia, which,
at the end of the day,

is a real time saver for you.
But despite the fact

that Doctor Group looks like
what would happen

if Tom Petty was machine washed
instead of dry cleaned...

(CROWD LAUGHING)

... Alex Jones swears by him.

In fact, he's been
pretty defensive

about Doctor Group's
credentials.

It doesn't matter you've got
degrees from MIT

and everywhere else
and a bunch of other degrees,

the media makes fun of you
and says that you're an idiot.

-(SIGHS) That's right.
-I mean literally they say

we cannot sell coffee,
it's a fraud.

That's right, that's right.

I-- I've been
a research scientist

for a long time, I do have--

I am MIT alumni
and I can tell you

that I do research
all the time--

Okay, stop.

A-- Look, let's break down
that "bunch of degrees"

Jones mentioned.

Group does have
a Doctor of Chiropractic degree

from Texas Chiropractic College,

but, while he listed-- lists all
these other schools on LinkedIn

we checked and he didn't
graduate from any of them.

In fact, we asked him
and he admits,

he does not have
an undergraduate degree.

And as for whether he's
an "MIT alumni,"

he only completed a non-degree
certificate program there,

in fact, just to be sure,
we contacted MIT,

and according to them,
"It is not accurate to say

he has a degree from MIT...
and calling him an alumni

would be inaccurate
and misleading."

(CROWD LAUGHING)

Which does make sense
when you think about it.

Because this man doesn't look
like an MIT alumnus.

He looks like
a fifth-year senior

at the University
of Falling Off a Surfboard.

So-- so just to clarify Alex,

that is what we are making
fun of, when we make fun

of Doctor Group.
Well that, and, the fact

that he looks like
what would happen

if Iggy Pop got "The Rachel."

(CROWD LAUGHING)

And look! Jones can inflate
Doctor Group's credentials

all he wants. He says a lot
of crazy shit on his show.

But it is noticeable
that when it comes

to selling his supplements,
he can sometimes show a caution

that is pretty out of character.
Just watch him

bend over backwards
to repeatedly qualify

what he says,
seconds after he said it.

Maybe you've had
back pain before,

maybe you've had nerves
that were cut off.

This creates tingling, this--
A lot of people have

their feeling come back.
I'm not gonna make claims

if this research is true.
Organically based bio PQQ,

but it's not
technically organic.

(CROWD LAUGHING)

The other stuff's synthetic,
(INDISTINCT) are lab-made.

This is made
from organic sources...

but the bacteria is GMO.

I'll just tell ya up front...

but it's not like
the super high-tech stuff.

It's a bacteria that's just
been bred,

to be able to then secrete
and produce.

It's just like beer is bacteria,
it's a lot of good bacteria,

obviously, but this one--

that's how the Japanese do it.
But it's bio-identical.

This stuff is only found
in comets.

And in trace amounts
in blueberries.

(CROWD LAUGHING AND CLAPPING)

Wait. Wait.

OK, so let's break that down.

It repairs nerves
but maybe doesn't.

It's organic but not really.

It contains GMOs, which is bad,

except for when he's
selling you something

and you can only find
its ingredients in comets.

Oh, and blueberries.

And it's the drop off
after that last one

that is really incredible.

You can only find this stuff
in dinosaur bones

and in trace amounts
in Ritz bits.

And look, Jones's products
don't come cheap.

For instance, he sells
this one fluid ounce bottle

of Vitamin D3 for 29.95.

But consumerlab.com,
a supplement watchdog,

points out that you can buy
the same amount of D3,

from other sources,
for less than four dollars.

But Jones will often give you
a hard sell.

Sometimes, he'll tell you
his products are different

than the ones that you can find
in stores,

and sometimes,
he'll go even bigger.

It is absolutely
in the crystalline form,

the strongest, you absorb it.

So, folks, don't go out
to the store and get iodine

from, say,
one of the big chains.

It'll kill you!

Woah! Wow! I honestly
did not know

that you could imply
your competition kills people.

Four out of five dentists
prefer Trident gum

and the fifth dentist is dead
because he put a piece

of Wrigleys in his mouth
and that's basically suicide!

And to hear Jones tell it...
to hear Jones tell it,

his products are marked up

just enough to keep
his business going.

As he explained
in his recent appearance on,

Rationalizing Low Ratings
with Megyn Kelly.

It may cost 45, 50 million
dollars a year, around that.

How much money is being made?

Well, the money that's made

is pretty much put back
into things.

Okay, so that is remarkable
for two reasons.

First, 45 to 50 million dollars
is a lot of money.

And second,
Jones would have you believe

that every penny they earn
is being plowed back

into a show that looks
like it was filmed on the set

of a low-budget porn parody
of itself.

In fact, as he frequently tells
is audience,

he needs them to buy more
to keep

his truth telling crusades
solvent and growing.

JONES:
 We need to fund ourselves,

and we find ourselves
 by you buying the products.

We're at a shortfall now
because of the massive,

sustained economic attacks
we're under, but the listeners

in just two weeks
have almost narrowed that gap.

I could have to sell my house...

to keep this place running
three, four months.

I could have sponsors
every segment.

I don't do it.
I plug enough to fund things.

Fund us, give me the energy

and I will attack the enemy.

Exactly! It's like
an NPR pledge drive

for people who hate NPR.
Because to listen to Jones,

Infowars is perpetually
on the edge of disaster.

He even has a link
on the Infowars store,

where you can just
give him money,

to help fund the fight
against tyranny.

And contributors
have left comments like,

"Twenty-five dollars
may not be much,

but I know
every little bit helps."

But Jones seems
to be doing a bit more

than just keeping his head
above water.

Ex-employees describe
a thriving business

with one saying,
"He can sell 500 supplements

in an hour...
It's like QVC for conspiracy."

And in one of those clips
we showed earlier,

we noticed he's wearing
what looks like a Rolex watch

worth around 8000 dollars.

Which... cool.

And, y'know,
as we looked around,

we noticed he also seems to have
another two different Rolexes.

And you know... cooler.

And here's the thing,
that is honestly fine.

He can have fancy watches.

There is nothing wrong
with him getting paid.

I get paid to make this show.

But it does fight
with his message

that he needs you
to buy products

to help keep his show going.
And even Alex Jones

seems to be
a little self-conscious

about that disconnect.

But don't worry,
he's reconciled it

in a truly amazing way.

I wear a blue sports coat
and a Rolex

because it's a symbol
of middle-class

and humanity having prosperity
and promoting human prosperity

for respect
of empowering humanity

and stealing the image
of a man in a sports jacket

with a Rolex,
that is the satanic image.

So, I dress as a Satanist,

so that I can enter their world
and show you

that none of it means anything.

Oh bullshit!

How stupid do you think
your audience is?

Okay, you bought a Rolex

so you could dress up
like a Satanist.

What are the other two for?

And incidentally tormenting
the parents of Sandy Hooke

should comfortably get you
into the satanic club.

I believe that's the easy pass
to whatever hell's version

of the champagne room is.

And look, so, at the start
of this piece,

I promised Alex Jones
that I would put his statements

in context, because he is right

that if you place small clips
in isolation,

he looks like a loon.

But if you play them in context,

he looks like a skilled salesman
spending hours a day

frightening you about problems
like refugees spreading disease

and then selling you an answer.

Remember that gay frog clip
at the start?

He did a follow-up show,
explaining how chemicals

were being placed in the water
to feminize society

and reduce the population,

and then immediately
segued to this...

We shell five different brands
of the very best water--

water filtration systems
 out there.

They're amazing,
 they cut out 99.99 percent

of the glyphosate,
 the herbicides,

the pesticides, the fluoride.

I mean to an untrained eye,
it sure seems like

he was using the idea
of a gay frog

to sell his products, which,
incidentally is the same mistake

-the WB network made.
-(CROWD LAUGHING)

And-- and listen, listen!
I'm not saying-- I'm not saying

the only reason Jones is talking
about the globalist,

systematically feminizing us,

is to sell over-priced
nutraceuticals

so he can buy luxury watches,
but if I were saying that,

it certainly wouldn't be
the stupidest conspiracy theory

that you've heard
so far, tonight.

So, if Alex Jones wants
his words in context,

this is it.

The fact that he happens to sell
so many solutions

should really re-contextualize
how you think

about what he is claiming
are problems.

Think about it like this.
How would you feel,

if at the end of this segment
that may well have made you

feel a little dirty, I tried
to sell you something

to wipe that gross feeling away?
Would you question my motives?

Well, I certainly hope not,

because that's what we are doing
right now.

(CROWD CHEERING)

Come with me. Come with me
because I'm proud to say

that we've been working
with a leading medical expert,

and I would like you
to meet him right now.

Please, please welcome
Doctor Ted Group III.

-(CROWD CHEERING)
-Doctor Ted.

Ah, so happy to be here.

We-- we're so happy
to have you, doctor.

A-- and we are-- we are here,
the doctor and I, to offer you

the John Oliver Moisture Armored
Tactical Assault Wipe.

The first tactical wipe
for use, exclusively,

on the perineal.

That's right.
Uh, for goodness sake,

don't use this anywhere else.
You're gonna wanna just focus...

-Right.
-...on this area right here.

-JOHN: OK.
-DOCTOR: Right here.

Now... now... now Doctor,

Doctor, how is this going
to make people feel better

about what they've seen tonight?
How...

Well my studies show
that when you vigorously apply

this taint wipe,
it causes a sensation

that distracts the brain
from whatever it had previously

-been thinking about.
-(CROWD LAUGHING)

OK, and again,
you've got degrees from MIT,

and everywhere else,
and a bunch of other degrees.

The media makes fun of you
and says that you're an idiot.

-They do.
-(CROWD LAUGHING)

Just-- just for the record,
you did go to MIT, right?

Well I've definitely
physically been there.

That's... that's essentially
the same.

That's what I've been telling
everybody.

Now-- now you can actually
buy one of these wipes

at infowipes.com
for one million dollars.

This is real.
They are actually available

for a million dollars apiece,

and don't even think
about buying a similar wipe

in a store, because those wipes
will kill you.

Yeah, also, these wipes
have the power

to heterosexualize frogs.

So uh, that's very nice to have,

'cause that's been
a real problem

-what with all the refugees.
-(CROWD GROANS AND LAUGHS)

And look-- look, this tactical
taint wipe has demonstrated

incredible results,
hasn't it, Doctor?

Absolutely, it sure has.

Look at this photo of me.

And now look at this photo of me
 forty-five minutes later...

-after applying the taint wipe.
-(CROWD LAUGHING AND CLAPPING)

You-- you're much redder there.

-I'm so much redder!
-So much redder!

-So disturbingly red!
-So much...

So, if you want to spend
a million dollars

on a taint wipe,
go to infowipes.com,

and if you're thinking, "Well,
no one's going to do that,"

all I will say is, people pay
Alex Jones 45 dollars

for a jar of chocolate flavored
chicken juice,

so anything is fucking possible.

[Music]

the police who as these Montana cops

show frequently have to deal with

humanity at its worst

what's the first amendment what's the

first name Dan right we're at it what's

the first amendment you don't even know

ah Constitution yeah yeah Constitution

absolutely read it and live by it let's

have a seat in the back of the car

let us see Ron Paul 2012 and he's as

perfect it's it's not like he needed to

say Ron Paul 2012 that was implicit in

everything he said up to that point but

it's certainly nice to have it confirmed

now as you know the police have been at

the center of a great deal of

controversy lately it's been impossible

to escape from the black lives matter

movement to Colin Kaepernick's protest

to mary j blige awkwardly singing a

Springsteen song at Hillary Clinton is

it a gun is it a nice is it or wallet

this is your life you can hear kill just

living in your American skin

oh hello me thank you

Oh God Oh God

Hilary would have won my undying respect

if she just looked mary j blige straight

in the face and said I support your

message but that was awkward as and

I wish you hadn't done it that would

have been honest now now the trust

between police and the communities they

serve

is clearly a cornerstone of civilized

society unfortunately that Trust has

been rocked following a series of

controversial police shootings from

Elton Sterling to Philander Casteel to

Tamir rice to so many others I literally

cannot mention them all and cumulatively

these deaths taken with countless

smaller incidents of police misconduct

have led to a common refrain listen I

just want the police to be held

accountable we just want the system of

policing to be held accountable those

police need to be held accountable the

same way that you gonna hold me

accountable if I broke the law whenever

they mess up whenever they commit a

crime whenever something goes wrong I'm

too much serious stuff like murder and

whatnot

these guys never get prosecuted now

those are valid frustrations although as

a quick sidenote murder and whatnot

would be an amazing CSI spin-off that's

a watchable show right there so police

accountability is what we're going to be

talking about tonight and before we go

any further I should say as the police

will tell you they have a difficult

dangerous challenging job no reasonable

person would disagree with that but

that's all the more reason for ensuring

that it's done to the highest standard a

cake decorator has a challenging job but

the worst thing that happens if he

up is you end up wishing someone a happy

anniversary and yeah well that's

obviously not ideal who knows maybe it's

their anal versary too

the police will also argue that what

they have is less an institutional

problem than it is an individual one

there's been some bad apples out there I

think that but I don't think that that

is indicative of the entire police

department yeah you got bad apples but

you got bad apples and every occupation

just like any business you're gonna have

some bad apples they're out to protect

you and that's what policing is about

are there bad apples yeah okay

that is a weirdly blasé attitude because

bad apples can erode trust fast Snow

White

wasn't afraid of apples before she took

a bite out of that one really bad one

but I'm telling you the next time an old

lady comes out there with a piece of

fruit snow is gonna get the can up there

and that argument it's just a few bad

apples has some real problems for a

start it doesn't address bad laws and

policies that good officers are made to

enforce which we've touched on multiple

times before criminal justice is kind of

our show's signature bit it is to us

what assessing the shape of your poop is

to dr. oz also you can't claim there's

just a few bad apples when no one knows

exactly how many there are there are

nearly 18,000 different police

departments in America and they are not

great about reporting or sharing data in

fact even some surprisingly basic

questions are hard to answer as the head

of the FBI admits we can't have an

informed discussion because we don't

have data people have data about who

went to a movie last weekend or how many

books were sold or how many cases of the

flu walked into an emergency room and I

cannot tell you how many people were

shot by police in the United States last

month last year or anything about the

demographics how is that possible we

have numbers for almost everything we

have ratings for how many people watched

Jeremy Piven in mr. selfridge the

government even tracks how many people

are killed by falling TVs each year a

number surely inflated by people who are

watching mr. Selfridge and said I choose

death and then pull the

down on top of it in fact the best

numbers on police misconduct come from a

researcher named Philip Stinson who

accumulated over a decade's worth of

data by setting up 48 google alerts in

2005 Google Alerts and his stats are

truly chilling out of thousands of fatal

police shooting since 2005 only 77

officers have been charged with murder

or manslaughter and to date only 26 have

been convicted and while the truth is

many police shootings are justified 26

seems suspiciously low so how can that

be the number well broadly speaking most

investigations of police misconduct

faced a few obstacles and the first one

is big misconduct is often investigated

internally by officers colleagues which

does not inspire confidence although if

you listen to the police chief in

Bakersville California the system is

just fine

you're absolutely confident that

structure of review is entirely

impartial

I am I these guys are experts in the

field they reported ahamed they're

investigating they have hundreds of

years of law enforcement experience

combined and so I have the utmost

confidence in these individuals here's

the thing their combined experience is

not a thing that automatically makes you

do a better job our staff has a combined

347 years in television and that doesn't

mean we won't just throw off load of

raisins on a desk and call it

entertainment and and and unsurprisingly

the DOJ has consistently found flaws

with internal investigations in

Cleveland investigators admitted they

intentionally cast an officer in the

best light possible when investigating a

use of deadly force and in Miami

investigations took so long that at

least two officers shot and killed a

suspect while still under investigation

for a previous shooting and there should

never be a second one of anything before

you figure out whether the first was

justified call it the Dolphin Tale to

rule how is there a second one of these

I thought Harry Connick jr. ate the

dolphin at the end of the first one I

don't know for sure I haven't seen it

but no one has and that's the

point and in Baltimore the DOJ report

included the story of Joe crystal a

detective who had reported to fellow

officers for alleged excessive force and

was labeled a rat with one colleague

leaving pictures of cheese on his desk

which is almost charming until you learn

how far some others went he found

himself cut off he says he didn't get

back up in dangerous situations

someone even left a dead rat and his

windshield was like their way of telling

me you know you don't belong here this

is what we think of you ouch

leaving a dead rat on an officer's

windshield is definitely hostile unless

of course that officer is a police cat

in which case it means welcome to the

force whiskers we're lucky to have you

enjoy the rat but police accountability

doesn't just suffer from an unwritten

code of silence that code can be

enshrined within state laws or union

contracts as well for instance one

reason it can be hard to spot problem

officers is that in many jurisdictions

policies allow disciplinary records to

be destroyed in Baton Rouge a sustained

complaints can be stricken from your

record after just 18 months and in Mesa

Arizona when a journalist started

demanding records a police chief

actually made an internal video

reminding his officers that there was a

way for them to clean up their past

I don't want anybody have to relive a

problem that's already been adjudicated

that they've already been disciplined

for that has already seen the scrutiny

in the public eye so perjure files

according to policy make sure that

there's that the things that you don't

want in there aren't in there that seems

wrong you should not be able to erase

parts of your past that are damning this

is an official police file not like

Volkswagen corporate history that

somehow starts after World War two yeah

Nazi cars the choice of the Nazis

and deleting records is not an officer's

only option to escape their past

sometimes after an incident they'll

simply resign and move to another Police

Department this happened so much people

in law enforcement called them gypsy

cops in South Carolina TV station looked

into one officer who spent a total of

nine years on the job working for nine

different departments three of them in

just one year and in one case he left in

spectacular fashion deputies believe

Yarborough's driving ability was

compromised and they said they

discovered a half-empty bottle of rye

whiskey and a baggie of assorted pills

in his patrol cruiser according to the

state records Yarborough said I'm not

taking no drug test

I guess I'll resign holy I'm not

taking no drug test

I guess I'll resign is a sentence you do

not want to hear from a police officer

it's barely appropriate coming from a

roadie leaving Aerosmith and gypsy cops

have been involved in tragic incidents

in the Tamir rice case the officer who

shot the twelve-year-old had been in the

process of being fired from his previous

job before resigning

but the Cleveland Police missed that red

flag when hiring him because they didn't

read his personnel file which detailed

an incident during weapons training

where he had a dangerous loss of

composure leading his supervisor to

conclude I do not believe time nor

training will be able to change or

correct these deficiencies that is the

kind of performance review that should

keep you from getting hired at Staples

let alone a job where you're given a

f--king gun that cop by the way was

never even charged like many such cases

his never made it past the grand jury

which seems inherently surprising until

you realize local prosecutors and cops

have to work together all the time which

can get very complicated as a former

prosecutor I can tell you you work with

the police you rely upon the police you

trust the police the police are in your

office reviewing evidence examining

evidence preparing for trial and then

have to turn around and prosecute them

to prosecute you exactly for a

prosecutor to go after a cop they work

with is incredibly awkward

I can't think of anything more

inherently awkward other than of course

this oh thank you oh god oh god it's not

getting any better nothing in Hillary's

life has ever been more awkward than

that and think about what a high bar

that is an even when cases go to trial

officers have a major advantage which is

that juries tend to have a natural

predisposition to trust them police

officers truly get a presumption of

innocence whereas most criminal

defendants don't come in with any

presumption of innocence you're swimming

upstream usually a judge will toss the

case at a preliminary hearing or a grand

jury will refused to indict so you never

even get the trial and jurors just do

not come in with any belief whatsoever

that officers can commit a crime they

just don't it's true many people see a

police uniform and automatically think

trustworthy unless of course it includes

a sleeveless shirt and a boom box in

which case they think stripper and

sometimes weight gym from middle school

and under under the law the police

generally have a certain amount of

leeway regarding lethal force meaning

that fatal shootings can be considered

legal even if they are unnecessary or

disproportional there is even a

shorthand for such cases it's lawful but

awful which I believe is also the legal

definition of Woody Allen's marriage I

think that's it

who are you angry with here

put the booze back in your pockets and

on top of all this officers can bring in

expert witnesses who can present nearly

any situation as a potential threats

take dr. bill Nowinski who runs

something called the force Science

Institute for years he has testified on

behalf of police officers here he is

providing a rationale for why it may be

okay to shoot someone that has a knife

knives can actually be more dangerous

than a gun they don't have to be

reloaded they can be used at close

distance we know that a stab from a

knife or stab or a cut can be extremely

quick hey come on

that is not the motion you make when you

are stabbing someone that is the motion

you make when you are a teenager

magician finishing a trick is this your

card but but there is no doubt there is

no doubt a knife is a dangerous weapon

but what if someone doesn't have a knife

dr. Lewinsky could force still be

necessary when someone is unarmed first

of all it's significant to know that

unarmed doesn't mean they're not

dangerous in fact a fist may have been

the very first weapon that human beings

used against each other I measured

strikes on human beings by other humans

and the strikes can occur at a speed of

four or five or six strikes in a second

and some of them really hard what is he

talking about the only type of fist is a

match for a weapon is during a game of

rock-paper-scissors and even then it can

be defeated by paper with four reasons

which make no sense to me whatsoever but

that's not the point

look look defendants are allowed to call

expert witnesses of course what is weird

is lewinsky has appeared before grand

juries which is where prosecutors are

supposed to present their best

unchallenged case for an officer's

indictment so why would they let

Lewinsky in there they're essentially

shooting their own case in the foot

which is presumably justified because

feet were the second weapon ever

invented

unless we've we focused heavily on

trials here but in a perfect world there

would be enough accountability

throughout policing that the blunt

instrument of a trial would very rarely

be necessary so how can we fix all this

well for starting a body cameras have

increased transparency and Trust in many

places in Rialto California after just

one year of using them the number of

complaints filed against officers fell

by 88% and the use of force drops by

around 60% and when Baltimore's trial

run of a body camera program ended their

Police Commissioner begged for their

return police officers want cameras I

think this is just a moment where

everybody wants cameras I was speaking

to some folks just before we came in

here and apparently we had a couple

police officers who were turning in

their body worn cameras and they were

asking you know when can i when can we

get these back right and these cops

aren't M night Shyamalan if they plead

with you to let them have a camera again

you should give it to them give it to

them and body cameras are obviously just

one solution other cities have tried

requiring officers to file separate

reports every time there's a use of

force or they've used early intervention

systems to try and spot problem officers

or they brought in outside prosecutors

to handle controversial cases the

problem is police unions fiercely fight

any attempted reforms just listen to

James Stewart head of the biggest police

union in Newark where the DOJ found that

three-quarters of police stops had no

legal justification to listen to him if

anything the police are being too

scrutinized I don't know where the

problem started but there is an

animosity or a lack of trust you know as

soon as there's any sort of physical

force exerted by a police officer

everybody's got their cell phones out

you know they want to catch us doing

something wrong when you got the cop out

there in the street facing all this

negative opposition day in and day out

does it come a point when the police

officer is gonna say hey you know what

maybe he doesn't have to go to jail yeah

maybe I'll take the path of least

resistance maybe I'll put the blinders

on as I'm driving by the corner where

the ten guys are hanging out okay yeah

there is a lot to unpack there first

throwing a ten

and threatening not to do your job

because you face public criticism is

pretty childish you think Steven Seagal

gave up on his movie career just because

people said mean things of course not

just this year he starred in end of a

gun the perfect weapon the Asian

connection code of honor and sniper

special ops why cuz he's a king

professional that's why and he commits

to his job but but but more importantly

when you say you might ignore 10 people

hanging out on a corner yeah

maybe do that because that's not

typically a crime in in some cases 10

people on a corner is just a king

yardsale still for many people

Stuart's argument that you know for

police to be effective they need to be

given broad leeway to use force is very

appealing

it's especially appealing for those of

us who for whatever reason are fairly

confident that that force won't be

applied to them but it is worth looking

at the actual cost of that trade-off

because a lack of trust in police

accountability leads to a lack of trust

in police and we now have reached the

point where there are schools who host

classes like this one to teach kids how

to safely interact with law enforcement

I want you to repeat after me I want you

to say officer am I free to go

one more time officer Oh am I free to go

the hope is with this simple advice

teens can protect their rights and maybe

their lives that is so

depressing especially when you realize

that's probably the only class where

nobody will raise their hand and say

when are we ever going to use this and

when you see something like that it

makes it hard to buy in when someone

dismisses police misconduct issues like

this they're out to protect you and

that's what policing is about our abed

apples here yeah but here's the thing

about that the phrase isn't it's just a

few bad apples don't worry about it the

phrase is a few bad apples spoil the

barrel and we currently have a system

which is set up to ignore bad apples

destroy bad apples records persecute

good apples for speaking up and show

all dangerous emotionally unstable

apples around to the point that children

have to attend key Apple classes you

cannot look at our current situation and

claim that anybody likes them apples

Nuclear waste.

The worst type of garbage
for raccoons to get into.

Now, it's a substance
that we all know is dangerous

thanks to movies like this.

NARRATOR: They tormented him
 until he had a horrifying

accident and fell into a bag
 of nuclear waste.

Melvin became
 The Toxic Avenger,

the first superhero born
 out of nuclear waste.

-His face is so terrifying...
-(SCREAMS)

NARRATOR:
...we can't show it to you now.

You'll have to see the movie
 for yourself.

Honestly, you really don't need
to see the movie, 'cause...

his face isn't really
that terrifying. This is it.

I mean it's bad, but its--
it's so ugly,

it's almost cute again.

It's like-- it's like someone
melted a candle shaped

-like a pug.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

But-- but the point here is

nuclear waste, the radioactive
and toxic byproducts

from making nuclear energy
and weapons is

a serious health hazard,
and America has a lot of it.

ANCHOR: There are more than
 71,000 tons of nuclear waste

stranded
 at the nation's 104 reactors.

Put all those
 spent fuel rods together,

and you get a pile
 as big as a football field

and more than 20 feet tall.

Or you could put them
in a pile as big

as two football fields
and ten feet tall

or half a football field
and 40 feet tall.

Or 20 football fields,
one foot tall.

The point is, we have a lot of
nuclear waste and it's very fun

-to play with.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

And look, that is just the waste
from nuclear energy.

We also have more than
100 million gallons

of hazardous liquid waste
from producing weapons.

And you may live closer
to nuclear waste than you think.

One out of three Americas lives
within 50 miles

of high level nuclear waste.

Some of which, like plutonium,
is lethally dangerous,

and will be-- will be around
for an incredibly long time.

NARRATOR: Even microscopic
 amounts of plutonium,

if ingested, are deadly.

One of the characteristics
of it is it has

an extremely long half-life.

Plutonium 239, for example,
has a half life

of about 24,000 years.

It's true, 24,000 years and that
just scratches the surface.

It takes ten half-lives
for plutonium to become harmless

so that's 240,000 years.

A unit of time more commonly
known as one English patient.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

And as any adult with
an American girl doll collection

eventually finds out,
if you wanna keep something

around for a disturbingly
long time, you have got to find

an appropriate place to put it.

"I cannot live
with your murder dolls anymore.

Felicity stares at me
while I sleep!

She stares at me!"

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS, CHEERS)
-"She stares unblinking!"

And look,

I'm not the first person
to make this point.

Look at this news report
from 1990.

NARRATOR:
 Almost half a century

after nuclear power
 was harnessed,

there still is no agreement
 on where to store the waste.

"We have built the house,"
 said one critic,

"and forgotten the toilets."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-A home...

with no toilets. Or as a realtor
selling a Brooklyn loft

is calling it right now,
"artisanal composting."

Wait.

You're suggesting that
I shit in that potted plant

while you and I both know that
I will do that

'cause this is convenient
to public transport,

and has both northern
and eastern exposures.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

But look, it-- it has been
27 years since that clip

and our country still doesn't
have a nuclear toilet.

And that is
our subject tonight.

Why do we not have
a nuclear toilet?

And it's actually easy
to understand how we got

into this situation.
Because during World War Two,

we rushed to develop nuclear
weapons because we were trying

to defeat the Nazis,

who, fun fact, pretty much
all Americans agreed were bad

-at the time.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Anyway, the-- the thing is,

we didn't really have
a plan on what to do

with all the radioactive
byproducts that we produced.

And this initially led us

to some mind-blowingly
stupid solutions.

For instance, for years,
we actually did this...

MAN: They loaded the, uh,

radioactive waste and it was
in barrels, 55 gallon barrels,

of, uh, radioactive waste
with concrete poured over it.

It's funny, the ocean
don't glow out there

outside of Red Bank, New Jersey.
(CHUCKLES)

Really. 'Cause we dumped
a lot of barrels out there.

-(AUDIENCE GASPS)
-That is true.

We didn't just dump barrels
of radioactive waste

in the ocean, we did it
off the coast of New Jersey.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

That is so horrifying!

I'm surprised that Jersey Shore
was the title of a lighthearted

MTV series, and not the name
of a harrowing documentary.

An entire generation of children
was born without thumbs,

a phenomenon known
to locals as...

-"The Situation."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

And, incidentally,

not all of those barrels sank.
In fact, in 1957,

when two barrels were
caught floating off the shore,

naval aircraft were summoned
to strafe them

with machine-gun fire
until they sank.

That's right.

They shot barrels full
of nuclear waste

with machine guns!

That's got to be one of the most
terrifying sentences ever said

out loud, right after,

"Donald Trump is
the president now,"

and, "Wait, wasn't Felicity
on a different shelf

when we went to bed last night?

Oh, my God!
Felicity is a waking nightmare!"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Oh!

Well, the truth is, tossing
barrel-fulls of nuclear waste

into the ocean and shooting them

with machine guns is actually
preferable to at least

one genuine other idea
that was thankfully rejected,

and that was blasting it
into space.

A concept
with a pretty clear flaw.

WOMAN: Unfortunately,

we don't have a great record

with getting rockets
 out into the atmosphere.

If any one of them blew up,

that would basically contaminate

a large portion of the Earth
 with radioactive material.

(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

WOMAN: So that's probably
 not a great idea.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Yeah.

You're right. That's probably
not a great idea.

I mean, a really great idea
would be also filling

the rockets up with confetti,
so at least that way

if there's a horrific accident,
there's also a party!

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Now, over the years, we have
dumped nuclear waste all over

the country and in many places,
there've been frightening leaks.

Take the Savannah River Site
in South Carolina,

where waste from poorly-stored
material leaked

into the ground water.

And just watch this alarmingly
laid back man explain

the consequences of that.

MAN: There are radioactive
 alligators on the site.

(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

MAN: Radioactive materials are
 in the sediments.

-(ALLIGATOR HISSING)
-(CLANGING)

MAN: It's gonna go
 up the food chain and...

there's gonna be
 radioactive alligators.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Yeah.

Radioactive alligators!

They even have names,

Tritagator and Dioxinator,

after two of the wastes
that poisoned them.

And that's actually very clever,

because if I had
to give them names,

I don't know, I'd probably
have gone with something like,

(SCREAMS) "Holy Shit! A Fucking
Radioactive Alligator!"

And, "Oh No, Fuck Me,
There's Another One!

What Nightmare
Hath God Wrought?"

And it's not just reptiles
who've been impacted

by nuclear waste.
Researchers are now studying

an area in North St. Louis
County, Missouri,

where tons of waste
from the Manhattan project was

improperly stored,
some near a creek

that winds through
residential communities,

and people who live there have
noticed some alarming trends.

JENELL WRIGHT: I got on Facebook
 in order to reconnect

with people from high school...

And we all immediately
 started noticing that so many

of us were sick.
 We've discovered that

the Department
 of Veterans Affairs

officially recognizes around 21
cancers associated with exposure

to ionizing radiation,
 and compared that list

to what we had.

We had all of those cancers,
 every single one.

That is an incredibly
depressing thing to discover

on Facebook and it's-- it's hard
to know how to respond.

I mean, you definitely
don't want to use

the "like" button, because...

then it looks
like you really like the fact

they just got cancer.

Now, there is
that new sad emoji,

which would really be perfect

if you hadn't already cheapened
it by using it to respond

to the news that Chris Pratt
and Anna Faris were separating.

I mean, it is sad. It is sad.
But it is not "21-cancer" sad.

It's "nine-cancer" sad.
Tops.

The point is, thankfully,
60 years ago,

our government
and the scientific consensus

came up with a solution.

In 1957, the National Academy
of Sciences issued a report

urging the creation
of a permanent storage facility

deep underground.
Basically, a nuclear toilet.

And while we did build
a repository

for lower-level waste
in New Mexico,

we still haven't built one

for the most dangerous,
high-level waste.

And, as a result, it's
essentially been left

wherever it was made.
Which is not good,

because those facilities
were not built

with the idea that they would be
storing waste indefinitely.

So, to continue the toilet
metaphor,

we've basically been shitting
in bags,

leaving them
all over the house,

and praying
that they don't leak.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

And the most frightening
example of this is

the Hanford Site
in Washington state,

which created two third
of the plutonium

in the US arsenal
and is currently storing

56 million gallons
of highly toxic

and radioactive waste
underground.

And over the years,

there have been so many issues
at Hanford,

that they've achieved
a dubious honor,

as one local
new-station reported,

with an almost prideful tone.

ANCHOR: The most contaminated
 place in the entire

Western Hemisphere isn't
 at a polluting factory

or an old chemical plant.

It's right here
 in Washington State.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
Oh!

"It's right here!
We did it guys!

Washington State, home
to the most contaminated place

in the Western Hemisphere,

thousands of acres
of apple orchards,

and several of Ted Bundy's
grizzliest murders. We did it!

Right here!"

There have been a string
of problems at Hanford,

from explosions,
to toxic vapor releases,

to over a million gallons
of waste

leaking out of their tanks
over the years.

It has been so bad,
the government has had

to pay out nearly
one and a half billion dollars

in compensation to thousands
of workers for illnesses

stemming from exposure
to radiation

and toxic chemicals there.

A local news station has done
a series of reports

on Hanford, and after a tunnel
collapse this May,

they found some of
the infrastructure there is

almost comically badly
put together.

ANCHOR: Mistakes during
 construction are factors

in the dangerous state
 of the tunnels.

They're 55 and 60 years old,

well beyond their expected
 life span.

In addition, wood beams holding
 up the tunnels are eroding,

and what corrodes timber beams?
 Radiation.

Yeah!

You can't build something
out of wood and expect it

to last forever. You're supposed
to have learned that

from the second dumbest
of the Three Little Pigs.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Hanford... Hanford is
a gigantic problem.

And even though it hasn't
produced anything for 30 years,

the Department of Energy
still spends

nearly two and a half billion
dollars a year

on cleaning it up, which is
close to ten percent

of its annual budget.

And it is pretty weird

to find out that a place
you just heard about

is getting that much
of the DOE's money.

It's like finding out that half
the Department of Agriculture

budget goes to this moose
named Gordon.

I mean, I don't know
the right amount,

-but that seems like a lot.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

And in case you're thinking,
"Well I'm definitely glad that

I don't live near Hanford,"

remember there are nuclear
power plants storing waste

all over the country,
lots of it in so-called

"spent fuel pools."

That's where nuclear
fuel rods are supposed to be

temporarily placed to cool down,

and then put
into dry containers,

and then moved

to permanent
underground storage sites.

But remember,
we don't have one of those.

And in many places those pools
are just accumulating

more and more rods.

And while experts say
it's highly unlikely,

if a Fukushima-like accident
happens at one of those,

the results could be
catastrophic.

ANCHOR:
 The northeast has a number
 of nuclear power plants,

including the Indian Point plant
 just outside of New York City.

If any one of those
 were to have

a severe
 spent fuel pool accident,

you're taking away
 a lot of big cities,

a lot of farm lands,
 a lot of the United States,

for decades, perhaps centuries.

That's right,
lots of big cities.

New York, Hartford, Boston.

And that last one is
a real shame,

'cause as I understand it,
they only just got

un-racist yesterday.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-So...

I mean, at least they could get
to enjoy their new life.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-So...

So, look, it is pretty clear
we need to find

a permanent facility to store
our most dangerous waste.

And 30 years ago,
we actually settled on a site,

Yucca Mountain in Nevada.

Congress passed a law
designating it

as our sole candidate
for waste storage.

Now since then,
we've spent 15 billion dollars

prepping the site,

as you can see
from this rather upbeat video.

NARRATOR: Located
 about 100 miles

northwest of Las Vegas,

Yucca mountain is the most
 thoroughly researched site

of its kind in the world.

Experts throughout the world
 agree that the most

feasible and safe method

for disposing
of highly radioactive materials

is to store them
 deep underground.

That's right.
The best place

to put nuclear waste is
in a hole deep underground.

Much like Felicity.

Wait. Wait, if she's not there,
where is she?

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Ah, Jesus fucking Christ!

Fuck me!

Jesus! Fucking--
Get the fuck away!

(PANTING)

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

(PANTING)

-(AUDIENCE CHEERS)
-It's alright. It's okay.

I'm fine.

It's fine.

The point is...

So, Yucca mountain
is our permanent storage site.

So the problem is solved,
right? Well, no!

Because while the site
has been deemed safe,

and the people
in the immediate area,

Nye County,
actually support the project,

many Nevadans elsewhere
in the state

really don't want it.

And their former senator,
Harry Reed, lobbied hard,

eventually managing
to get Yucca shot down.

Now, to be fair, he did have
an alternative plan

for all the states sitting
on their nuclear waste,

but to put it mildly,

it was not exactly
scientifically-sound.

Leave it on site, where it is.

Leave it where it is,
and dry cast storage containers.

If you were smart,
what you would do is, uh...

leave this...

leave it where it is.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

"If you're smart,
what you would do is leave

the thing where it is"
is terrible advice

for dealing with nuclear waste.

Although, it is coincidentally

the title of Britain's
bestselling book on parenting.

-But... But...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Here... Here is the truth.

the scientific consensus
for decades

has been that leaving it where
it is is a really bad idea.

The shutted power plant
at San Onofre, in California,

is storing nuclear waste,
and it's on a fault line

right next to the ocean.

And that sounds like
something you learn

in the first scene of a movie
starring The Rock

that you watch on a plane.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-And look,

maybe Yucca is the best place

to store our growing supply
of radioactive garbage.

Maybe it's not.

I am not a nuclear scientist.
I just have the face of one.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-And... And our--

Our new energy secretary,
Rick Perry...

yes, Rick Perry...

has said that he is
optimistic about fixing

the whole problem,
which does sound great.

Although, he didn't exactly do
a great job

at dealing with this disaster.

♪ (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Yeah, that was him
on Dancing with the Stars,

and on the basis of that,
managing volatile energy

is not really his forte.

But here's the thing.
We've been saying

that we are going to fix this
for decades now,

and we seem to be no closer
to a solution.

And let me show you something

that really drove that fact
home to us,

because we've
been researching this story

for a couple of weeks now,
and just yesterday afternoon,

we stumbled on a TV special
from 1977,

the year that I was born.

♪ (MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

NARRATOR:
 NBC News presents...

Danger! Radioactive Waste.

Yeah, this problem is so old

they reported on it back when
the news was kept

in an America-shaped vault
that you had to open

with a crank.

As we watched that yesterday,
we gradually

and chillingly realized that
by pure coincidence

it hits every beat of the story
that we just told you.

It opens with footage
of sailors throwing barrels

into the ocean.

It looks at the facilities
at Hanford.

It talks about radiation's
impact on workers

and on families
who live nearby.

And while it doesn't have
a radioactive alligator,

it does have radioactive cows.

Which is-- which is still good.
Although,

I did prefer our alligator.

I liked it when he went...
(HISSES)

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-But--

But the most chilling moment

in that documentary might be
the one where they sit down

with someone in authority,
and demand to know

exactly when this will be fixed.

NARRATOR: When you ask
when the problem will be solved,

you get answers like this.

WOMAN: What's the realistic
time table?

Realistic time table
is scheduled to have

a repository in operation
by 1985,

with the selection of the sites
by the end of 1978

for detailed work.

Exactly.

Nuclear waste is a problem
we were supposed to have dealt

with in the 1980's
and still cannot solve,

much like this Rubik's Cube
that I always carry with me.

You are my Jean Valjean,
cube, and, one day,

-I shall defeat you.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

And at the end
of that special, remember,

40 years ago, the correspondent
delivers this special message.

The waste
increases every minute.

The solution of where
to put it is years away.

And none of the previous
 solutions has worked.

We are accustomed
 in this country to act

only in times of crisis.

But with nuclear waste,

when the crisis comes,
 it will be too late.

And that was
from four decades ago.

We have already waited way
too long to resolve this issue.

And we are dancing
with trouble here.

So if any one says
the government

can just continue to wait,

they are much like
a house with no toilet.

Absolutely full of shit.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS, APPLAUDS)

our mom is going tonight concerns breast

implants some are against them others

believe they're fine in rare cases and

many believe you should be able to get

them whenever the you want

sorry did I say breast implants I meant

abortions tonight's main topic concerns

abortions before before you change the

channel before you change the channel I

know this is a polarizing topic although

interestingly when the website Vox asked

people in the street for their opinions

the issue wasn't quite as binary as it's

usually presented if I had to pick I

would say that I'm pro-choice but

personally I'm more on a

somewhere in the middle I wouldn't but

arcade choose for other people I'm

pretty car pro-life I think when the

baby gets a heartbeat that should be the

cutoff point that's just my stance I'm

not the kind of guy like that I want

everyone to follow my stance okay well

not needing anyone to follow your stance

is a healthy attitude to abortion and

it's also a terrible attitude with which

to leave the Rockettes you do you

Bethany you do you girl you do you the

truth is people's opinions on abortion

make up a spectrum but most of us

believe it should be legal in at least a

few circumstances in fact only 19% of

Americans told Gallup they thought it

should be completely illegal and if you

are in that 90 percent you are frankly

excused from watching the rest of this

but but but do rejoin us at 11:29

because once I'm done talking about this

we'll all be watching a video featuring

a bucket of sloths and and I promise you

it is almost violently delightful but

but until that time the rest of us

really do need to talk about abortion

laws because wherever you are on this

spectrum whether you like me believe

that women should have the right to

choose or whether you believe abortion

should only be allowed in a few

circumstances then this story should

concern you and here is why since 2010

new state laws have contributed to the

closure of about 70 abortion clinics and

these four states are down to exactly

one abortion clinic each that's right

Mississippi now has four times as many

S's as it has abortion clinics and if

you're thinking how is that possible

well it's in no small part because the

key Supreme Court decision concerning

abortion is no longer Roe vs. Wade

it's the 1992 Planned Parenthood versus

Casey ruling that said states can create

restrictions as long as they don't place

an undue burden that places an a

substantial obstacle in the part of a

woman seeking an abortion meaning women

can be asked to jump through a few hoops

just not too many which might sound a

little less insulting if those weren't

also the rules for a dog agility course

and the vagueness of that ruling is

allowed states to introduce dozens of

what some have called trap laws or

targeted regulation of abortion

providers though their supporters to an

Erie degree all characterize them

somewhat differently this is really

about the issue of women's health we're

protecting women's health and safety we

are protecting women's health I just

wanted to reiterate that this is really

all about protecting the health and

safety of women yeah but when you're

that insistent about women's health it

starts to sound suspicious it's like

having a folder on your computer called

definitely not porn yeah you're not

fooling anyone you're asking more

questions than you're answering so so

let's take a look at what these laws

actually do for women's health

starting with Texas's hb2 which passed

in 2013 and had two key stipulations it

requires abortion clinics to meet the

same building standards as outpatient

surgical centers and requires their

doctors to have hospital admitting

privileges

okay now hospital admitting privileges

and high building standards sound great

until you realize what they actually

mean sort of how Moondance

sounds like a lovely night of romance

and whimsy but really means having sex

with Van Morrison and that's not what

you signed up for because the outpatient

surgical center requirements can be

difficult to fulfill as this Texas

clinic discovered explain again why it's

gonna be shut down because this isn't

wide enough yeah cuz right now the walls

that we have they're about three feet

wide and to being ASC it has to be eight

feet wide

now I'm not saying width isn't important

in fact in some circumstances it's far

more important than length is a thing

that I have hurt

penises I'm talking about penises but

that ain't thought requirement is wide

enough for two surgical Gurney's to pass

one another in a corridor which is just

not something that is likely to happen

at a small abortion clinic about 90% of

abortions occur in the first trimester

when they are generally non-surgical

procedures with no cutting and only mild

sedation they usually involve suction or

just taking medication neither of which

require a large surgical facility

you don't need an operating room to take

a pill which is a good thing because you

wouldn't want an entire surgical team

scrubbing in every time Larry King

needed a boner they'll get tired and and

as for Texas's law that doctors have

admitting privileges at a local hospital

a requirement 10 other states have also

passed that can shut a clinic down

because many hospitals for financial or

political reasons won't grant them to a

doctor who performs abortions and again

defenders of these laws will say they

have a simple purpose by requiring their

abortionists obtain admitting privileges

at local hospitals we are protecting

women's health yep but are you though

because it's worth noting both the AMA

and the American College of

Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have

argued there is simply no medical basis

for requiring local admitting privileges

which does make sense because hospitals

will see anyone they'll see you if

you've gotten an Elmo PEZ dispenser

stuck in your butt

they'll have questions for you but they

will see you they'll see you they'll

question you and later they may laugh at

you and while we are on the subject of

safety legal abortions have a mortality

rate of point zero zero zero seven three

percent that is nearly ten times less

than what one study found was the risk

for dying as the result of a colonoscopy

and let's agree by the way all of us

death by colonoscopy has to be one of

the worst ways to die right after having

your mother cachi masturbating and what

you're trying to pull your pants up you

fall and hit your head so your dad has

to carry your panceliss to the car to

take you to the hospital and the girl

next door you have a crush on tries to

help but she's laughing so hard at the

size of your penis that she closes the

door in your hand stopping your mother

who slams her foot on the gas dragon you

be

the car for several blocks while your

father yells your TV show is derivative

and you'll never escape the shadow of

John Stewart's

that's a general fear if admitting

privileges are so important for

continuity of care it is weird that you

don't need them in Texas to run a

birthing center even though one study

found that 12% of women admitted to

birthing centers wound up being

transferred to a hospital so Texas will

shut down an abortion clinic for having

walls too close together but if you want

to give birth in a tub surrounded by

mood lighting potpourri and the music of

Bon Iver no one will say anything other

than just take it down a notch and

proponents of these laws will point to a

few notorious cases like the clinic run

by Kermit Gosnell in Pennsylvania who

wound up being convicted of murder

although for the record his clinic had

not been inspected for 17 years which it

absolutely should have been they didn't

need new laws so much as they needed to

bother to enforce the ones they had

putting absurd new restrictions on all

clinics because of Kermit Gosnell is

like seeing that photo of a Taco Bell

employee licking the food and saying

okay all restaurants have to have

corridors that are eight feet wide

hold on that's gonna shut down most of

the restaurants in the country and

you've done nothing to address the root

problem here and some of these laws have

nothing whatsoever to do with clinic

safety like the ones that force doctors

like Willie Parker to actively spread

misinformation the state requires me to

cover some very basic information with

you first the state requires me to tell

you that if you're having an abortion

it's possible to having complications

there's a risk of bleeding there's a

risk of infection there's a risk of

damage to any of your organs but guess

what those are the exact same risk from

containing a pregnancy and going to turn

the final thing that I have to tell you

that I don't agree with but I have to

tell you in a way having an abortion can

increase your risk for breast cancer

there's not a shred of scientific

evidence to prove that they can require

me to tell you the first part but they

they can't stop me from giving you my

best medical opinion and that is that

there's no increased risk for breast

cancer from an abortion

it must be weird for a woman to witness

her medical professional forced to play

a game of good doctor bad doctor okay

time for your tetanus booster know those

cause autism well it's not a shred of

scientific evidence to prove that bad

doctor bad bad doctor in addition some

states have passed laws requiring

providers to show and describe an

ultrasound image whether a woman wants

to see that or not and when North

Carolina was defending such a law this

was how they attempted to soften that

the proposed law says if a woman wishes

not to see the ultrasound or hear the

fetal heartbeat she may cover her ears

and eyes and refuse to listen oh great

so North Carolina tried to give women

viewing ultrasounds the same option as

women trying to watch John Travolta's

performance in the new OJ Simpson show

oh my god oh my god what is he doing Oh

does he think Robert Shapiro was a sad

clown in Abbas Lerman movie I didn't

want to watch this why are you making me

and some other clinics enter into a

bureaucratic war as a result of these

laws take this clinic in Alabama it was

shut down after not being able to meet

the new building codes Alabama had

forced upon it but instead of giving up

the owner cashed in his retirement

savings to open a new facility that

complied completely with the law and

that is when Alabama started targeting

him directly I'm spared close to a

million dollars to meet all of their

requirements and you think you're done

and what are they trying to do they're

trying to pass another bill that said I

can't be in 2,000 feet of the school

they're treating me the patients the

physicians as sex offenders well they're

treating someone like a sex offender

when he clearly isn't one it's a move

that's now commonly known as I reverse

Cosby look

and look if you are thinking if you're

thinking the job look when a clinic

closes can't women just travel further

you should know there are now mandatory

waiting periods in 27 states some up to

72 hours between an initial consult and

an abortion so women can be forced to

either take multiple trips or plan the

shittiest three-day weekend imaginable

and if that's not possible they can end

up making desperate decisions listen to

one clinic administrator describe a call

from a patient's I told her you can come

to San Antonio we can help you here and

she said I can't I have I don't have the

means there's no way I can get to San

Antonio so what if I tell you what I

have in my kitchen cabinet and you tell

me what I could do I'll tell you what I

have in my kitchen cabinet and you can

tell me what I can do when your state's

abortion laws are forcing people into

the most depressing Quickfire challenge

in Top Chef history I think it's safe to

say they've gone too far because

here is the thing abortion cannot just

be theoretically legal it has to be

literally accessible and remember every

single one of us watching this right now

every every single one of us watching

right now agrees that it should be legal

at the very least in a few extreme

circumstances say hypothetically a young

girl has been the victim of sexual

assault well thanks to these laws this

hypothetical girl might have to travel a

long distance because there were no

clinics close to her and again thanks to

these laws the girl might be approaching

the point where her state won't let her

get the procedure at all well sadly none

of that is hypothetical and I'll let the

Texas clinic director tell you the rest

in order to see her I need to put her to

sleep and in order to do that I need a

nurse anesthetist and because this crazy

law it is impossible to find people to

work for us she's 13 years old and she

is a victim of rape and she drove four

hours from McAllen to San Antonio and we

had to turn her way and there was

nothing I could do to save her and so

now if she has a procedure that if is

huge

shoved all the way to New Mexico and pay

$5,000 and get there

and spend three days you don't never

happen we know about and at that point

we have sentenced a child to motherhood

now that specific provider whole woman's

health is actually at the center of a

Supreme Court case that will be heard

next month if it's a 4-4 tie the Texas

laws stand so the best hope is that

Justice Kennedy seen here in dog form

straightening his tie will see Texas

regulation as an undue burden this whole

situation is basically in his paws now

meanwhile Florida is drafting similar

trap laws and the law in Alabama that

would close that one clinic near a

school will be introduced to committee

later this week and if all this has made

you sad or angry then you should really

keep an eye on these laws and if you

don't have a problem with the current

situation then well it is 11:29 welcome

back

thanks for rejoining us 19% a quick

question what the is wrong with you

but but nothing up top know what putting

our size

I made I made a promise I promise

everyone sloths in a bucket and that is

what you are going to see although if

you are in that 19% I'm going to have to

insist that you cover your ears and eyes

and refuse to listen for everyone else

it is sloth apart you are very welcome

now I know I know this story has not

been the ideal way for anyone to go to

sleep on a Sunday night but but we

thought that this was something you

should really know about and the only

way that I can make it right is to give

you the absolutely ideal way to go to

sleep an actual sloth in a nightcap this

is thank you so much for watching the

show

with knives

Oh

Oh

yesterday marked the 50th anniversary of

the first Selma March one of the pivotal

moments which led to the Voting Rights

Acts but but voting rights in this

country much like John Travolta's hair

are still very much a work in progress

there are the obvious obstacles for many

Americans such as increasingly

restrictive voter ID laws but there's

also the less obvious ones as Congress

was reminded just this week as we

commemorate the 50th anniversary of the

march on Selma this week and the

subsequent passage of the Voting Rights

Act I want to once again call to the

attention my colleagues here in Congress

that there is still American citizens

today who do not have equal voting

rights these are citizens of Americans

island territories the US Virgin Islands

Puerto Rico Guam and the Northern

Marianas yes American citizens living in

u.s. island territories do not get to

vote for president that's the kind of

unsettling fact that deep down you

probably knew but chose not to think

about like the fact that the dog from

full house is definitely dead by now

you're proving my point

more than four million people live in

the US territories more than 98% of them

are racial or ethnic minorities and the

more you look into the history of why

their voting rights are restricted the

harder it is to justify because it goes

all the way back to an America first

acquired them the United States flag is

flying over these lands and so some

people said well doesn't that mean

American laws apply in 1901 the insular

cases basically the judgment of the

Supreme Court was that the new

territories were inhabited by quote

alien races and they may not be able to

understand anglo-saxon laws therefore

the Constitution doesn't have to apply

Wow

alien races can't understand anglo-saxon

principles I find that condescending and

I'm British

we basically invented patronizing

bigotry I do so wish we could explain

the concept of voting to them but during

me they're savage little coconut brains

would probably just collapse

I'm assuming it's coconut milk in there

will soon see wacky stick is not set off

some alarm bells for you the man who

wrote the lead decision in the first of

those rulings was justice Henry Billings

Brown who fun fact also wrote the famous

separate to put equal decision in Plessy

versus Ferguson and even he suggested

these exceptions to the Constitution

should only stand for a time as in a

temporary arrangement but it's been a

hundred and fourteen years it's like for

over a century America's computer has

been saying an update to your country is

available and we've been clicking

reminds me later again and again and

again so tonight let's look at voting

rights in the territories and we'll

begin in Puerto Rico whose citizens are

Americans a fact that comes as a

surprise to a shocking number of people

as we learned when Sonia Sotomayor was

named to the Supreme Court

Sotomayor a Bronx native is the daughter

of Puerto Rican immigrants she was a

first generation American the daughter

of Puerto Rican immigrants a daughter of

Puerto Rican immigrants she is the

daughter of Puerto Rican immigrants

she's the daughter of Puerto Rican

immigrants no she isn't she's the

daughter of Americans who moved from

Puerto Rico in Puerto Ricans are

immigrants anyone anywhere immigrant

broke could you help me immigrate

Apartments on Saturday I need to

immigrate a couch up two flights of

stairs Puerto Rico has more American

citizens than 21 US states but less

voting rights than any of them and

whether or not they choose to become a

state it's a little weird that while

they're making that decision they have a

delegate in Congress who can't do much

my constituents cherish their US

citizenship and have made countless

contributions to this country yet they

cannot vote for president have no US

senators and send one delegate to the

house who has a voice but no vote in

this chamber it's funny infantilizing

when discussing national legislation to

give Puerto Rico the same status as a

six year old voting on where the family

should get to go on vacation

oh what's that Timmy Narnia okay

Colonial Williamsburg it is there and

that you were heard Timmy you were heard

and the same voting rights restrictions

apply to the residents of Guam the

Pacific territory that unequivocally

sounds the most like a Batman punch

[Applause]

[Music]

there is there is nothing not to love

about Guam it is a beautiful island in a

strategically important location for the

US military

so much so their bases currently occupy

over a quarter of Guam's land and yet

the residents of Guam have absolutely no

say in general elections for their

commander in chief which is even harder

to swallow when you consider this

according to guan's Office of Veterans

Affairs at least one in eight adult

Guamanians is a veteran among the

highest percentages of all US states and

territories Guam gives a quarter of its

land and as much as an eighth of its

people to the US military at this point

the American flag should really just be

a guy from Guam waving an American flag

and yet due in part to their lack of

full voting rights those veterans are

shamefully underserved in 2012 Guam

ranked dead last in per-capita spending

on medical care by the US Department of

Veterans Affairs or the VA it's called

the PTSD program look here so it tells

me you to enter my address five options

here but the closest one so far looks

like Hawaii it's three thousand eight

hundred three miles point twenty two

miles that is disgusting the only person

who should have to travel 3,800 miles

for treatment should be a Beverly Hills

housewife flying to Colombia for

unapproved lip injections derived from

cobra venom but but the amazing thing is

just because Guam residents aren't

allowed to vote for president doesn't

mean that they don't go on hold a straw

poll every presidential election and

they're registered voter turnout is

actually higher than that of the rest of

America

and to misquote the words of the great

philosopher Lil Jon turn out for what

that's a great song but just just

imagine how it must feel to have the

desire to vote but know deep down you're

going to be ignored actually you don't

have to imagine it because let this

Gwang voter tell you it's terrible I

mean I I believe it's not fair you know

we're all citizens of the United States

I wish somebody change that okay that

sounds sad but at least on Election Day

that woman gets to wear the incredibly

special I voted and wish it had actually

counted sticker but amazingly Guam still

gets more respect from the US government

than American Samoa as was proven a

little while back when a u.s. member of

Congress was tasked with introducing

their delegates inai Faleomavaega the

chair recognizes the gentleman from

American Samoa mr. king hello and Binga

somolia listen I get his name is a

little difficult but you cannot

mispronounce American Samoa there's a

Girl Scout cookie like the state of thin

mint asipi that would be ridiculous but

watch how gracious Americans Somalia's

delegate was in his response Thank You

mr. speaker to American Samoa

that is class that I do not have because

if I were him I'd responded thank you it

is a privilege to be here in Waffle

tandino great United sporks of Eluga

boink

American Samoans not only lack voting

rights they lack a little something

extra to the US Constitution grants the

citizenship to everyone born on US soil

except in one jurisdiction American

Samoa

in the South Pacific it is a u.s.

territory but people who are born there

do not automatically get US citizenship

I think don't even get automatic

citizenship meaning the American part of

American Samoa is really just a title

that doesn't mean anything like People's

Choice Award nominee or social media

experts just devoid of meaning and that

fact is especially shocking when you

learned that American Samoa a territory

that cannot vote for a president who

could send it to war is also home to the

top Army recruiting station in the

country so now I'm thinking the American

flag should be a dye from American Samoa

waving a flag with a guy from Guam on it

waving the American flag and because of

their status as non-citizens many

veterans have to carry around a

humiliating reminder that they are not

equal in the eyes of the law so this

here is my US national passport the very

last page of the passport makes it

uniquely a US national passport and

makes me look like I'm an outsider I

think it did me if that means me as a

person I think that's right they're not

citizens but Nationals which means they

can't run for president serve on a

federal jewelry or depending on where

they live even become a public

schoolteacher so that they're kind of

like off-brand citizens they're they're

Americans in the same way that these are

fruit loops or this is dr. pepper you

could pretend is the same thing everyone

knows it's worse five American Samoans

are actually suing the government to

change this rule but the Obama

administration has fought them by citing

the insular cases from earlier which

suggest that American Samoans like all

residents of the territories can be

given fewer rights because they belong

to alien races differing from us in

customs and modes of thought and that's

a tricky argument to win in the face of

this kind of evidence where you from I'm

originally from American Samoa and what

do you do for a living I'm a soldier in

the US Army

I joined straight out of high school and

it was something to serve my country and

to give back I'm active service we just

got back from deployment to Afghanistan

for nine months all the way

[Music]

[Applause]

just to be clear that is an Afghanistan

war veteran moving an audience to cheers

and at least one judge to a partial

orgasm with a rendition of a Rihanna

song on a show called America's Got

Talent

if that's not American I don't think one

has ever existed of complicated issues

surrounding what the precise status of

all the US territories should be and

what the people who live there would

prefer but surely when it comes to

denying Americans the right to vote we

have to find a better reason than citing

a 100 year old legal decision written by

a racist that was always supposed to be

temporary and I'm not saying this will

be an easy thing to do I'm just saying

we've figured out a lot more complicated

things in the last hundred and fourteen

years think about it

we invented television we eliminated the

measles and then for some reason

brought them back again WrestleManias

and those things are logistical

nightmares and you know what else we

figured out how to fly and if we

can work out how to climb inside metal

Birds slip the bonds of this earth and

soar through the air to visit these

territories we should be able to work

out how to ensure the four million

people who live there get adequately

hurt

you

[Music]

Donald Trump the only president who

combines the sordid extramarital affairs

of a young JFK with the dead-eyed

puffiness of a post-watergate Richard

Nixon look I know we have talked about

Trump a lot on this show but tonight

we'd like to do it from a slightly

different angle and that is focusing on

his relationship with the world because

while we were away you may remember one

particular remark he made according to

the US president Africa is a shithole

that's right he said that he absolutely

said that except to be fair to him it's

actually worse because he reportedly

called Africa Haiti and El Salvador

holes which is just not okay and I do

acknowledge that I personally have

called Belgium a shithole multiple times

but in my defense a I'm not president

and be Belgium is a load some chocolate

gulag with no objective reason to exist

so you can see that it's very different

you can see that and look you probably

saw people on u.s. TV being justifiably

appalled by those remarks but what you

may not have seen is the response from

the countries he insulted honestly so

sure then she's like has he ever

we not sit home we people we just like

it is a yes because it doesn't

matter what you have he's still going to

the same hole we're the same worms will

eat into Wow

you know it says something about the

Trump era that the phrase the same worms

will eat into actually qualifies as a

hopeful thought I would honestly like

that crocheted on a pillow so I can wake

up to it every morning and look look it

is not like that's the only time that

Trump's remarks have caused an

international uproar he said that Korea

used to be part of China which outraged

South Koreans he claimed that Germany

owes NATO vast sums of money which it

does not and in the UK he retweeted

these anti-muslim videos from a

far-right British group which triggered

massive condemnation and instead of

fully apologizing for it he said it was

a big story where you are but it was not

a big story where I am and that is

exactly his attitude if it wasn't big

where I could see it then it wasn't big

so forget mastering foreign affairs

Trump may not have mastered object

permanence which you really need to be a

good president or even a good

baby and yet here is the crucial thing

the rest of the world continues to exist

whether Trump acknowledges or not so

tonight let's try and answer a few basic

questions at first what is Donald

Trump's foreign policy because it seems

to be little more than repeating a

single phrase America first America

first America first again America first

America first it will be America first

from now on

America first now if you are another

country watching that you may well be

wondering wait

when has America's attitude ever not

been America first they've been putting

America first since the day they arrived

in America very much second but say here

Donald Trump telling in recent years

we've been getting the short end of the

stick on the campaign trail he often

complained that America had become a

global punch line and promised that he

could reverse that the world is laughing

at us folks the whole world is laughing

at us they're laughing at this that's

what's going on in our country the world

laughs at us folks the world laughs at

us we're not gonna be a laughingstock

like we have been and we have been

believe me oh we're not going to be a

laughingstock anymore huh it is insane

that Trump this guy this guy this guy

thought he would end the laughter it's

like a flamingo in boxer shorts named

Phineas J rocket dump ran for president

under the slogan time to get serious now

for the record since Trump became

president if anything the world is

laughing harder than ever before because

while all US presidents do get made fun

of impersonating Trump has become an

international cottage industry Israel

has Trump kicking a Muslim man while

dancing lewdly to guns and roses Germany

has him dancing to Uptown funk

Spain has him flipping off the world and

again dancing like an idiot and there's

more here he is in Pakistan here he is

in Bulgaria here he is in Taiwan

here he is in Ethiopia here's a pretty

shitty one from Turkey where they're not

even trying

here's a Korean Trump and here's one

from an Italian comedy show see him born

in the USA on a stealth fighter before

being taken out with a bucket on his

head

are any of these funny I don't know is

anything about trunk funny anymore

somehow the world's most objectively

laughable human has become a comedy

graveyard when laughter goes to die and

in case you think any of that may have

been good-natured ribbing a recent

Gallup poll shows that the world's

approval rating of US leadership has

dropped to 30 percent after being at

nearly 50 percent just two years ago

that is a precipitous drop in popularity

is the equivalent of replacing gal gadot

in the Wonderwoman franchise with Matt

Lauer look I know I love the Donald

Trump and others may not give a

about what the world thinks about us but

they really should for a number of

reasons chief among them something

called soft power which yes I

acknowledge does sound like an erectile

dysfunction medication for chinchillas

so soft yet so hard but but basically

basically refers to the ability to get

others to do what you want them to do

without using carrots or sticks it's

kind of a country's brand and a nation

soft power can come from many sources

from your pop culture to the ideals you

express to your reputation and diplomacy

can play a major part in it even hard

power practitioners like Trump's own

Secretary of Defense Jim Mad Dog mattis

supports the soft power work that's done

by the State Department that is why a

few years back he gave a full-throated

defense of properly funding it frankly

they need to be as as fully funded as

Congress believes appropriate because if

you don't fund the State Department

fully then I need to buy more ammunition

ultimately now that is scary because buy

more ammunition is his way of saying

without diplomacy there will be more

Wars

he doesn't need more ammunition so he

can make more bullets earrings for his

Etsy store because he's not just

Secretary of Defense he also crafts

accessories for the elegant weirdo now

unfortunately though Trump has shown

little interest in soft power his

administration recently proposed a 29

percent cut to the State Department and

foreign aid and there are

any high-level vacancies at the State

Department to say nothing of our lack of

ambassador's from Belgium to Belize

South Korea to South Africa President

Trump has a problem

his embassies have no ambassador Turkey

Jordan Egypt Qatar and Saudi Arabia all

without ambassadors holy

South Korea Turkey and Saudi Arabia

those are countries where you really

need an ambassador it's not like Lipson

Stein where you can basically scrape by

with a sign that says never stop

Lichtenstein II and as for the

ambassadors that Trump has appointed

some of them are frankly not grapes when

Trump appointed Peter Hoekstra

ambassador to the Netherlands they were

a little upset over there as this

interview shows speaking of threat at

one point you mentioned in a debate that

there are no go zones in the Netherlands

and that cars and politicians are being

set on fire and then I didn't say that

that is actually an incorrect statement

yeah we would call it fake news okay

okay I didn't say that so and so he's

given himself some wiggle room there as

long as he didn't say exactly what the

reporter just claimed about no-go zones

and politicians being set on fire he's

technically correct the only thing in

the whole world

that would make him not correct is if

say video of him saying that cars and

politicians are being bird and that yes

there are no go zones in the Netherlands

there are cars being burned there are

politicians that are being burned and

yes there are no go zones in the

Netherlands it's pretty weird not to

recall saying out loud there are

politicians that are being burned in the

Netherlands it's not the kind of thing

that you do and immediately forget about

like driving to work or seeing the movie

the post I mean I have a vague memory of

walking into a darkened room eating Milk

Duds and thinking Meryl Streep is a

treasure but the rest is a complete

blank

but when Trump was asked about his

understaffed State Department he claimed

that it didn't really matter for one key

reason let me tell you the one that

matters is me I'm the only one that

matters because when it comes to it

that's what the policy is going to be

I'm the only one that matters the only

one that matters is me it's hard to tell

if Donald Trump is laying out a

diplomatic strategy or demanding that

daddy buy him an oompa loompa then his

actions are critical to our nation's

foreign policy and that brings us to our

next question how is his approach to the

world going and the answer surprisingly

is great and now this I'm kidding it's

been a disaster

in fact to give you a sense of how much

damage he can do in very little I can't

believe you nearly bought that he could

do a very little time just look at last

summer's back-to-back NATO and g7 summit

it was just three days of meetings in

which time he reportedly told European

leaders that quote the Germans are bad

very bad then shook Emmanuel krons hands

so aggressively it seemed like he was

trying to masturbate an elephants then

at the g7 conference the next day world

leaders unsuccessfully tried to convince

him to stay in the Paris climate Accord

and in the middle of all of that he gave

a speech where he failed to explicitly

reaffirm article 5 the basic principle

that NATO members should come to the aid

of each other when attacked affirming it

is routine for presidents and it was

even in Trump speech until being

apparently deleted at the very last

minute blindsiding top members of his

own national security team and after

witnessing Trump's erratic behavior for

just three days Angela Merkel was so

shell-shocked

she made this statement the times when

we could completely rely on others are

to an extent / I've experienced this in

the last few days and that's why we

Europeans must really take our fate into

our own hands that was the day after the

summit

I wasn't even supposed to give a major

speech that was at a campaign event held

in a beer tent and that means we're

probably lucky there was an event of any

kind otherwise she would have just

yelled out Europe is on its own at her

nephew's piano recital and this brings

us to our final question what are the

consequences of this well one big one of

them could be that there is a leadership

vacuum in the world so who will fill

that well in Europe the obvious

candidate is Germany but even they know

that there may be an issue with that

well whenever I talk to people in our

neighbor countries they mostly expected

sort of the leadership of Germany but on

the other side whenever I talk to the

people in these countries with a very

good memory what happened in the first

half of the 20th century they are very

reluctant talking about a German

leadership you're right you're right I'm

so glad that you brought that up because

I I didn't want to be the first one to

bring it up but you are absolutely right

when people hear Germany wants to take a

leading role in Europe most of us do

still think no they're still in timeout

and they know why they know what they

did not see Germany now now globally it

seems that China is set to be the

biggest beneficiary because they have

been aggressively seeking to increase

their influence and soft power something

that has not gone unnoticed a nation

head of government recently explained to

me that at every regional conference

Washington sends a couple of diplomats

whereas Beijing sends dozens the Chinese

are there at every committee meeting and

you are not he said the result he

explained is that Beijing is

increasingly setting the Asian agenda

it's true the u.s. is absent at many

important meetings and that doesn't even

include meetings that Jared Kushner was

supposed to attend but he couldn't find

a room and he was too shy to ask someone

and then he realized it was too late

anyway so he just killed an hour

wandering around the lobby pretending to

be on the phone

and the piglets China's increased

influence should be alarming because

they are an autocratic country you don't

necessarily want China setting global

priorities on things like human rights

and democracy and yet

Trump's reckless behavior is opening the

door to exactly that happening not to

mention the fact that what he's doing is

going to make it harder for him to

accomplish his own goals he wants to

contain North Korea or to do that you

might want to appoint an ambassador to

South Korea he wants Germany to spend

more on its military okay but maybe stop

publicly shaming Merkel if you want her

to be able to sell that idea back home

and it wants to contain security threats

like Isis and Al Shabaab in African

countries then maybe don't call African

countries shitholes truck can

say that he doesn't care because his

approach is America first but you need

allies to get anything done

foreign affairs is like sex if you

loudly announce that you will always

come first

you're going to have trouble finding

partners and as for on to other promise

that the world will stop laughing it is

not just comedians doing that it's world

leaders Australian Prime Minister

Malcolm Turnbull was a depressed in the

last year and he had himself a bit of

fun Donald I we are we and we

face pulse they're the ones we're not.we

we're waiting in the real balls get out

of the online bones

they also guy

that is a key ally using the fact that

our president is a pathological liar as

a punchline and crushing that room like

a fourth grader with a carrot stick

stuck up his nose anything think that

was grim let me show you one more clip

we found when we were looking for Trump

impersonators around the world this one

is from Russian TV with a comedian

making fun of Trump's suspiciously close

relationship to Putin and there is a fun

little surprise for you

just at the end Hillary the other day

Hillary asked me Donald do you love

Russia I answered yes I do I love Russia

but you have no evidence against me

by God that is as happy as I've ever

seen Putin ever I guess at least we now

know what type of humor that Putin likes

he likes the kind where he medals in

another country's election succeeds has

a joke about it made to his face in

public and then realizes it all worked

out no one can touch him that's the kind

of humor that Putin likes it just

creases him up look I know that all of

this is depressing because it seems like

America's reputation overseas is under

attack from its own president which is

just ridiculous soft power is an act of

salesmanship it's selling your brand it

is the one thing that Trump is supposed

to be good at and he's blowing

it

so as an immigrant who has fallen in

love with this country for what it's

worth please allow me to speak to the

rest of the world in America's defense

for a moment because Donald Trump does

not reflect America I mean to be to be

completely honest to be completely

honest who does reflect it a bit but the

point is America is not one thing it's a

beautiful mess of contradictions where

good and bad are mixed together on one

hand it makes Mountain Dew which tastes

like a honeydew melon was by a

radioactive cloud on the other hand it

also made this awesome bed shaped like

the Batmobile you can fall asleep in

that thing and be Batman if Batman

somehow got locked out of the Batcave

and had to sleep in his car but that's

the American dream right there America

is the country that came up with YouTube

which yes I know gave you in the world

that head Logan Paul but it also

gave you those videos of adults in t-rex

suits on dirt bikes ballet dancing

exercising and doing basic car repairs

and by the way that magnificent dinosaur

costume that's an American idea to that

the point is America is the country that

gave you Star Wars

you're welcome and Scientology who were

sorry about that and and sometimes

what's great and terrible about us is

just impossible to separate like look

Popeyes Chicken

it's objectively disgusting but I would

run across traffic to eat this but

the point is trevor is the worst of us

yes but he's not all of us if I did is

still America down to one sound it

wouldn't be the braying voice of Donald

Trump screaming America first it would

be the gorgeous voices of the New York

City gay men's chorus singing this song

[Applause]

that's right that's all star by

smashmouth a terrible stupid songs being

sung absolutely beautifully this should

be our new national anthem and so please

world

[Applause]

[Music]

embarrassment the country to incredible

dinosaur costumes

[Applause]

infrastructure it's our roads bridges

dams levees airports power grids

basically anything that can be destroyed

in an action movie

[Applause]

[Applause]

we if an alien species judged

humanity by our most popular movies

they'd think we were furious with

asphalt all the time the problem is

though when our infrastructure is not

being destroyed by robots and or saved

by Bruce Willis we tend to find it a bit

boring as you know infrastructure is not

a sexy or glamorous topic as much as I'd

like to think otherwise infrastructure

is not sexy infrastructure is not very

sexy

yes infrastructure like those men we

just heard from is important but not

sexy although to be fair that may just

be because Hollywood promotes

unrealistic standards of infrastructure

beauty that's not what a real Road looks

like real roads had curves so most most

people think infrastructure for I think

it's boring but but is it because I'd

argue that it's actually pretty

fascinating and I know that in saying

that I've basically become the rad youth

counselor trying to convince you that

Jesus was the Taylor Swift of his time

revelations is a breakup song to the

Romans guys who want another Mountain

Dew catch so let's talk about

infrastructure tonight and let's begin

with dams because dams are amazing

they're the most powerful device we have

for holding back liquid aside from the

idea of using a porta potti oh wait I'll

just wait forever

I cannot go in there America used to

love dams Grand Coulee Dam in Washington

State

biggest concrete structure Boulder Dam

stands today a modern Colossus the walls

of the new dam tower into the sky like

mighty modern pyramid yes and we built

those dams with ingenuity and brawn and

of course piles and piles of dead Irish

that of course we did they're good

workers and their corpses make a solid

foundation material that's an

architectural fact but these days

America's wants great dam system is in a

state of serious disrepair the average

age of the country's 84,000 dams is 52

years and many of them have problems

that stem from when they were first

built yes much like most Botox

recipients and competitive cloggers the

average Dam is 52 years old and probably

has something deeply broken inside of it

you would think a statistic like that

would terrify people into action but

amazingly many states are paying

virtually no attention to their dam

problems in 2007 the last year for which

statistics are available Texas had just

seven inspectors responsible for seventy

four hundred dams that's over 1,050 dams

per inspector the state was only able to

look at 239 dams Alabama doesn't even

have an Inspection Agency to monitor its

2,000 plus dams zero inspectors that

means that the state of Alabama has

exactly the same number of damaged

Spector's as the banned Alabama and it's

not just dams we're currently doing a

terrible job of maintaining all of our

infrastructure the nation's

infrastructure and bridges roads and

pipelines is sorely in need of

renovation collectively they get nothing

more than a d+ a d+ think about that

America got the same grade that a 10th

grade teacher gives a nightmare kid so

she doesn't have to deal with him for

another year

no no London we're not calculating the

surface area of our penises just give

him a d+ and say has family troubles I

cannot even deal with that again

and look to be fair that deep last grade

came from the American Society of Civil

Engineers who would clearly benefit from

more infrastructure spending so it's a

bit like having the state of our

nation's tennis ball assessed by the

American Society of golden retrievers

they're dangerously underthrown this

must change we've been such good dogs

such good dogs but other studies have

also found our infrastructure is lacking

the World Economic Forum ranks America's

16th in the world and we need to be

better because when infrastructure fails

bad things happen like last year when a

pipe burst and flooded the campus of

UCLA a water main break in West Los

Angeles turned the UCLA campus into a

river students walked through ankle-deep

water or in some cases tried to have fun

with the situation I've been chilling

here for 20 minutes trying to get the

best view yeah I actually just came from

the gym it's like I've never seen so

much water except for like lakes I got

[Applause]

it's not just incredibly expensive

it can also be lethal from the big stuff

like bridge collapses and dam failures

to the little stuff like potholes gone

at 53 years old al Li slammed his bike

into a pothole riding along Grizzly Peak

Boulevard in Oakland his wife Nancy says

a car then hit him head-on roads need to

be paved that's why we have

infrastructure that's why we pay our

taxes that's horrifying but the problem

is we only ever seem to talk about

infrastructure when something tragic

like that happens and the scale of this

problem is scary as the former Secretary

of Transportation points out according

to the government there's 70,000 bridges

that hadn't been deemed structurally

deficient yeah what does that mean it

means that their bridges that need to be

really either replaced or repaired in a

very dramatic way

they're dangerous I don't want to say

they're unsafe but they're dangerous

hold on when we're at a point where the

Secretary of Transportation is

struggling to decide between using the

word unsafe and the word dangerous we

might have a problem worth fixing and if

you want a glimpse into how close to

catastrophe we occasionally are take

this story from Philadelphia in 2008 two

contractors from the Pennsylvania

Department of Transportation stopped to

get a sausage sandwich and park their

cars under this bridge

unfortunately they wanted that sausage

sandwich because they saw one of these

piers with an eight-foot gash in it

about five inches wide and if they had

mortar the sausage sandwich there's a

strong likelihood that bridge would have

collapsed so there might have been a

disaster if those Philly contractors

hadn't wanted to stop for a sausage

sandwich which means we were fine we

were always going to be fine

but but but the scary thing is the scary

thing is what if the next crack pillow

in Philadelphia is next to a vegan

smoothie stand that bridge is going down

and people are going to die and it's not

just Philadelphia look at Pittsburgh the

city of bridges and its solution to one

that was dangerously deteriorating one

of these arch bridges actually has a

structure built under it to catch

falling deck see that structure

underneath it they actually built that

to catch in in the falling concrete so

wouldn't hurt traffic underneath it they

built a bridge under the bridge that is

a college sophomore approach to

structural engineering where the trash

was overflowing so I just started

putting it in the microwave problem

solved

I'm a legend and there are dangerous

bridges everywhere here in New York the

Tappan Zee Bridge is so notoriously

shaky one government official in charge

of fixing it cause it's a hold your

breath bridge and the only time we

should ever talk about hold your breath

bridges would be if for some reason beau

bridges were into auto-erotic

asphyxiation and you were trying to

remember which one he was is either

normal bridges or is he the hold your

breath bridges

it's important that I know this the

facts about the Tappan Zee Bridge are

frightening enough and yet the History

Channel felt the need to produce a

terrifyingly cgi filled account of the

worst case scenario some of the Tappan

Zee sound ations

are at risk and this is what could

happen if they eventually gave way

okay one one that's very frightening but

two why did the director assume we'd all

had such a strong emotional attachment

to the coffee cup King Bridge just

collapsed at this point we aren't just

flirting with disaster we're rounding

third base and asking if disaster has

any condoms and the crazy thing is ask

any politician from either side and

they'll tell you that infrastructure is

incredibly important everyone agrees on

this in fact at a recent hearing both

business and labor in the form of the US

Chamber of Commerce and the afl-cio

turned out to support infrastructure

spending and even they know how rare

that is if business and labor can come

before you United on this issue and we

are united on this issue despite our

sharp disagreements on a variety of

other matters I think that should tell

everybody something and tell them very

loudly he's right the last time business

and labor agreed on an issue it was the

issue of how dead should Jimmy Hoffa be

they both agreed pretty dead hey here's

how obvious our need is just two days

ago even a total idiot agreed we have to

rebuild our infrastructure crumbling

everything's crumbling and we're

rebuilding China okay now what's the

labor whatever the he was talking about

regarding rebuilding China that

upside-down piece of candy corn in a wig

made of use medical gauze is right we do

have to rebuild our infrastructure so

with consensus like this how are things

so bad well one of the problems is just

fixing things is not politically

appealing because when you build

something new you get to do this

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

there is nothing politicians like more

than using oversized scissors to cut

through ribbons but you don't get to cut

a ribbon after routine repairs

infrastructure is like Legos building is

fun destroying is fun but a Lego

maintenance set would be the most boring

toy in the world it comes built

and then you maintain it and if you do

it right nothing happens and eventually

you die have fun son perhaps the best

symbol for our neglected infrastructure

is the US Highway Trust Fund it is the

single largest source of infrastructure

funding in this country and guess what's

about to happen to it there's a May 31st

deadline this year the Highway Trust

Fund goes bankrupt unless Congress acts

yeah the fund is about to run out of

money and unlike most broke trust fund

recipients our highway system can't just

get a job at its daddy's Law Firm really

Declan what case are you working on and

does it contain 24 Miller lights I hate

you Declan the reason the fund is nearly

insolvent is that it's primarily funded

by the federal gas tax and there's just

one hitch with that the Highway Trust

Fund gets revenue from an eighteen point

four cent per gallon gas tax but the tax

has not increased to keep up with

inflation since 1993 and the fact that

it hasn't increased means that in real

terms the gas tax has gone down 39%

since 1993 much like Koosh ball sales or

respect for Bill Cosby

I'd like to think it was more than that

but sadly I don't think it is actually

you would think that Congress would fix

this shortfall but we haven't had

long-term transportation legislation for

over a decade

in fact since 2003 it's barely passed

two partial authorizations and 23

short-term extensions one of which in

July 2005 was for just two days two days

that entire extension lasted half a

sting orgasm that's not enough so so you

might think why doesn't Washington just

raise the gas tax and fund the fund well

because that would be incredibly

unpopular listen to what happened when

c-span had a call in and asked people

whether or not the gas tax should be

raised

I don't know that another gas tax is

gonna help us out okay no they shouldn't

raise the gas gauge okay the last thing

we need is new taxes okay if gas prices

go back up we'll be stuck with the super

high prices okay what I want to say is

no war on coal war on gasoline war on

diesel I agree with all of the other

previous callers okay okay that calling

lasted for nearly an hour and they did

not receive a single call in favor of

the gas tax you would think they'd at

least have been prank calls by Mikey in

the Badger dc's number one morning zoo

crew hi I just like to say we should

definitely raise the gas tax

you've been badgered

[Applause]

[Music]

face in the face of that kinda

overwhelming lack of public support it

is hardly surprising that the White

House is not too keen on it either

the administration has not put forward

and does not plan to put forward a

proposal to increase the gas tax okay so

it seems raising the gas tax is unlikely

which is fine as long as you have

another concrete way to raise that money

so what is the White House's plan this

administration has put forward an idea

by essentially you know closing a

loophole that allows corporations to

benefit from stashing some of their

profits overseas okay raise funds by

closing corporate loopholes I think we

all know that is guaranteed to work

the only obstacle would be and I know

that this is highly unlikely if there

were another corporate loophole

somewhere else in the tax code oh oh and

there is one other obstacle when the

president floated this plan by John

Boehner a year ago he swatted it aside

perhaps because Boehner favors his own

plan which he's been talking up for the

past two years I'm committed to working

a defined a funding source so that we

can begin to repair America's aging

infrastructure The Hunt has been

underway for the last year and a half to

find out funding source which I could

report to you we found it but we haven't

we've got to find a way to deal with

America's a crumbling infrastructure and

we do need to do it in a long-term

program that that is in fact funded two

years and nothing that is but an oddly

laid back way to tackle a potentially

catastrophic problem because if a giant

lizard we're attacking our roads and

bridges you wouldn't spend two years

saying yes I am committed to preventing

marauding lizards destroying our city

but we need to do it in a long-term

program that is in fact funded I refuse

to believe that after all this time

Boehner does not have some sort of plan

we actually emailed his office earlier

this week and asked what is Speaker

Boehner's proposal to raise revenue for

the US Highway Trust Fund we didn't hear

back

so we emailed someone else in the office

still nothing so we

call to the office still nothing at this

point we were getting desperate so we

sent in this tweet asking mr. speaker

how specifically will you raise revenue

for the US Highway Trust Fund hashtag

happy birthday Justin Bieber just to

make sure that he would see it for

definite still nothing then we found out

that he's on vine for some reason

because apparently he's 14 in 2013 so we

sent him this mr. speaker how

specifically would you raise revenue for

the US Highway Trust Fund is that six

seconds it feels like I'd be a lot

longer nothing he still didn't get back

to us look the lack of political urgency

in tackling this problem is insane and

you cannot tell me that you are not

interested in this because every summer

people flock to see our infrastructure

threatened by terrorists or aliens but

we should care just as much when it's

under threats from the inevitable

passage of time the problem is no one

has made a blockbuster movie about the

importance of routine maintenance and

repair or they hadn't until now we're a

few feet of concrete can mean the

difference between life and death where

everything you love can be taken from

you in the blink of an eye a few brave

souls are willing to risk everything to

make nothing happen it's time for your

biennial bridge inspection I've got

Thursday afternoon or Friday anytime

before 3:00 this summer get ready for

infrastructure brace yourself for 98

heart-pounding minutes of incremental

maintenance I'm not showing any cracking

note the lamination dose falls on the

concrete deck that you got mild

corrosion on feet you're gonna have to

keep an eye on that thank you sir

don't get cocky the New York Times calls

infrastructure necessary and something I

never thought about but yeah sure

Jesus Scott Bobby behind you sickness

this thing is gonna blow

fifteen or twenty years which is farts

so important that we caught it early

[Music]

in this line of work one mistake could

be catastrophic it's loose boss bolt is

loose well then tighten it god dammit I

don't know which one

okay listen to me listen to me listen

lefty-loosey righty-tighty

[Applause]

[Music]

talk to me what's going on

it's good

[Applause]

holy stone says nothing happens and

that's probably for the best

I came here to chew bubblegum and

inspect bridges

you want to see terrible puns about

engineering you don't fully understand

looks like somebody needs to get their

ducks in a row you want to see 20 minute

monologues on the structural integrity

of girders I'm ordering uniaxial test to

the slab transverse to the deck

corrugations with additional

reinforcement and tension tests of the

support fastener connections between the

deck and the girders bitch routine

maintenance that you can handle they use

PVC piping when they should have used

see PVC piping

god help us you want to see

infrastructure

featuring an all-star cast plus two-time

Academy Award nominee Edward Norton

sorry three-time Academy Award nominee

Edward Norton

and introducing as the chief steve

buscemi I'm the best damn inspector in

the business and I'm here to inspect us

dam infrastructure if anything exciting

happens we've done it wrong sausage

sandwich of course

you

progress it's the reason that your

grandparents views are better not spoken

in public oh why did I bring you to

Straight Outta Compton pop up this is

this is partly on me in the recent

Republican presidential debate there was

a genuinely encouraging sign because the

subject of gay marriage came up and

presidential candidate John Kasich

responded like this guess what I just

went to a wedding of a friend of mine

who happens to be gay because somebody

doesn't think the way I do doesn't mean

that I can't care about him or I can't

love them Wow

a gay wedding just got applause at a

Republican debate add that to the list

of things that would have been

unthinkable in 2004 like the phrase

Academy Award winner Matthew McConaughey

would have said you were insane and it's

not just Kasich Jeb Bush Rick Perry

Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio have all

said they would attend a gay wedding if

invited which I can only imagine is

terrible news for any of their gay

acquaintances who invited them only on

the assumption that they were declined

to attend and send a very expensive gift

instead well I didn't think he would say

yes did I mark now now which of your

friends wants to sit with Bobby Jindal

yes your friends are like my friends

although not all of the candidates have

been quite so clear Governor Scott

Walker for instance had a much more

squirrelly response would you attend a

gay wedding well in terms of that's a

certainly a first place for a family

member taught by our family are we got a

family member who's had a reception I've

been at a wedding but one

marriages still is defined between a man

the woman I support the Constitution the

state but for someone I love we've been

at reception what it's a yes or no

question how the hell did you respond on

the RSVP card when it asked if you

wanted chicken or fish well that's

certainly a personal question for dinner

at Annette and I already had chicken it

was at a restaurant not our home last

week I believe I haven't had fish

recently though I said I still believe

it is certainly a meal which is my

position although according to the menu

there is also maybe a vegetarian option

so to answer your question I have eaten

chicken in the past yes well well the

idea of a gay wedding is increasingly

widely accepted it is worth noting that

there are still a number of surprising

ways to ruin a gay honeymoon today in

most states an LGBT person can get

married on Saturday

posts photos of their wedding on Sunday

and they get fired from their job or

thrown out at their apartment on Monday

just because of who they are okay that's

clearly terrible

the only possible reason you should be

fired from your job after your wedding

is if your theme was stolen office

supplies that's the only logical reason

but it is true that discriminating

against gay people is surprisingly legal

in much of the country the fact is in 31

States people are at risk of being fired

evicted or refused service just because

they're gay so while federal law may

guarantee a gay couple's right to get

married it offers exactly zero

guarantees about their rights to do the

things that normally follow that like

signing a lease on an apartment they

can't afford or conducting tense

discussions about finances in the

brightly lit tapas restaurant of their

choosing or marching into any bank and

applying for a small business loan to

get Brenda stupid cupcakes for dogs or

idea off the ground

Brenda all cupcakes are cupcakes for

dogs they eat their own Brenda

which is just as well because your

cupcakes are terrible

they're terrible be if you are surprised

by this don't worry you're not alone a

2013 poll showed that nearly 70% of

people thought it was illegal under

federal law for someone to be fired for

being gay people believe it because it

feels like it should be true it's

optimistic but wrong like thinking

vertical stripes are flattering or

making your first condom purchase

magnums optimistic but statistically

wrong and there are plenty of recent

real-life examples of discrimination

happening just look at Colin Du Barry

and Kelly Williams a Texas couple who

made the mistake of visiting a

restaurant called Big Al's where their

waitress had something to say to them

she said that we don't serve can I think

bags here

we don't serve here then the

waitress continued they say here at big

girls we like for men to act like men

and for ladies to act like ladies and it

was just so nonchalantly like I like

almost like she was reading a piece of

paper well she was that phrase is posted

on the front door of the restaurant

she's young lady didn't know what else

to say and they just kept on she finally

said and she said we just thought okay

that is obviously appalling and also

someone might want to tell Big O that

having a sign saying when men act like

men is actually the single gayest thing

imaginable so that's an example of

recent discrimination regarding public

accommodation for discrimination in the

workplace take the case of Casey steagle

a gay man employed as a children's

social services worker also in Texas his

fiancee showed up to help him one day

because he was overseeing a field trip

and wanted assistance and the next thing

he knew this happened well later in that

week I got a text message from the

president of children's home saying I

need to come meet with him and then told

me because of my lifestyle choices he

didn't feel comfortable having me on his

team anymore

for the record being gay is clearly not

a lifestyle choice a lifestyle choice is

when a man gets obnoxiously into jazz or

goes on an Atkins

diet and starts a food blog called

protein wolf both of which you should

actually be fired for but that's not

what we're talking about here tonight

the fact is this kind of discrimination

can have ripple effects like when this

Michigan couple had their pediatrician

refused to treat their baby just because

they were lesbians which as they point

out is crazy

we're not your patient she's your

patient and the fact that you can't your

job is to keep babies healthy then you

can't keep a baby healthy that has gay

parents exactly but to be fair no one

can keep any baby healthy regardless of

the parents babies are fleshy bacteria

magnets

they're basically vomits volcanoes

they're going to get sick and they're

going to make you sick that's just a

fact but it is amazing that any of those

stories are taking place in this day and

age and I'm not saying that this is the

case everywhere some states and cities

do have good protections and I suppose

we could wait for every state to catch

up but there are certain issues too

important to be left to the states

specifically civil rights and state

birds

you chose the scissor-tailed flycatcher

Oklahoma are you kidding me

how do not go with the Eastern Phoebe

That Bird is a pure winged Majesty but

you went to chose a piece of garbage

with a beak it looks like it fell out of

Miranda July's hair that's a barn

Oklahoma shame on you you're on the

wrong side of history

anyway the point is states have a

checkered history when it comes to civil

rights just look at Arkansas right now

not only do they not have any

anti-discrimination ordinances earlier

this year they actually passed an anti

anti-discrimination ordinance that

prevents any city or county from

extending civil rights protections to

gay people here is a sponsor of that law

explaining why I want to be treated

equal just like I want someone from the

LBGT community to be treated equal I

want to be fair to them and I want to be

fair to me they shouldn't get more

rights than I do and I shouldn't get

more rights Amil what are you talking

about this is not about special rights

we're not creating lesbians only

sections on airplanes or putting up

signs at Six Flags saying you must be

this gay to go on this right this is

just basic equality that's all in it now

there have been some positive moves at

the federal level just last month the

EEOC ruled the Civil Rights Act applies

to LGB workers and a year ago the

president added LGBT protections for

federal contractors all of which is

great but those protections could be

undone by his successor and it's worth

noting two of the Republican governors

running for president actually weakened

their state's non-discrimination

policies Bobby Jindal let an executive

order expire and John Kasich kept his

but removed the protections for

transgender workers for some reason and

it must be strange to live in a state

and see progress actually move backwards

it'd be like if apple suddenly

introduced the iPhone 7 and it was a

flip phone so that's still not as dumb

as the Apple watch but it's done

not that dumb but done now the main

argument against extending these

protections is that it might infringe on

religious freedom forcing people to act

against their religious beliefs

hence the rise of Religious Freedom

Restoration Act around the country and

religious freedom is not an inherently

bad thing and I'm not just saying that

because I'm the current mega Reverend of

Our Lady of Perpetual exemption we allow

for religious freedom in limited

sensible ways all the time it's why

Muslims can wear a hijab in their

driver's license photo and why devout

Christians can't be forced to work on

the Sabbath but there are reasonable

limits to it and we've all heard it

mistakenly cited in stories like this

Colorado Baker Jack Phillips estimates

he's made 5,000 wedding cakes since he

opened his shop masterpiece cakes 20

years ago a deeply religious man Jack

Phillips says he'll bake birthday cakes

cupcakes and a variety of other sweets

for same-sex couples just not a wedding

cake I actually feel like I'm taking

part in the wedding part of me goes to

the reception parts of you goes to the

reception I have a horrifying sense what

that might mean in a way I've been

married five thousand times in another

way I come in the cake

[Applause]

that Baker denied service to a gay

couple in 2012 citing his belief that

providing them with a wedding cake would

offend his definition of traditional

marriage but that's a little hard to

square with the fact that he allegedly

had no problem providing a cake for a

wedding between two docs and look those

dogs may lick their own balls but I'm

sure even they are now regretting

ordering a vanilla cone cake from the

ejaculating Baker of Colorado but but

the bigger flaw in his argument is his

understanding of how the law works the

Constitution guarantees me the right to

practice my faith my religion anywhere

anytime there are no restrictions on it

it also gives me the right to free

speech anytime anywhere except it

doesn't though courts have already

decided there are limits on religious

freedom for example they found that you

can't discriminate on race based on your

religious beliefs and there are limits

on free speech you can't yell fire in a

crowded theater the Constitution isn't

the star in Super Mario Brothers

it doesn't make you invincible so you

can just do whatever the you want

now just so you know that Baker lost his

case because Colorado happens to be one

of the states that has a law banning

discrimination based on sexual

orientation and when states have those

laws even states with religious freedom

acts cases do now tend to go gay

people's way which is good the problem

is there are still way too many states

that don't have anti-discrimination laws

at all so maybe it's time we just fix

all of this nationwide in one go and

interesting there is something called

the Equality Act in Congress right now

which adds LGBT protections to the Civil

Rights Act the Fair Housing Act and

several others it has over 200

co-sponsors in the House and Senate

unfortunately precisely 0 of them are

Republican which is genuinely difficult

to do for instance there's an actual

bill that just designated September the

25th as national lobster day even that

had two Republican co-sponsors and look

I'm not saying lobsters don't deserve

recognition from our governments

because they absolutely do although do

they that's not the point

that's not the point the point is this

bill represents the bare minimum of not

being discriminated against and this

should be what represents the threshold

of true gay tolerance not whether or not

you would consider attending a gay

wedding so we actually reached out to

every single presidential candidate from

both parties and asked them would you

support passage of a federal law all

laws that prohibit discrimination based

on sexual orientation and gender

identity specifically in the areas of

employment housing public accommodations

and access to credit it's not a

complicated question it's a long

question yes but it's not a complicated

one but only four campaigns got back to

us lincoln Chafee and martin O'Malley

said yes they would but to be honest I

think they were just happy anyone had

asked them anything

so discount that Bernie Sanders also

said he would and a spokesman for rand

paul said and this is true we'll pass

thanks okay you're welcome

everyone else is presumably still

thinking about it but why we reached out

on Thursday and it should not take that

long to work out the answer to should

gay people be discriminated against is

just know that's it because it is long

past time that gay people had the same

rights that straight people have namely

to be fired because they're being

replaced by a computer to be denied

service at a restaurant because they're

neither wealthy looking nor attractive

and more specifically to have a wedding

cake but not eat it because they suspect

a strange man may for some reason have

ejaculated into it

you

you

this year this year we've covered many

depressing aspects of our criminal

justice system from how mandatory

minimum sentencing is crowded our

prisons to how Bale punishes the poor to

how overstretched public defenders

threaten your right to a fair trial to

how small municipal violations can wind

up putting you in the barrel and

fun fact if you binge watch those

episodes in order you are entitled to an

ice cream cone at Dairy Queen

so congratulations enjoy it you have

earned it just to be clear it's not free

and Dairy Queen is not involved in any

capacity the point is though after

learning about our shattered justice

system you frankly earned the right to

eat your feelings with a peanut Buster

parfait the only frozen Treat in America

with nut buster as part of its name

anyone tonight instead of talking about

how people wind up in prison I thought

we talked about how they leave a process

known as prison re-entry it's

particularly relevant this week in light

of what happened just last weekend the

largest one-time release of federal

prisoners in history is getting underway

today the move is in response to a

loosening of mandatory minimum sentences

for nonviolent drug offenders about

6,000 prisoners are being set free today

yes 6,000 mostly low-level drug

offenders were released last week and if

you are one of them let me bring you up

to speed on what you may have missed

since you've been inside um Uber's

replace cabs everyone pretends to like

kale now Matthew McConaughey has an

Oscar and in four states pot is legal

which for some of you must seem like a

cruel cruel irony

now unsurprisingly this news was not

exactly welcomed by everyone

when you release people like that you're

going to have an increase in crime okay

no doubt my mind

some believe the prisoner release is a

racial deal that will put Americans in

jeopardy it's part of an effort to

reduce prison overcrowding but who

exactly are these prisoners are they

dangerous yes are they dangerous is this

the purge is it happening is this the

Pope what what do I need to buy a mask

or will one be provided for me I don't

know how the purge works now now to be

clear by and large these prisoners were

going to be released in a couple of

years anyway so people are essentially

freaking out about something that had it

happened two years later they wouldn't

even have noticed and it's also worth

noting that more than 600,000 people get

released from state and federal prisons

every year so 6,000 more would represent

an increase of less than 1% and the only

time anyone actually notices a change

that small is your dad with the

thermostat and hey when you have your

own place you can heat it like the

tropics but not what he's paying the

bills and fought you're burning money

unfortunately we have a lot of

misconceptions about what leaving prison

is actually like perhaps because it's

often presented in movies and TV as a

happy moment when former inmates rejoin

families and friends and put their life

back together real wort I never thought

I'd get out there's a good young good

hug it was important that we cut a deal

and Kenny was finally free

oh that's so nice although the last

thing was slightly undercut when Patrick

the starfish realized spongebob had

joined the Aryan Brotherhood 1 inside

hey hey he did what he had to do he did

what he had to do but but the sad truth

is for a surprisingly high number of

prisoners their time on the outside may

be brief the national average of

recidivism is 50% so we're spending 80

billion dollars and failing half the

time right that doesn't make any sense

no it doesn't make any sense the only

thing we're allowed to throw billions

out just to fail half the time is this

man

vandalized urban outfitters mannequin

Johnny Depp the fact that around half of

people who leave prison end up going

back is horrifying but when you look at

the challenges they face it gets a

little less surprising in fact let me

walk you through what it's like when you

get out of prison and let's just start

with minute one because when inmates

exit that gate to start a new life they

could find themselves in the middle of

nowhere with little to nothing in their

pockets and the lucky ones might get

enough for a bus ticket and a meal but

even exonerated prisoners like Glen Ford

can walk out with little to build a life

on Glen Ford was given a $20 gift card

the day he left Angola prison gave me a

card for $20 and said wish you luck

how long did that last year one meal had

some fried chicken tea and the French

fries came with it I had four dollars

and change left a twenty dollar gift

card if you're exonerated you should

probably believe in prison

with more than you take home after a

disappointing office Secret Santa and

hey don't don't act surprised that that

gift was terrible your name got picked

by Janice from accounting and you know

she don't give up

she don't give up how about you and look

once your money runs out you can find

yourself hungry and desperate because in

many states anyone with felony drug

convictions can be banned from

government food benefits and if your

family lives in public housing you may

not be able to return home because some

places require tenants to sign papers

banning relatives with convictions from

entering their homes and while those

rules may have been written to reduce

crime in public housing they're

administered so broadly it can lead to

situations like this

Geraldine Miller signed the ban after

her son robbed a bodega at 16 had I

didn't know what I know today I would

have never signed that paper Miller

herself now faces eviction after her son

was caught helping her with groceries

after she became ill she has to go to

her brother's apartment to see her son

my true want me to throw my son away I

can't I can't look we all want people

who've committed crimes to learn their

lesson but never help your sick mother

with groceries sounds more like the kind

of lesson you'd learn from a shitty Boy

Scout leader their kids never help your

sick mother with groceries always know

where the exits are in a dogfight

and never pay a stripper upfront scouts

dismissed and restricted access to food

and shelter could be just the beginning

of your problems depending on where you

live a felony conviction can cut you off

from everything from voting to a

driver's license - and this is true one

Florida County's home weatherization

program so I guess Florida is perfectly

happy to put people behind bars but they

draw the line at putting them behind

storm windows and insulation and while

you could pay for food shelter and

weatherization with a job your

opportunities to get one of those might

be severely limited there are state and

local bands preventing ex-felons from

working as everything from a nurse to a

septic tank cleaner - in Mississippi an

alligator rancher as if breaking into

the alligator ranching business wasn't

already hard enough as it is

you know I taught it's all who you know

who's been eaten by an alligator in that

guy

and a criminal record can even make

getting an interview for a job difficult

nearly every job application will ask a

potential employee if he or she has ever

been convicted of a felony a question

that in some cases will automatically

disqualify you from getting hired and

makes you a little uncomfortable you get

that anxiety when you get to that box

slave Wow

how they gonna judge me you know know

that I committed this crime how they're

gonna feel about this and it's

understandable that an employer might

want to know if an applicant has a

criminal history but to have that

question on a form before you've even

met the person seems a little unfair

they may have changed significantly

since then and you shouldn't judge

someone and what they may be most

ashamed of imagine if you had once

a watermelon maybe it happened 14

years ago you're not proud of it and

you've changed since then if every job

application you filled out had this

question on it with no opportunity to

give context about drunky were or the

fact you haven't even looked at a

watermelon for over a decade you'd begin

to feel like the deck was stacked

against you and some states seem to even

acknowledge how hard this process can be

Ohio actually has a list of job tips for

ex-offenders with do's and don'ts such

as do be honest but if you're asked why

you left your last job don't use

negative words like went to jail instead

do use terms like relocated or contract

ended both of these are true and they

are and before you judge that is not a

lie everyone tries to present the most

flattering image of themselves you do it

when you use a filter on an Instagram

photo of yourself even the Queen does it

because this is her official portrait

but this is who she actually is but deep

down she knows you can't put that face

on money

and all of this is before we get to the

difficulty of ex-prisoners navigating

parole 2/3 of parolees who go back to

prison do so not due to a new crime but

because of parole violations sometimes

for reasons as simple as missing

appointments or failing a drug test and

for some it may be because they're

dealing with untreated substance abuse

or mental illness but for others who are

trying their hardest satisfying the

conditions of parole can be maddeningly

difficult look at Bilal Chatman he spent

a decade in prison for a nonviolent drug

offense but despite the odds he managed

to get his life back on track and find a

job that he loved things were going well

until he hit a problem regarding

scheduling meetings with his probation

officer so he got off I think every day

about 4:00 and so my job didn't I think

it off till 4:30 I said okay what can I

come in early said no you can't come in

early I said what cable can I come a

little later can I get through at like 5

if you leave at 4:30 I don't stay and

wait for you I'm not gonna wait for you

so I don't want to lose my job this is

the things that I'm supposed to be doing

this is what I'm out here for so I'm

working to be a productive member of

society I felt it I felt set up I felt

like I was set up to fail I thought most

people in that situation or set are set

up to fail and you know what it is hard

to argue with that because the only way

Bilal could make an appointment at 4:00

if he left at 4:30

would be if he somehow owned a DeLorean

a TARDIS or whatever the John

Claude Van Damme used in Timecop

I can't remem I think he travelled

through time by doing the splits it's

been a while but I think it was a split

based system

also depending on where you live you

might not just struggle to meet your to

meet your parole officer you might

struggle to pay him because in many

states you actually have to pay for

probation and parole service and in

Pennsylvania they charged us $60 fee

just to enter the program and if you

don't have the money for all the fees

they charge as one Pennsylvania parolee

explains you can be forced to make a

truly ridiculous choice

you also see your parole officer you

don't have money it will hold you job or

no job and if you don't pay you come out

to Joe yeah I know one thing I found

myself southern drug to pay back to

civilian oh god so in order to pay for

the program to keep him away from

dealing drugs he has to earn money drug

dealing at this point the Pennsylvania

Department of Corrections might as well

change its motto to y'all come back now

you're here by now you may be wondering

who is responsible for a system this

broken well interestingly the answer is

pretty much everybody many of the

obstacles you've seen originated in the

tough-on-crime 90s with surprisingly

little debate remember the ban on ex

prisoners from entering public housing

which forced Geraldine Miller to kick

out her son well here's where that

started from now on the rule for

residents who commit crime and peddle

drugs should be one strike and you're

out

that is a state of the union standing

ovations from both sides almost nothing

gets a full room standing ovations

during those speeches with the exception

of veterans God and the speech being

over in many cases these laws were

passed with barely a second thought the

1996 law letting States restrict food

stamps for extra gallons was debated in

the Senate for all of three minutes I've

been talking about this subject for

nearly five times longer than they did

and I'm leaving a lot of stuff out

mainly because I had to make time for

Timecop references and frankly as well

no one batted an eye when bart gordon a

Democrat from Tennessee justified

cutting off federal student aid for

prisoners with this logic just because

one bland hog may occasionally find an

acorn doesn't mean many other blind hogs

will the same principle applies to

giving federal pell grants to prisoners

first of all pigs find nuts by smell so

a blind one is at no significant

disadvantage in an acorn hunt and second

of all people aren't pigs you asshole

and look I know I know

it is not it's not always easy to care

about the welfare of ex-prisoners and

some are going to re offend no matter

what you do but the fact remains over

95% of all prisoners will eventually be

released so it's in everyone's interest

that we try to give them a better chance

at success because under the current

system if they do manage to overcome all

the obstacles we've set it's a minor

miracle and one of the people who have

managed to beat those odds is Bilal

Chapman I'm happy to say that he is

still in his job and he's still doing

well and I'm even happy to say he's

actually with us this evening so please

welcome Bill Chappell please sit down

fill out fill out oh thank you so much

for coming tonight I know that you were

not sure about doing this so I want to

thank you for being here yes

now you managed to keep the job that you

were talking about in that clip and we

saw the state of Ohio giving advice to

prisoners about how to present their

truth and when you when you apply for

jobs you listed your previous employer

as what did you list state of California

the state of California that's right

that is yeah that's technically true

lettuce that's true that's true

yeah um now I know how is the job going

absolutely fantastic I couldn't I

couldn't script it another way

in any way better than what's going on

I'm very excited I'm very fortunate and

blessed

they've given me this opportunity yes I

am dedicated to them you know absolutely

one of and I know I know that you one of

the reasons you're nervous is that

because not everyone you work for or

with knows about the fact that you were

once in prison now you're going to work

tomorrow morning they may know by then

yes

so I guess guess what I want to know is

what what particularly are you most

worried about I got some more worried

about being judged for what it used to

be I'm not that same person you know

I've dedicated myself up I changed

myself I'm no longer that person you

know as time goes on you become you know

I become a better person

I've worked

hardly the things that that I've taken

from society and so yeah so what what

are the concerns that they'll what they

will think or how they might behave what

does this spectrum of circumstances that

you concerned I guess some more people

are judgmental people that don't know

you know I don't want anybody look at me

as the ex-con I want them to look at me

as a person I am now I'm a supervisor

you know I'm a good employee I'm an

employer I even hire and I fire right so

I think they want I want them to look at

me as that continue live that they were

about to both cheer and boo you when you

okay I guess that was interesting you

say that right that you don't want to be

defined by something that you did so

long ago because we're probably guilty

of giving you a reductive term in that

way because we're having you on tonight

as Bilal the ex-prisoner right which is

clearly not who you've been for a long

time right now everyone has at least

three other things about them that are

interesting what what three things about

you not related to that would you like

people to know well I don't like people

to know you know well you know I'm grow

tomatoes you like wait wait I'm gonna

stop you

yeah I'm going to stop you at number one

fair Bilal cos that's a lot more

interesting than I think you think it is

no I'm hoping that tomorrow you're in

your fellow workers may choose really

mainly to focus on the fact you grow

tomatoes right as being a more

interesting part of your life I know

that one of the things that's

interesting is that I know how hesitant

you were to do this we talked to you

through the week yes as we even talked

to you today and tonight I guess a

question would be why why did you end up

talking to us what why are you here

I'm here because it affected um you know

I may never do this again

I've done other interviews I mean I

would do this again because this takes

me back to being that prisoner again I'm

not that prisoner today I'm a taxpayer

you know I work I'm a citizen I'm a

voter that's who I want to be those are

the things that have defined me today

it's not what I did before I did things

years ago then I'm ashamed of you know

that I don't like but I don't want to

relive that at the same time I want this

opportunity to be for someone who says

oh man I can never get a chance I'll

never have a chance there's always a

chance we just keep going but I want the

person also that looks at down at us

that maybe there's a chance for other

people too

that's right I thought fill out I can't

thank you enough for taking the time to

be here Bilal Chatman later the tomato

grower

you

Equifax.

The company whose name sounds
like a theatrical production

in which Daniel Radcliffe,
plays a horse

-that fucks a fax machine.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Now Equifax,

is one of the big three
credit reporting agencies.

The companies who keep
financial data on all of us.

So that people like uh, lenders
and landlords can decide,

whether or not
we are trustworthy.

So, Equifax controls some of our
most sensitive information

and about a month ago,
we learned this.

NEWSCASTER 1:
 Breaking news from the
 credit monitoring company,

Equifax.

Cyber thieves making off
 with private information

of 143 million Americans,

nearly half the U.S. Population.

It's actually worse.

It's now 145 million Americans

and I have got good news
and bad news there.

The good news is that
by "private information"

they don't mean
your Google search history, so,

nobody yet knows about the time
you searched for,

"wario porn (real),"

or "world's richest dogs
looking for assistants,"

or "can loneliness
cause the farts?"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

But the bad news is,
the information they got,

could well be all this.

NEWSCASTER 2: It's your name,
 social security number,

birth date, driver's license
 and addresses where you lived,

information that
 is mostly permanent

unless you're in
 federal witness protection.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Wow! Okay,

so, that does sound bad,

but here's a simple solution,
just move 145 million people

into the witness
protection program.

That means Jones'
uh, you are the Thompson's,

uh, Thompson's
you're the Campbell's,

Campbell's
you're the Mendoza's,

Mendoza's, you're the Jones'.

Wait-- wait hold on,
Jones' you shouldn't be there,

I made you the Thompson's.

No, Thompson's I made you
the Campbell's.

Campbell's,
you're the Mendoza's.

Mendoza's, why are you there?

You should be living
in the Jones' house in Phoenix.

Oh no, I shouldn't have
said Phoenix.

-Oh God, the Jones' are dead!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-The Jones' are dead!
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

Forget the whole plan,
I was just trying to help!

I'm sorry for trying!
Oh, they're dead!

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-And-- and I know--

-I know there might be...
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

...some younger people
watching this

and, well hold on-- who cares?

We're the first generation

to routinely send pictures
of our junk to each other

-over the internet.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Why should we give a shit

about someone seeing
our social security numbers?

But you should know,

criminals can do a lot more
with that number

than they can with a picture
of your dick.

This information
is gonna be sold

left and right
on the black market.

People are gonna be
able to open up credit cards

for the rest of your life
once they have that information.

They can go out and purchase
a home in your name.

They can open bank accounts,
take car loans.

Someone who has your
social security number

could actually take a job,
they could file taxes

and even claim
your kids as dependents

and be gone with your refund

before you ever actually file
a tax return.

No! No!

No, the tax benefit,

is the whole point
of having children.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Without that,

all you're left with
is your actual children.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Which, you know...

-Ugh!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

The point here is,
it's a huge problem

and in any other era,

this would've been
the biggest news story

for a month, but--

but now that
every day's headline

is simply the words,

"Everything batshit
bananas again today,"

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-it slipped under the radar,

but it is worth asking,
"How the hell did this happen?"

Because the short answer is,

the people in-charge have done
literally everything wrong.

And let's start with just--

just the way that Equifax
told us about the hack.

In early September,
their then CEO, Rick Smith,

a man with a face and name
so bland

he may as well be called,
"Human Person,"

or "Frasier re-run."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-He issued a taped apology,

but his remorse seemed a little
less than heart felt.

On July 29th of this year,
we discovered that attackers

had gained unauthorized access
to certain Equifax data files.

This is clearly
a disappointing event

and one that strikes
at the heart...

of who we are
and what we do.

-Holy shit!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Rick Smith is so
alarmingly mechanical

you probably have to put him
in rice every time he gets wet.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now, notably

he mentioned there that Equifax
learned about the breach

on July 29th,

but even more notably that video
was uploaded in September,

which is, and this is true,
after July.

So, Equifax
knew about the breach

for nearly six weeks

before telling the public
and they claim

that they needed that time
because the investigation was

"complex and time consuming."

Although, that's not all
that happened in that time span.

NEWSCASTER 3: Three Equifax
 executives

sold nearly two million dollars
 in company stock,

days after the data breach
 was discovered.

Wow!

Selling stock before the public
knows there's a problem

is one of those thing
that looks suspicious

whether or not you're
actually doing something wrong.

It's like, walking
into a petting zoo,

with a bib on.

What exactly are you planning

-on messily devouring in there?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And Equifax defended
that saying,

none of the executives
in question

including their
Chief Financial Officer

knew about the data breach,
which raises another question,

-"How is that even possible?"
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Did they just ignore emails
with the subject lines,

"Breach!"
"Following up on breach!"

"Where the fuck are you?
Breach, breach, breach!"

And, "Just spoke to you
in person about breach

and you just stared blankly
at me, and then said,

'I'm gonna order
from the salad place.'"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And if you are getting
frustrated already

with this kind of incompetence,

you're gonna need
to pace yourself,

because this story,
gets a lot worse.

Apparently,
there were multiple points

where this hack
could have been prevented

and one of them is incredible,

because Equifax were alerted
by Homeland security,

back in March,

that they needed to fix
a critical vulnerability

in their software.

But as lawmakers discovered
at a recent hearing,

that's not what happened.

There was one person apparently,
who forgot to tell somebody

that they had a piece
of software

that needed to be patched.

Yeah, it is not ideal,

that a company guarding
such valuable information

leaves something that important
down to one person.

It's like finding out
that Chase Bank

has a big red button labeled,
"Lose everyone's money,

and the only thing
stopping anyone from pushing it,

-is Frank."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And look, I love Frank.

I love the guy,
but what if he has to pee?

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

A-- and I want to tell you
that this is an anomaly,

but Equifax has had multiple
headline-grabbing breaches

over the years,

and that is not even counting
smaller incidents like this.

I checked my credit report
the other day

online with Equifax...

That was it, and next thing
I know I have 300 pieces of mail

sittin' in my mailbox.

NEWSCASTER 4: Every single one
 of these is addressed to her,

but they're not hers.

Instead, she got
 other people's credit reports.

Now, names,
 social security numbers,

dates of birth, current
 and previous addresses

bank and loan account numbers,

all stacked up
on a kitchen table in Biddeford.

-(AUDIENCE GROANING)
-Yeah, I mean,

that not great, is it?

And it really should have
set off red flags at Equifax,

when hundreds of different
credit reports

were being mailed
to the same address.

What exactly did you think
had happened there

that every single Fraggle
checks their credit at once,

down at Fraggle Rock?

-Down at Fraggle Rock?
-(AUDIENCE CLAPPING)

-Now-- very nice.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-And--
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And I know that other companies
have had breaches

but none remotely as damaging
as this new Equifax one,

'cause remember,
this isn't Target

exposing
customer's credit cards.

This is compromising
social security numbers

the things that thieves
could use

to open new credit cards
in your name

and if your information
was stolen, which remember,

is about a 50-50 chance,
it could haunt you forever.

You don't change
your birth date,

you don't change your
social security number.

Those who've been, uh,
jeopardized by this hack

will have to protect themselves
 for years, until they're dead.

It's true and just
think about that.

There is only one other thing

that you have to
constantly protect yourself from

until you're dead.

-And that's fucking death!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And you would hope that Equifax
would do a decent job

of mitigating the damage.

After all,

they did have nearly six weeks
to work on a response,

but instead,
their fuck ups continued.

For instance, they created
a website

for concerned consumers
to go to,

but then this happened:

The site that Equifax started
is called Equifax Security 2017.

But a developer named
 Nick Sweeting,

wanted to show,
 how easy it is

to create a similar fake site,
 so he did.

He called it,
 Security Equifax 2017.

(AUDIENCE GROANING)

Exactly, someone created
a fake site

and if you're thinking,
"Well, who would be dumb enough

to fall for that?"

Equifax! That's who!

Because they tweeted links
to that fake site

at least eight times!

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
IN DISBELIEF)

Despite the fact that site had
a couple of tiny clues

that it might be fake
from the headline reading,

"Why did Equifax use a domain

that's so easily impersonated
by phishing sites?"

to the fact that when you
clicked on their
Frequently Asked Questions,

this happened.

♪ ("NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP"
BY RICK ASTLEY PLAYING) ♪

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
AND CHEERING)

Well played pranksters,
you have my respect.

But look, don't worry.

Equifax says that they are
tightening up their operation.

And to see how well
that they've done on that,

You-- you can just go to,
equifaxfraudprevention.com,

not because it's their site
but because it's our site.

We bought it two days ago,

and if you'll go there
you'll find the message,

"How were we still able
to do this?

Why haven't you learned
anything?"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

But wait-- wait!
Because there is even more.

'Cause Equifax
also offered consumers

a year of free credit monitoring

but when people tried to sign-up
for the service,

they noted something.

Guess what? You lock into
Equifax terms of service

-when sign-up for it,
-Ah!

which means that you
can't sue the company.

You've gotta resolve any
disputes in forced arbitration.

Exactly! You'll be giving up
your right to sue.

So legally, your best recourse
at that point would be,

shaking your fist at the heavens
while shouting, "Equifax!"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Now, they-- they've since
rescinded that clause,

although many frustrated people
are now signing up

for third party credit
monitoring services like,

LifeLock, who've been
advertising everywhere.

And they've seen a real surge
in business

in the wake
of this breach, although,

if you're considering LifeLock
because you are mad at Equifax,

there is something
you're gonna need to know.

According to filings
with the SCC,

LifeLock purchases
credit monitoring services from

-Equifax.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

And that means someone buys
credit monitoring

through LifeLock.

LifeLock turns around
and passes some of that revenue

directly along to Equifax.

Is that right Mr. Smith?

That is correct.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
IN DISBELIEF)

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-It's true. Some of--
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

some of the money that you pay
to LifeLock

goes right back
to fucking Equifax,

which could only be
more infuriating

if you then found out that
the rest of it goes

to Toys For Todds.

A charity that purchases
sex toys

-for grown men named Todd.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Buy your own sex toys Todd,
we can't carry you on this one.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And look, Equifax
connections aside,

LifeLock has had
repeated issues itself,

including settlements
with the FTC

and a truly disastrous
ad campaign

a few years back.

I'm Todd Davis,

and I'm here
to prove just how safe

your identity can be
with LifeLock.

That's my real
social security number.

Yeah, LifeLock's then-CEO
Todd Davis,

actually put his real
social security number,

457-55-5462,

on a truck and billboards.

For a time, it was impossible
to escape

his social security number,

-457-55-5462.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

And that was a very cocky move

and one that resulted in him
having his identity stolen

-13 times.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

And I'm guessing,
that the defense

for the people who took it was,

"I didn't steal his identity

I literally got it off
the back of a truck."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-So, to put it mildly,

LifeLock, may not be your
best solution

to the Equifax crisis,
which brings us to the question,

"What is?"

Well, consumer advocates told us

that the one big step
everyone should take,

is to go through all three large
credit reporting companies,

that's Equifax, Experian
and TransUnion,

and freeze your credit.

That way no one can access it,
including you,

until you unfreeze it.

Now the companies also offer

their own credit protection
products,

with names like, Trusted ID

or Credit Lock Plus.

But, they are
often more expensive

and offer fewer
consumer protection.

So, if you need a way
to remember this,

locks, are something
you don't want.

Think of Justin Bieber's
dreadlocks.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-A terrible decision

to be avoided!

Whereas freezes are great.

Uh, think of this tiny penguin
losing its frozen mind.

♪ (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

See! So, to recap,

-locks, oof, freezes, wee!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Now-- now, here is the thing--
here's the thing on this.

Freezing and unfreezing
of your credit can cost money

which will go back to these
companies, because seemingly,

they just can't
fucking lose on this.

And if you need any more
proof of that,

on the very same day

that Congress was yelling at
Equifax's former CEO,

it emerged that the company
had just been awarded

a seven-million-dollar contract
by the IRS, to prevent fraud,

which led one senator to make
a pretty brutal comparison.

You realize, to many Americans
right now, that looks like uh...

we're giving Lindsay "Lohawn"
the keys to the mini bar.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING IN SHOCK,)
APPLAUDING)

I understand your point.

That was the pause of man
thinking, "Do I let that pass?"

"Do I correct him
on how to pronounce Lohan?"

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Or do I double down

and pronounce her name,
"Lingonberry Lahoni Baloney."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And you should know--
you should know

that IRS deal
has been suspended,

not cancelled by the way,
just suspended.

And that might make you angry
but the problem is,

that anger won't have
much impact on Equifax.

Because they make
most of their money

selling our data to businesses,
like banks.

So, in their eyes,

we are not the consumer,
we're the product.

To think of it in terms of KFC.

We are not the guy buying
the ten-piece buckets,

-we're the fucking chickens!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

So, for the time being,

businesses are the only ones
who can exert influence here

and as one colorfully dressed
expert pointed out,

that's not gonna happen
anytime soon.

I haven't heard any big company
came out-- come out yet

and say, "We're not gonna use
Equifax anymore"

-for their credit scores.
-STUART VARNEY: Good point.

So far, everybody's been quiet,

and I don't know what they're
waiting to hear.

This is outrageous,
they should be done

but I bet you,

because it's America,
they'll be okay.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Here's the truth,

that angry business casual
farm animal on Fox Business

-is talking sense.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And that sentence alone
shows just how bad things are.

So, in the long term,

there should clearly be
major reform to this industry

and how it's regulated,

but that is going to take time,
so until then

you need to freeze
your credit reports

with all three
of these companies,

and only unfreeze them

when you need to apply
for credit.

And because the freeze option

can be hard to find
on their sites

if you go to our twitter feed,

we will give you exact links
to do that, and when you do,

they will give you a PIN number
that you need to unfreeze it.

So, do not lose that number,
or at the very least,

make it something memorable.

I don't know, like...

-457-55-5462.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-But not that, 'cause of course

that's Todd Davis's
social security number.

torture it's the thing that happens to

Mel Gibson in all his movies

this little piggy stayed home Wow that

is awful

although I will say the past decade of

Mel Gibson's life has made those clips

slightly more enjoyable to watch sadly

torture is not just something that

happens to Mel Gibson it's also been

practiced by the United States as

President Obama admitted last summer in

a bizarre manner in the immediate

aftermath of 9/11 we did some things

that were wrong we did a whole lot of

things that were right but we tortured

some folks that's a weird way to phrase

that you said what you're quoting a

horrifying Andy Griffith episode you see

Opie things got a little out of hand

down at the jailhouse and Barney and I

well we tortured some folks we tortured

those folks good okay

the president's comments were triggered

by the Senate intelligence committees

massive 6700 page report on the CIA's

detention and interrogation program the

full report remains classified but a 500

page summary was released in December

and it is even actually available on

Amazon and you should get a copy

especially if you're looking for a truly

terrible book club pick because this has

got to be right up there with a lawn

mower repair manual or Bill Cosby's

memoir time flies you know when time

really flies when you lose consciousness

for three hours and wake up in Bill

Cosby's limo but the point is clearly

most people have not read this summary

that's not particularly shocking what is

shocking is that many of those actually

involved in the programs even former

director of the CIA Porter Goss have not

read it either I have not read a word of

the report I have not read a word of any

of this stuff how how have you not read

it you're in it 81 times

spoiler alert buy the story spoiler

alert

you can do it though just knock out a

chapter a night and if you can't find

the time to sit down and read it don't

worry we've made an audiobook version

with Academy award-winning actress Helen

Mirren reading the report for you and

I'm not kidding about that she did it

for us take a listen

the CIA placed individuals with no

applicable experience or training in

senior detention and interrogation roles

yes reading the report that you should

have already read for you Porter Goss so

put it on in your car and King listen to

it and look I know no one no one wants

to read this or talk about what's in it

but there are a few things in here that

we all should really grapple with

because as a recent poll revealed a lot

of us may have some dangerous

misconceptions about torture 69% of

Americans told us they consider

waterboarding to be torture but nearly

half 49% said such tactics are sometimes

justified and more than half 57 percent

said these interrogation techniques

often or sometimes provide reliable

information that can help prevent terror

attacks 57% of us are confident that

torture works that is a lot according to

one poll only 46% of Americans are

confident in the big bang theory which

is crazy because that is literally

explained to us every week in the

opening credits of the big bang thing

and sadly there is no sitcom theme that

explains torture to us at least not

since they canceled two guys a girl and

a black site prison and if you're

thinking why are we talking about this

now didn't we pass a law banning all

those enhanced interrogation techniques

well it turns out no we didn't we

checked and the only restrictions put in

place were by an executive order

President Obama signed in 2009 requiring

interrogations to follow the Army Field

Manual and that's it and executive

orders can be instantly overturned as

soon as the president leaves office and

think about that that means president

Lindsey Graham could undo that on his

first day in office and to be honest

that just seemed like a nice thing to do

for him it he can put that image in a

frame and he can look at it while he's

not being president for the rest of his

life but let let's look at the report

together because it challenges a lot of

the assumptions in that poll first we

did a lot more than just waterboarding

we learned that one CIA officer played

Russian roulette with a detainee another

threatened a detainee with a gun and a

power drill we learned at least five

detainees were subjected to so-called

rectal rehydration or feeding through

the rectum with no medical necessity yes

forced rectal rehydration and the

details of that in a footnote of this

report are so graphic not even Helen

Mirren can make them sound appealing

maajid khan's lunch tray consisting of

hummus pasta with sauce nuts and raisins

was pureed and rectally infused just

trying not to think about that the next

time you eat hummus in fact I feel like

I should preemptively apologize to the

Sabra hummus brands because your sales

are about to drop quite noticeably and

it doesn't stop there the report also

cites the tragic case of ghoul ramen a

completely innocent man picked up in a

case of mistaken identity who was

shackled to the wall of his cell and

later found dead likely from hypothermia

and at this point we could all probably

do with hearing Helen Mirren reading

something a little more pleasant maybe

some Beatrix Potter Flopsy Mopsy and

Cottontail

good little bunnies went down the lane

to gather blackberries Oh Thank You

Helen that's so much nicer please tell

me more about the bunnies

but while Flopsy Mopsy and Cottontail

were on their way to pick blackberries

peter was chained to a wall in Farmer

McGregor's basement

he'd been badly beaten and a tray of

carrots and raisins was pureed and

rectally in fumes about you for years

you're a monster look you may think as

57% of you evidently do then at least

those tough techniques provided us with

reliable intelligence well not so much

the reports most damning conclusion is

that the tactics were ineffective

despite the CIA's claimed at 20

detainees subjected to them shared

crucial information some of which led to

Osama bin Laden

our staff reviewed every one of the 20

cases and not a single case holds up

torture is one of those things that is

advertised to something that works but

doesn't like a Ford truck or all those

weird bottles of horny goat weed

available at your local bodega but but

maybe the reason that so many of us

innately believe that torture works is

because it does on TV all the time look

at 24 Jack Bauer repeatedly saved

American lives while behaving like this

you're gonna tell me what I want to know

you're gonna start losing your fingers

one by one

where

you probably don't think that any forces

towel down your throat trust me I can

Emmy for Best Drama 2006 beat The

Sopranos great show look torture works

on 24 and in movies because it has to

it's a dramatic device to move the plot

along but art terror experts and they'll

tell you it's one of those movie tropes

that's got no basis in real life like a

wedding being interrupted or someone

this handsome feeling sad or or this

character being partisan it works

because they just says it does and we're

supposed to take it and yet even

supposedly smart people like Antonin

Scalia an ill-tempered bullfrog in a

robe they cite 24 as evidence that

torture could be justified he said Jack

Bauer saved Los Angeles he saved

hundreds of thousands of lives is any

jury going to convict Jack Bauer I don't

think so

and look Justice Scalia just because

Kiefer Sutherland does something on

camera does not mean it's a great idea

unless of course that thing is him

drunkenly running into a Christmas tree

explain everything

[Applause]

yes yes on December 25th we should no

longer celebrate the birth of Christ we

should celebrate that look it's clearly

not all 24s fault

some people continue to insist that our

tactics saved lives citing two

particular cases no Karla chick Mohammad

and Abu Zubaydah provided the

overwhelming majority of reports on al

Qaeda both of them were uncooperative at

first the application of enhanced

interrogation techniques specifically

waterboarding especially in the case of

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed it's what really

persuaded him he needed to cooperate

look I know what you're thinking that is

a reasonable statement from a famously

reasonable man but but let's just look

at those two examples first Abu Zubaydah

the CIA of claims that subjecting him to

enhanced interrogation disrupted two

plots but it turns out he disclosed

those plots before he was waterboarded

and the reports now tells us that they

were judged to be infeasible those plots

and in one case hilariously infeasible

because it concerned two would-be

terrorists who had and this is true

proposed a plot based on a satirical

internet article entitled how to make an

h-bomb which instructed people to enrich

uranium by placing it in a bucket

attaching it to a six-foot rope and

swinging it around your head as fast as

possible for 45 minutes and we all know

that is not how to make an h-bomb that

is the brewing process for Bud Light

line

a scientific fact it's how they do it

now hospital shaykh muhammad he did come

he did give us information after he was

waterboarded that's true

but he's worth noting the quality of

that information he told investigators

that he had sent Abu Issa a Brittani to

Montana to recruit african-american

Muslim converts the FBI scrambles

launches a massive investigation in

Montana trying to find these supposed

black al-qaeda operatives but the FBI

found nothing

KSM was lying yeah of course he was

lying what part of the phrase recruiting

african-american Muslims in Montana did

not make you called instantly

even this week we've learned that the

most famous black person from Montana

may actually be white none of this is to

say that we don't need information from

detainees but if you want to see how to

get it without torture just watch a

former FBI agents Jack Cloonan who

worked in the bin Laden unit show you

how it's done you want to be able to

build a rapport with somebody you are

their salvation because their life as

they know it is over

something I can do for your kids you

concerned about them you want the magic

kid I'll get them educated what do you

want tell me what you want scrip for me

your exit strategy how do you extricate

yourself from this terrible situation by

the way that you put yourself in now you

can't go back home Kenyon no so let's

make peace with that let me help you

find this strategy to give you a life

holy I would tell that man any of

my secrets the fun name I have my

glasses is fixing mcpeepers I want to

try to bleach my anus with Crest

Whitestrips

every day at 2:00 p.m. I cheer myself up

by silently eating four marshmallows

from the back at my desk and I call it a

marshmallow party please stop looking at

me I'll tell you anything so look there

is no proof that torture does any good

but there is real proof that it has

serious harm to America's image overseas

references to American torture show up

everywhere from terrorist recruiting

tools to statements from North Korea who

have called our techniques brutal

medieval and the most insulting thing

about that is that knowing them they

probably meant it as a compliment and

the problem is the rules we have on the

books to stop us from returning to the

dark days of torture are in one easily

reversible executive order now as it

happens John McCain and Diane Feinstein

have proposed an amendment you up for a

vote next week which puts the most basic

parts of the president's executive order

into actual law and we should pass that

because if we don't there is no

guarantee that the next president will

uphold the ban in fact we asked all

fourteen declared candidates whether

they would consider overturning the

president's order and only four of them

told us definitively that they would

definitely keep it in place as for the

rest they either ignored us or avoided

answering directly which is very

frustrating because we need that

information badly from them and the

problem is we can't torture them to get

it because as this report more than

proves that doesn't work

here's the thing if enhanced

interrogation were not torture which it

is and even if torture did work which it

doesn't America should not be a country

that tortures people because it is

brutal

it is medieval and it is beneath us and

when the rest of the world thinks about

America they should not think of this

because that's not what this country is

about they should be thinking about this

[Applause]

Christmas tree

[Applause]

you

school

if Pink Floyd had gone to one they'd

have known its we don't need any

education you undermined your point now

it is it's currently back-to-school

season and for millions the school

they'll be attending will be a charter

school the things the politicians love

to praise I called for a doubling of our

investment in charter schools I'm a big

believer in charter schools

I believe in public Trotta schools

charter schools work and they work very

well charter schools are so successful

that almost every politician can find

something good to say about them yes

Seana schools unite both sides of the

aisle more quickly than when a wedding

DJ throws on hay yah oh look at Nana

dancing we can never let her know what

this song is about charters are

basically public schools that the

taxpayer funded but privately run and

now the first ones in most 25 years ago

as places to experiment with new

educational approaches and since then

they've exploded there are now over 6700

charter schools educating almost 3

million students and some have celebrity

backers like Puff Daddy Andre Agassi and

even pitbull who helps helped launch

Miami's slam Academy he was a keynote

speaker at a charter school conference

in 2013 and his speech has not aged well

for reasons that all become painfully

clear they told me that uh Bill Cosby

has spoken here before which i think is

amazing someone that I really relate to

I also love jello you know yes yes that

does look bad now but to be fair it was

not commonly known at the time that

jello was responsible for dozens of

cases of sexual assault turns out jello

is a monster I think I'm legally okay to

say that

the point is jello and and look when

pitbull has a charter school it seems

like it might be worth taking a look at

them and first let me acknowledge this

is a controversial area charter

proponents will point to positive news

stories like this one about the Kipp

charter schools network most Kipp

students are chosen by lottery

regardless of prior academic record

almost all meet federal poverty guy

lines and yet 82% go on to college I

think one thing that I learned that Kipp

really well is that a lot of your effort

doesn't reap any success until way later

in the future now honestly any

philosophy that can get those kind of

results might be worth considering in

the same way that if we found out they

boosted our immunity

we'd seriously consider eating koalas

but but critics critics argue charters

overstate their successes siphon off

talented students and divert precious

resources within a school district now

for this piece and I know this is going

to make some people on both sides very

angry we're going to set aside whether

or not charter schools are a good idea

in principle because whether they are or

not in 42 states and DC we're doing them

so instead we're going to look at how

they operate in practice one group found

on average charters have a slight edge

over traditional public schools in

reading indeed about the same in math

but acknowledged charter quality is

uneven across the states and across

schools and that is putting it mildly

because around the country there have

been charter schools so flawed they

don't make it through the school year

this charter school suddenly closed its

doors in the middle of the day in Orange

County charter schools suddenly closed

its doors without notice the local

charter school is suddenly and

unexpectedly closing its doors on our

dining room table my son left these two

notes to us one says dear mom is the

school going out of business yes yes you

are right

that kid spelled business business which

I'd argue is a much better way to spell

it now that that school was actually

shut down just six weeks into the school

year so to be honest they probably

should have been much better at business

and charters in some states can have an

alarming failure rate two years ago a

Florida paper found that since 2008 a

hundred and nineteen charter schools had

closed there fourteen of which had never

even finished their first school year so

fourteen schools in Florida were

outlasted by nbc's mysteries of laura a

show which once ended an episode like

this i have a hot date tonight

who threesome actually

but a threesome joke about of king

children it was in the first season and

they gave her another one and the point

is when schools closed that fast

it's shocking because you would assume

someone would rigorously screen a school

before it was allowed to open making

sure it was financially and academically

sound but that is not always the case

take forwarders ruv academies which shut

down after just seven weeks due to a

lack of among other things a school the

schools were repeatedly kicked out of

their buildings shuttled students among

multiple sites including the signature

grand reception hall in Davie

two local churches in Fort Lauderdale

and holiday park

they also bus students on Daley field

trips because they didn't have enough

classrooms Daley field trips how's that

even possible

surely by day ten you've run out of

ideas and they're taking kids to

Marshalls to return a belt hey pretty

pretty great right kids

I'll probably get store credit so put on

your adventure hats we're about to go on

a magical twelve dollar scavenger hunt

so how did those schools get approved

well Florida's charter process begins

with a lengthy application and Ivy

Academy's was four hundred pages long

and their founder Trayvon Mitchell

included passages like this one

beginning instruction is scaffolded to

provide targeted support with the goal

of increasing independence it goes on

and it sounds great but weirdly we found

this application by a school called

Franklin Academy in Fort Lauderdale

which predates that by two years and

which features this passage which begins

instruction will scaffold and then

continues in almost exactly the same way

it's basically identical but for a few

small differences like the Olsen twins I

mean you know you know one of them came

first and then Mary Kate plagiarized her

face

now that behavior might not be illegal

but it's certainly unethical or if I

make once from the IV Academy handbook

you will not plagiarize works that you

find on the Internet plagiarism is

taking the ideas or writings of others

and presenting them as if they were

yours so the application for Mitchel

school would also have been grounds for

him getting thrown out of that school

and incidentally that's not the only

thing he may have stolen he has since

been accused of spending funds for

students on himself and is awaiting

trial for grand theft and the problem

with the approval process being to

Easy's there is a lot at stake in

charter schools they get paid on a per

student basis on average that's about

seven thousand dollars for every

enrollment and that adds up take

Philadelphia's Harambee charter school I

know I know they named it a long time

ago and it's spelled differently your

king monsters rest in peace now that's

gone that's gone received more than five

million dollars in taxpayer money at the

same year that this story emerged by day

the Harambee Institute charter school

looks like any other educating some 450

students from kindergarten through

eighth grade but by night the cafeteria

turns into club domani

a bar that authorities say is unlicensed

and illegal oh wow a nightclub in an

elementary school is a recipe for

disaster because those are the two most

vomit prong populations in the world

they must've had to Febreze the out

of that place now you'll be glad to hear

that that schools under new leadership

now although that might be because its

CEO pled guilty to fraud for embezzling

nearly 80 thousand dollars from the

Harambee Institute rest in peace and and

look you can say that's an isolated

incident but it isn't in Philadelphia

alone at least 10 executives or top

administrators have pled guilty in the

last decade to charges like fraud

misusing funds and obstruction of

justice which may be why Philly magazine

advises parents don't forget to Google

any schools you're looking at to make

sure they won't once unexpectedly shut

down or run by a CEO who pleaded guilty

to theft all of which speaks to a

general atmosphere perhaps best

articulated by the state auditor I said

it before and I will say it again

Pennsylvania has the worst charter

school in the United States that is not

good because it is not like having the

worst something is new for Pennsylvania

remember this is a state that has the

worst football fans the worst Bell and

the worst regional delicacy yes if I

wanted Cheez Whiz on my steak sandwich I

need a kiddy cafeteria the restaurant

run by six-year-olds and and I'm not

even sure Pennsylvania deserves to be

called the worst because

Ohio's charter law was for decades so

lacks even charter advocates have called

it the Wild West

the state has around 360 charters and

their Governor John Kasich

speaks often about how much he loves

choice and competition in schools we

will improve the public schools if

there's a sense of competition it's just

like a pizza shop in the town if there's

only one and and there's not much

pepperoni on it you can call til you're

blue in the face but the best way to get

pepperoni on more pepperoni on that

pizza is to open up a second pizza shop

and that's what's going to improve our

public schools

okay okay that doesn't work on any level

first no one has ever called it a pizza

shop second it's a little hard to hear

the man who just defunded Planned

Parenthood talked about the importance

of choice third there's such a thing

there is such a thing as paying for

extra pepperoni like a normal person

and finally the notion that the more

pizza shops there are the better pizza

becomes is effectively undercut by the

two words Papa John's but but Ohio's

charters have had huge problems with

lack of oversight a review of one year's

state audits found charters misspent

public money nearly four times more

often than any other form of

taxpayer-funded agency and some cases

are incredible like that of Lisa ham a

school superintendent who was accused of

spending money for her school on sparse

jewelry luggage plays Vetri care and

trips to Europe and to see Oprah she

took a plea deal without admitting guilt

but not before delivering this fantastic

explanation proverbs says without vision

people perish and it's very important

for people to have a vision for their

own lives and in order to do that they

need to experience what's possible in

life and in order to transfer that to

the children they have to experience it

themselves that is amazing

she's just spouting a bunch of vague

about inspiration crossing her

fingers and hoping people will buy it

and you know what when you put it like

that I feel like she has learned a lot

from Oprah money well-spent and it's

Nellie for the record when she quoted

proverb saying where there is no vision

the people perish she's leaving out the

very next line which is but he that

keepeth the law happy is he and that's a

king important caveat

and what's crazy is there are ways to

profit off of charter schools perfectly

legally in Ohio and there have been for

years

look at this episode of frontline from

2000 by law

charter schools must be nonprofit but

the schools can hire an educational

management company or a mo to run the

school and the e mo can try to make a

profit

Brennan calls his e mo white hat

management education is first last and

always a business if it's run like a

business it can be done profitably yes

education is first last and always a

business take the L off the word

learning and what do you got earning

take the e off it what do you got then

arning yeah sure that's not a word but

it could be in one of our English

classes now that man's company white hat

management worked on two contracts where

each charter would pay ninety five

percent or more of its government

funding to white hats which as a private

company isn't obligated to provide the

same level of transparency as say a

school district so taxpayers could have

little idea how that money was being

spent and who can say if that's a good

system or not all I know is white hat

ran thirty two of the lowest performing

schools in the state and if you do

essentially the same terrible thing more

than 30 times in a row you're not a

management company

you basically Billy Joel's Greatest Hits

volumes two and three and at this point

you may be thinking charters were

completely unmonitored but that is where

you would actually be wrong because they

are approved and overseen by what are

called authorizes and while some states

sharply limit who can be an authorizer

Ohio allowed many different groups

including nonprofits to do it meaning

well let's say I wanted to open the John

Oliver Academy for nervous boys

and let's say I had a pre-existing

nonprofit called Johnny's kids that

could potentially have overseen my

school and that basically happened

take the Richard Allen chain of schools

in Ohio whose president was a woman

called Jeannette Harris

they were overseen by Kids Count a

non-profit founded by Jeannette Harris

which oversaw the schools as they spent

a million tax dollars on management and

consulting firms founded by wait for it

Jeannette King Harris now Harris denies

a conflict of interest because she

claims she wasn't directly involved in

decision-making and maybe maybe the

school's just chose Kids Count because

it had a proven track record of great

oversight so let's let's just check in

on one of the other schools they oversaw

a local charter school padded its

attendance records resulting in more

than a million dollars in extra money

state auditors interviewed students and

staff their findings show that on any

given day there would only be about 30

students in the building a fraction of

the reported 459 enrolled there oh it

gets worse because when an auditor

looked into it they found Kids Count had

done the legal minimum oversight

required which I would argue suggests a

problem with the legal minimum because

thirty kids showed up and the school

claims they had four hundred and fifty

which doesn't speak well of an oversight

group calling itself Kids Count now

though oh hi oh has passed a new law to

try and clean up some of the problems

you've seen but serious damage has

already been done and incredibly there

is one more way that charter schools

around the country have been allowed to

run wild because we haven't even

mentioned online charters yet they serve

a hundred eighty thousand students and

even if they just get the average seven

thousand dollars per student that's over

a billion dollars in taxpayer money

going to cyber charters annually and

some have an attendant system you would

not believe sometimes kids aren't

counted absent until they have failed to

log on for five days in a row

and some are never required to attend

class but the state still requires the

schools to report attendance so most

just report a hundred percent even

though that's

not what's really going on that's just

crazy you're basically giving kids a box

containing videogames pornography and

long division and claiming a hundred

percent of them chose the right one and

look some kids might need online

education but it has got to be monitored

better because one major study found

compared to kids in traditional public

schools students in online charters lost

the equivalent of 72 days of learning

and reading and 180 days in math during

the course of a 180 day school year and

180 - 180 is as those kids might put it

three now

charter advocates will tell you that

even they are concerned about online

schools and they'll argue some states

have much better oversight than the ones

that we've seen and that is true though

for the record some may even be worse

once you're a researcher told Ohio be

very glad that you have Nevada so you

are not the worst which I believe is the

motto on Nevada state licensed place but

the point is we don't even have time to

get into Nevada and advocates will argue

all these closings shall accountability

inaction just like in business bad

schools closed but there's a king

problem there as one former charter

school employee explains this isn't just

a regular business this isn't a

restaurant that you just open up you

serve your food people don't like it you

close it and you move on this is

Education this is students are getting

left in the middle of the year without a

school to go to so I just think that

there needs to be some filter as to

who's opening up these charter schools

exactly the problem with letting the

free market decide when it comes to kids

is that kids change faster than the

market and by the time it's obvious the

school is failing futures may have been

ruined so if we are going to treat

charter schools like pizza shops we

should monitor them at least as well as

we do pizzerias it's like the old saying

give a kid a shitty pizza you've got

their day treat a kid like a shitty

pizza you could cut their entire life

you

we'd like to talk about someone you may

not have thought about for a while the

Dalai Lama a man so enlightened he's

basically the original woke bei

according to a Gallup poll the Dalai

Lama is actually the sixth most admired

man in America and when you mentioned

his name to people in the streets

you can see how widely he's revered a

lot of respect inspiration from what he

says he says like Bloodgood quotes

here's some really great quotes about

life a lot of good things I guess he's a

peaceful man he's about peace okay so

he's peaceful admired and has some good

quotes that is pretty broad they could

be describing either the Dalai Lama or

Matthew McConaughey but what what

happens when those same people are asked

a simple follow-up what would you say

the guy

now I have no idea I'm not even alive I

don't know II just I'm not really sure

he's a very important figure for a

Buddhist God right no not a God he's a

better person he's a life he just said

oh like he owes the Dalai Lama

money he's alive oh I got to

disappear for a while that guy does not

around now the Chinese government

however have a very different view

because instead of vaguely loving the

Dalai Lama they very specifically hate

him they've referred to him as a wolf in

monk's robes and have banned his image

they've even retaliated against

Americans for even meeting with him

Britain's Guardian says China reportedly

banned Lady gaga

that's because she met with the Dalai

Lama in Indianapolis to discuss yoga Wow

not only is it incredible that they

banned her for that it's incredible that

that event happened at all Lady Gaga was

with the Dalai Lama in Indianapolis

discussing yoga that is only slightly

less ridiculous than Elton John meeting

ben bernanke on Easter Island to talk

about rumors now the Chinese

government's hatred of the Dalai Lama

stems from its desire to main control of

Tibet a region in southwest China and

Tibet was something of a celebrity cause

in the 1990s there were Tibetan freedom

concerts between the Beastie Boys and

Richard Gere even brought it up at the

Oscars that was when it was this kind of

if something miraculous and really kind

of movie like could happen here where we

could all kind of send love and and

truth and kind of sanity did Deng

Xiaoping right now in Beijing that he

will take his troops and take the

Chinese away from Tibet and allow these

people to live as free independent

people again

so but you send this thoughts send this

thought out send this thought we send

this thoughts we send it out right now

oh you know what I'm sorry there's been

a mistake the thoughts are actually

supposed to be sent to the producers of

moon lights this is not a joke

moon lights these thoughts are for you

[Applause]

take the thoughts but but there is a lot

about Tibet that you might not actually

know for a start it's larger than you

probably think

China say it's this area but Tibetan

exiles will say it's even larger

encompassing an area that is roughly a

quarter of China so it's very big in a

confusing way at which and this is true

is also how director Lars von Trier

characterized Willem Dafoe's dick

seriously he told reporters it's too big

everybody got very confused when they

saw it well I'm saying yes Tibet is the

Willem Dafoe's dick of planet Earth it

is surprisingly large the point is China

invaded Tibet in 1950 and ever since

they've imposed strict controls on the

institutions of Tibetan Buddhism their

temples and monasteries have been

destroyed and hundreds of thousands of

Tibetans have been killed and things

inside Tibet are still grim when Freedom

House scored countries and territories

for political rights and civil liberties

Tibet came in second worst behind Syria

and ahead of both Somalia and North

Korea the whole territory is a gross

human rights violation which is

interestingly another way that lars von

trier has described Willem Dafoe's penis

and perhaps the clearest sign of just

how bad conditions are is the fact that

since early 2009 a hundred and forty-six

Tibetans have self-immolated in Tibet

and China setting themselves on fire in

protest to which the Chinese police have

been less than sympathetic

[Music]

when the O'Laughlin German was on fire

Chinese producer came and he caught him

and bit him because Los Angeles on the

fires so the police closer you got on

fire so letters the police are demanding

the family to Los Angeles a family that

they needed a compensation for burning

of their own clothes well every part of

that is horrifying and China is

unlikely to loosen its grip on the

region Tibet has incredibly rich

resources from gold and lithium to River

supplying hydroelectric power and water

to over a billion people so they are

very sensitive to any perceived threat

to their control which brings us back to

the Dalai Lama traditionally he's been

both a spiritual and political leader of

Tibetan Buddhist sort of a cross between

a Pope and a president a pope Siddhant

if you will but you shouldn't so please

don't China has done everything they can

over the years to diminish his power he

even fled Tibet in 1959 under fear of

arrest and he hasn't been back since an

escape that was reported at the time by

the most British man who has ever lived

the young Dalai Lama revered by his

people as a living Buddha was reported

under arrest by the Rebbe's

but according to other sources is safely

in hiding one clear effect rebbe tyranny

is not wanted by these intensely

religious people

yes damn that unwanted creepy birds

tyranny down with those thieving

imperialists and goodnight to Her

Majesty's subjects in Bahrain Maltese

Rhodesia to make a Barbados Kenya and

Uganda

nighty night sleepy tight

for over fifty years

the Dalai Lama has lived in exile in

India and he's lived quite a life he's

met with the last four presidents and

when he was a child FDR gave him a

beautiful Patek Phillipe pocket watch

which he still has to this day and

George W Bush gave him an even greater

gift but painting his portrait these

portraits and I gave Bush his skills as

noticed the same review I give his time

as president not bad for a five-year-old

now

the dalai lama officially stepped down

from running the Tibetan

government-in-exile in 2011 but he's

still have profound importance to the

Tibetan people as a spiritual leader and

a figurehead and here here is where this

story gets absolutely amazing because

he's 81 years old so thoughts have

inevitably turned to his next

reincarnation but it turns out there's a

bit of a problem with that and let me

explain broadly speaking when the dalai

lama dies he reincarnates as a child

somewhere on earth and traditionally a

key person in the process of finding him

is someone called the panchen lama and

when the Panchen Lama dies the dalai

lama plays a similar role in finding him

and so on and so on

they're basically playing a buddhist

version of hide and seek

so the ninth panchen lama helped

identify the current Dalai Lama who in

turn identified this six year old boy as

the Panchen Lama but this is where it

starts to get tricky because that boy

has not been seen in more than 20 years

these are the last known pictures of

GERD and choking Nima the boy chosen to

be Panchen Lama the Chinese authorities

rejected his appointment arrested the

boy and his family it's true China

kidnapped a six-year-old and no one has

heard from him since although just two

years ago a senior Chinese official said

he is being educated living a normal

life growing up healthily and does not

wish to be disturbed which is a little

suspicious because it sounds like the

kind of thing a former child stars

publicist would scream into a phone

she's growing up healthy living a normal

life and those track marks on her arms

are just where they inject the vitamins

she's

she's fine but Jonah didn't stop it just

stealing the Panchen Lama if I had

another trick up their sleeve in an

attempt to discredit the Dalai Lama's

choice of one of tibet's top Buddhist

spiritual leaders Chinese officials used

a 200 year old ceremony to name their

own Pancham Lama

yes they made their own fake Panchen

Lama they basically counterfeited a

religious leader like a knockoff handbag

that doesn't say coach that says cough

and China's tactics here are obvious if

they control the Panchen Lama they can

use him to pick a new Dalai Lama who

might completely coincidentally be very

favorable to the Chinese government

meanwhile the Dalai Lama understandably

is pretty pissed off about this the

landing no I want to make clear there as

far as my own rebirth is concerned the

final authority is myself no one else

but obviously not Chinese colonists that

is some forceful language - he's

basically saying they can make that

decision over my dead body

except you know specifically not that

he's now actually saying that he will

either not reincarnate as the Dalai Lama

at all or if he does it won't be inside

Chinese control Tibet it will be

somewhere else which is incredible

because that means that when he dies we

could plausibly wind up with two rival

Dalai Lama's and the already fraught

situation in Tibet could spiral out of

control and for the time being there is

really only one person who can fill you

in on what is happening in the Dalai

Lama's head but he lives in India and

that is a 14 hour flight away and the

reason I know that is I went to speak to

the Dalai Lama in India enjoy

yes I travel to the Himalayan foothills

of Dharamsala India a journey that

involved considerably more uphill

walking cows and monkey traffic than

I've been led to believe all to talk

with the Dalai Lama about China

conditions in Tibet and what comes next

for him

you holiness it isn't honor to speak to

you may I say Tashi Delek

thank you how is my pronunciation - I

think we're good in my defense I just

started learning Tibetan 40 seconds ago

let's talk about China because the

Chinese government absolutely hates you

don't they yes publicly one government

official said you're a wolf wrapped in

monk's robes and photos of you are

forbidden in many places you don't to me

look like an evil wolf they just called

me sa demon you're a demon oh yeah then

I immediately yes I am demon with horns

yeah because that's the classic demon

right yes I think that's what I look at

you that's what they see oh why don't I

do one to say that's their freedom I

have no say no negative feeling I just

feel a laugh like that I practice you

see taking others anger suspicion

distrust and give them patience

tolerance and compassion I practiced

that but it seems the Chinese government

are particularly good at taking your

positivity turning it back into

negativity and oppression of the Tibetan

people they hand it back to you as it

was yes just outside the dalai lama's

temple is a local memorial honoring

Tibetans who self-immolated in protest

against Chinese oppression acts that put

him in a very difficult position this is

a hard question

well the self-immolation that has

happened or a hundred and forty Tibetans

yes

burned themselves it is very very sad

indeed yes why is it hard for you to

definitively tell them to stop doing it

this is I find a very difficult sort of

situation there right from the beginning

when I first heard that firstly i

express my solo or sadness then meantime

if I say their action is wrong then

their family they will they feel very

sad

what would our family member did

something against Inter Lamas wish right

I don't want to create that and then

certainly I cannot support that because

of the act of killing from Buddhist

viewpoint it's a self killing not good

so therefore my position is very very

difficult

so then best thing is remain silence to

quite the tango Lama is Priene fully

aware how powerful his words are and he

occasionally uses them in targeted and

sometimes surprisingly specific ways

like this example which he offered up

out of nowhere one will my previous

visit Mongolia is it they took lot of

vodka the Russians were hard ferocity

they like a drink yeah vodka then I

suggested drink much less vodka yeah I

love to hear instead of that you say

dead traditional drink horse milk wait

hold on hold me what you tried to wean

them off vodka by giving them horse milk

oh yes

then they follow what they really follow

since then say I think majority of

Mongolian no longer any drink hold on

that is a that is a huge claim you cured

Mongolia of alcoholism yes using horse

milk yes yeah not too late but the point

I'm just concerned I would see horse

milk and I think oh that came from a

horse

oh that's illogical once differences cow

milk and hospital one differences one

comes out of a cow the other I don't

know how you get it out of a horse I

know you just how to keep the party

going let's talk about a lighter subject

death you are going to die and when you

do it's going to be a massive problem

because there are issues regarding your

reincarnation regarding China I I do not

much done son what that by being cousin

is well-being of seven billion human

being and then preservation of rich

Buddhist tradition but which we kept but

you're intertwined with that no no it's

an individual person not much important

you know right but there is a loyal um

but Buddhism over two thousand since

early years still very much alike so do

you think you might be the last Dalai

Lama very possible you do yes you might

be if I become last dollar I feel very

happy what because you were a good one

oh yes I may say quite intelligent

oh you calling yourself intelligent so a

little bit of arrogance there as well if

you don't resolve your reincarnation

issue are you not worried that China

will appoint their own Dalai Lama and he

may not speak like you're speaking now

that also it may I say so yeah there's

also you see one of the foolish and

short-sighted China without using human

brain properly it's harmful that's that

is a guaranteed way to calm the Chinese

government down to tell them they're not

using the human brain properly I told

them our brain usually you see have the

ability to create common sense the

Chinese hardliners in their brain that

one brain is missing Z Chinese leaders

Chinese Communists they're very much

concerned about the image of China I'm

happy to sit here and criticize China

with you because I know the consequences

for me are not necessarily as bad as

they are for you so so I wish you see

they call me demon so I want another

demon so you become demon no no no you

can't transfer you can't reincarnate the

demon into me you cannot do that you

don't only do that SN de geneve Z oh no

this is not how I wanted this interview

today

so the Dalai Lama seems determined to

keep his reincarnation plans private for

the time being

leaving millions of Tibetans waiting for

an answer and as our time drew to a

close I wanted to cement our new

friendship you were given a watch by

President Roosevelt is that true yes

true at that time I think one cursor

better flip that's actually a beautiful

one pocket pocket watch right well I

have a special gift for you it is not a

beautiful watch from a president but it

is a special watch from me here it is

it's a calculator watch oh right

Roosevelt might have given you a fancy

watch but that is water-resistant

wonderful thank you Rosalie rosewood

watch I did old fashioned yeah this new

fashion well not so much new fashioned

as from the 1980s okay thank you

thank you think about thank you my demon

friend

[Laughter]

[Applause]

[Music]

our main story tonight concerns Facebook

the worst place to wish happy birthday

to a friend other than a funeral now

Facebook has been in the news a lot

recently over concerns about everything

from privacy to fake news to Russian

trolls but tonight we're actually going

to go in a different direction and focus

on his behavior overseas because

Facebook has been expanding aggressively

abroad more than half its revenue come

from outside the US and eighty percent

of its users now live in foreign

countries posting things like this yes

that is that's an international version

of the in my feelings challenge the

thing that took Facebook and Instagram

by storm after being popularized by the

Shiggy show and you can learn more about

all of that in my new book I don't know

what any of these words mean but my

staff assures me it makes sense for

years Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg

pushed his utopian idea that all

connections are good connections with

feel-good ads showing him bringing the

Internet to the world and Facebook

employees proudly saying things like

this by connecting the world people

realize that there are other people in

the world who have different lives in

them and that maybe their lives could be

better and then amazing things happen

you want to do something big and you

have this access to you know 1.2 billion

people what can you do is just limited

by your imagination look connecting

billions of people does sound great but

it's also important to remember that

when it comes to the Internet a certain

number of those people are then going to

say Jews control sharks who did 9/11 and

you really have to think that through

unfortunately thinking things through

has never really been Facebook strong

point there early motto was famously

move fast and break things a sentiment

which Zuckerberg has explained this way

we want to build our culture and our

infrastructure so that we just try to

move you know one or two clicks faster

than than other companies and you know

sometimes we go too fast and we mess up

a bunch of stuff and then we have to fix

it and that's cool is that cool is that

cool at all mark because that seems like

maybe the most reckless corporate motto

since the hindenburg companies fly fast

and smokes

and a big bag of hydrogen how did you

not foresee the problems that were

heading your way and make no mistake

Facebook has broken things overseas

sometimes they were small for instance

over the summer there was an earthquake

in Indonesia and while Facebook

undeniably connected people there it

wasn't necessarily in the way the

situation demanded as this international

news report shows normally Facebook

sends the balloon and the confetti

animations to users wishing each other

well however the Indonesian work for

congratulations selamat can also mean

unheard or to survive so when Facebook

users posted messages saying I hope

people will survive Facebook give them

celebratory animations yeah that's not

ideal is it because there's a time and a

place for balloons and it's very rarely

after the word survived in fact let me

prove that to you I have some terrible

news

we may have to eat each other to survive

no that's the worst time for that and

look look if if embarrasing

mistranslations were the only problems

that Facebook had that would be one

thing but the company has made some

hugely consequential mistakes overseas

and that is what tonight's story is

about in the Philippines and Cambodia

Facebook has been accused of empowering

authoritarians in Sri Lanka India and

Indonesia viral rumors and hateful

comments on Facebook have been linked to

outbreaks of deadly violence but for the

worst distillation of what Facebook can

do to a country just look at Myanmar the

country who thinks so little about you

didn't even realize that's not Myanmar

that's Mikhail Gorbachev's birthmark

this is Myanmar now Myanmar

also known as Burma was for decades cut

off from the world under military

dictatorships but in recent years as its

transition to a quasi civilian

government internet use there especially

a Facebook has exploded in 2013 just

over 1 percent of citizens had internet

access but now 18 million people are on

Facebook thanks in part to becoming

pre-installed on mobile phones and heavy

promotion by service providers who

didn't charge Facebook usage against

data plans yeah we can use Facebook for

free except for looking at photos and

watching videos everything is free we'll

use Facebook for free and ask the things

we want to know I'll use empty tea and

post everything to Facebook it's free

let's use Facebook for free with an PC

okay just quick question is Facebook

free cuz I'm worried that commercial

didn't quite make it clear so with

Facebook so easy to access it basically

became the internet so much so that

people in Myanmar use the terms internet

and Facebook interchangeably and look

some people there use Facebook for fun

that guy you saw earlier lives in

Myanmar while other people find it to be

a complete waste of time like this

irritating teacher everybody said easy

it's my phone playing games I hate I

hate I don't like it's a terrible look

likes boys Facebook is a toilet

pinenut okay I get that he's annoyed but

calling Facebook a toilet is a little

unfair to toilets because they make

go away whereas Facebook retains to

simulate your acquaintances and

reminds you have from seven years

ago or what allowing corporations to put

their in front of you what I'm

saying is there is a purity and

integrity to toilets that Facebook

seriously lacks but Facebook's issues in

Myanmar go well beyond distracted

teenagers because if you have glanced at

the not Trump section of the newspaper

at all recently you are probably aware

that Myanmar is a majority Buddhist

country with a long history of religious

and ethnic tensions particularly with

regard to the row hinge er a mostly

Muslim group in the western part of

Myanmar in 2017 and military executed a

brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing so

far about seven hundred and twenty-five

thousand role hinge about three quarters

of the population have fled to

Bangladesh to escape government troops

one estimate puts the death toll

conservatively at around 10,000 people

and to be clear Facebook didn't cause

that I feel comfortable saying it Mark

Zuckerberg not guilty together side in

Myanmar as of this taping but but and it

is a big but by all accounts Facebook

absolutely did inflame pre-existing

tensions there in fact a report on

Myanmar prepared by independent UN

investigators said Facebook has been a

useful instrument for those seeking to

spread hate and it is weird to hear

something that started out as frivolous

be described like that it's like if five

years from now you and investigators

called bubble tea and aggressive threat

to human rights holy I mean

honestly I never really liked it but

Jesus Christ

but hate speech against Muslims and

especially the brow hinge er flourished

on Facebook posted by military leaders

and politicians as well as prominent

Buddhist monks like Ashton were our two

- Muslims have a place here in Burma we

can't repeat his actual response its

r-rated but essentially he said Muslims

were defecating on Burma threatening its

very existence you don't like them very

much

image Ionian I don't accept them why -

because they're deceiving the world they

want to take over the whole country that

monk is so hateful he has actually been

called the Burmese bin Laden that's

right a Buddhist monk is known as the

Burmese bin Laden which is as jarring as

if you found out there's a Care Bear

known as the one who has to be

honest I always thought wish bear would

be the one who I mean look at it

that Beth Fox

lerato had hundreds of thousands of

followers on Facebook and he uses pages

to wreak havoc including spreading false

accusations that a Muslim business owner

had raped a buddhist employee a post

that helped instigate riots in the city

of mandalay in 2014 in which two people

were killed and around 20 others injured

and yet despite repeated warnings about

where our two facebook didn't get around

to banning him until earlier this year

and that is just one example of the

extent to which facebook became an echo

chamber of Islamophobia one local

official told reporters he was proud to

oversee a Muslim free village even

though he admitted he had never even met

a Muslim before adding I have to thank

Facebook because it is giving me the

true information in Myanmar and here is

what happened when ABC talked to people

in the streets there most local people

here get their news via Facebook and

judging by what people have told us they

are not getting the whole picture what

do you think about the

I think they are terrorists they are

they're making problems every time I

could gather information from Facebook

what does Facebook say they want to

occupy our land and our people that is

very very dangerous because no one

should be judged by the worst things

people say about them on Facebook

if I were judgment that you'd think I

was a cuck twit a prime example of why

abortion should be more readily

available and that I look like a

distressed bird in a pet shop trying

desperately to get your attention and I

ask you is any of that apart from that

last one really fair I would say no I

would argue not so so how the did

so much hate speech and violence

inciting content stay up for so long

because it's not like Facebook doesn't

have rules they have a lot of them their

own internal materials get into details

like which sort of anuses photoshopped

onto faces they're willing to allow this

is true they even cite graphic examples

such as this image of Trump with an anus

for a mouth that is apparently allowed

by the way because he is a public figure

Taylor Swift with anuses for eyes also

allowed for the same reason but this

image of kim jeong-hoon with an anus for

a mouth is apparently not okay because i

quote it also displays a sex toy

inserted into the anus but that still

leaves gray areas doesn't it for

instance what if I display a meatball

sub being inserted into that same mouths

anus is a meatball sub a sex toy could

you not argue that meatballs are the

anal beads of Italy and by the way Olive

Garden that slogan is free for you to

use

look you can have it it's yours and look

you can quibble you've been absolutely

quibble with where Facebook draws its

lines and the broader discussion of

private companies policing speech is an

important one but the point is Facebook

does have standards that are enforced in

a number of ways they have artificial

intelligence that automatically detects

some objectionable content and removes

it that they also rely on users like you

and me to flag objectionable content

which is then reviewed by human

moderators is something most social

media companies do and it is a thankless

job as you can see from this training

session run by a Content moderation

company in India here the person is not

naked but you can see their exxor shape

is visible now this lady's now here it's

very much obvious that intensely sees

focusing on but part the camera is

focusing on backpack it will fall under

nudity it's not proper nudity but it

will fall under nudity I'm sorry I'm

absolutely calling it that guy is

definitely focusing on the buttocks look

but as Facebook themselves will tell you

policing nudity is the easy part

what's harder is defining and spotting

misinformation hate speech and that is

what Myanmar has been drowning in and

Facebook system failed them at every

stage first they're AI didn't work

because Facebook's technology isn't

compatible with me and Mars Language

fonts which you know not great but fine

that just meant that they badly needed

Burmese people to flag content for them

but to do that it really might have

helped if things like their community

standards and reporting systems had been

in Burmese which they weren't until late

2015 which isn't great in the country

where almost no one speaks English just

imagine if Facebook Facebook's interface

here was in Burmese you would have no

way of knowing which button did was in

fact that's not even Facebook's

interface that's just a list of

dinosaurs ranked from most to least

and by the way Stegosaurus is

way too far down on that list

Stella Soros is basically the wish bear

of dinosaurs seriously that bear can get

it but but wait wait because it gets

worse even content that did get flagged

in Myanmar often didn't get taken down

and one reason with that may be that

Facebook had shockingly few Burmese

speaking content reviewers how many you

know I'll just let this Reuters report

to tell you back in 2014 they had one

person they hired a second in early 2015

they out sourced an operation they'd

been doing that for a while but they had

had no Burmese speakers at all until

2015 when they hired

- it's true first they had one then they

doubled it to two and through

outsourcing added two more so full and I

don't know what the exact right number

of Burmese speakers for Facebook is but

it probably shouldn't be possible for

the sum total of them to be decimated in

a tandem bike accident and it's not like

Facebook can plead ignorance or surprise

about any of this multiple civil society

groups and individuals tried to warn

them as far back as 2013 five years ago

that they face trouble in Miami and

Facebook itself now admits that they

move too slowly though Zuckerberg

insists that they're now making progress

they've hired 60 burmese speakers me

recently told members of congress that

they're looking for more we're hiring

dozens of more Burmese language content

reviewers because hate speech is very

language specific it's hard to do it

without people who speak the local

language and we need to ramp up our

effort there dramatically hate speech is

language specific it's a little weird to

hear a guy who's been universally lauded

as a genius and a visionary say

something that's completely obvious as

if it's a brand new idea to him it's as

if Steve Jobs called everyone together

for his brand new discovery mrs.

Doubtfire was just the dad in a costume

yeah we know Steve

did you not get that I thought you were

smart I don't trust my iPhone now but

for all his reassuring words many argue

that Zuckerberg still hasn't done nearly

enough hate speech is still widespread

on Facebook in Miami last month four

months after Zuckerberg promised to do

better

Reuters found more than a thousand

Burmese language posts attacking the raw

ginger and other Muslims that were still

on Facebook and short you could say well

come on Reuters was actively looking for

those but you know who else could do

that maybe a company worth 500 billion

dollars

Reuters doesn't have 500 billion dollars

their journalist doesn't even seem to

have a decent webcam get the man a

decent webcam Reuters his work is

important

and despite its 60 hole Burmese speakers

Facebook is still struggling with the

language there in fact earlier this year

their community standards were so badly

missed translated into Burmese that

instead of saying we take our role in

keeping abuse of our service seriously

they said we take our role seriously by

abusing our services and small things

like that really matter

even punctuation can change the meaning

of a sentence for example and this is

true Bill Cosby once wrote a book that

I'm guessing was meant to be called come

on people but they admitted the comma so

it read come on people and you know deep

down perhaps that's when we should have

known and look look I am NOT saying that

the challenges Facebook is facing and

not significant but for a company that

moves fast and break things they have

sure moved slowly in trying to

fix them and until they do it is

painfully obvious that everyone should

be treating anything on their site with

extreme skepticism and see Facebook for

what it actually is a fetid swamp of

mistruths and outright lies interspersed

with the occasional reminder of a dead

pet that's it that's what it is so

instead of producing a Dilek ads about

connecting the world at the very very

least Facebook should be producing ads

that prepare countries for how to deal

with their product or suggest something

like this hi we're Facebook we're

connecting the world

and we're coming to your country whether

you like it or not so there's one thing

about Facebook you should probably know

somewhere between eighty and a hundred

percent of what's on our site is

complete my Facebook

page is full of lies about how happy I

am my Facebook page say I go to yoga

I've been like three times my Facebook

page says I'm a 19 year old girl all my

photos are of me with a baby but I don't

have baby fun we at Facebook believe in

giving everyone a voice without worrying

too much about what that voice then

chooses to say I mean how bad could it

be I don't believe the Holocaust

happened Oh yikes can someone please

explain to me why what Charlie Rose did

was so wrong I wouldn't post that but

you can George Soros invented mosquitoes

Hillary Clinton created aids yeah I'm

sure about that there is only one all

sent winner moving back and forth very

fast look it's not our place to tell you

you're wrong we're about making

connections can you connect me to my

brother

sure can you connect me to coca-cola oh

we can absolutely do that

but I can limit am an animal sake go

get'em at that I mean familiar I'm not

sure what you just said but it sounded

great

the point is Facebook is a platform

anyone can use to do good or bad it's

riddled with and quite honestly

we're never gonna be able to control or

contain it

so before you use our site for the first

time there's something you badly need to

remember Facebook is full of first

of all it's full of

we spoke with Joseph Jam to best boogie

no Maris por nada

first mommy cam said mommy Facebook are

the rust disgusting got a lily left of

this book in a park so they like karma

so in my team band say ah

a toilet Facebooker Lupo konjam

Facebook's a toilet and God willing your

country will survive it

we've really gotta fix that Facebook

we're toilet

[Laughter]

[Applause]



[Applause]

you

The border, the boundary
that is incredibly tough

to smuggle a monkey across...
I am told.

-(MONKEY SCREAMING)
-Shh.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

President Trump has famously
made securing the border

a key priority
for his administration,

most notably
through his border wall,

something which, as we've
pointed out before,

he himself inadvertently found
a flaw in on the campaign trail.

There's no ladder
 going over that.

If they ever get up there,
 they're in trouble.

'Cause there's no way
 to get down.

Maybe a rope.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Yeah. Yeah. Maybe a rope.

And I know that sounds stupid,
but to be fair,

you haven't heard Phase Six

of Donald Trump's
border security plan,

"Go get me all the ropes."

And while that wall idea
has received a lot of coverage,

it is by no means
Trump's only border plan.

One of his more benign-sounding,
but potentially

no less dangerous, ideas
concerns the Border Patrol.

And first, let's be clear
about who they are.

They are part of Customs
and Border Protection.

They are not ICE, who you may
know from immigration raids.

They're also
not customs officers,

who you'll see at airports
and border crossings,

nor are they the Borders Patrol,
a group of vigilantes

who defend abandoned Borders
bookstores from raccoons.

No, the Border Patrol
are the people in green uniforms

who literally patrol
the boundaries of our country.

There are around 20,000 of them.

But Trump,
in an executive order,

has called for them to add
five thousand more,

to tackle the many problems
that he sees

on our southern border.

Let's stop the drugs
 and the crime

from pouring into our country.

You can certainly
 have terrorists,

you can certainly
 have Islamic terrorists,

you can have anything
 coming across the border.

We're gonna have a strong,
 strong, strong border

that people are gonna respect,
 and the drugs are not gonna be

flowing across like gravy.

Now, that right there,
is what happens

when Donald Trump starts
a sentence feeling xenophobic

-and ends it feeling hungry.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

"We need to stop Mexicans
coming in like hot fudge sundaes

coming into my tummy,
three scoops, whipped cream,

no cherry,
'cause I don't do fruit."

But-- but for the record,
Border Patrol agents

do a lot more than just fight
drugs, crime and gravy.

In recent years, the number
of Mexicans apprehended
crossing the border

has dramatically dropped
and has now been surpassed

by the sharp rise in migrants
fleeing violence

in Central America, for whom
there is a legal process
to seek asylum here.

Meaning that agents' days

can frequently include
moments like this.

NEWSCASTER:
 The Boccé family take
 their first tentative steps

into the United States
 of America.

Within seconds,
 the Border Patrol are on them.

There's no chase, no tension.
 They expected to be caught.

(MAN SPEAKS IN SPANISH)

NEWSCASTER: As we film,
 another two figures emerge,

a mother and her daughter.

They're given blankets
 to protect them from the cold.

And that's kind of not
what people expect

when they think of the border.

In the Venn Diagram
of hardened drug dealers

and people who need blankets,

that middle section
is pretty much just Linus.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Oh, I'm sorry, he is not
a drug dealer?

The messy hair,
the stripy shirt,

the thumb-sucking...
He sells ecstasy at raves,

and he's high on his own supply
all the time.

There is no Great Pumpkin,

he's a junkie,
someone intervene!

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

But-- but the truth is,
it is moments like that there,

that show how difficult the job
of a Border Patrol agent can be,

because in that moment,
they are delivering aid

and processing migrants,
but later, that same day,

they may be chasing down
drug traffickers.

So, it's a mixture
between humanitarian work

and law enforcement,
and not everyone can do it.

And that is what makes
Trump's plan

to expand the Border Patrol
by 25 percent so concerning,

because if you hire agents
quickly and badly,

it can actually leave us
much less safe

and have
devastating consequences.

And the reason we know this
is because we have been
down this road before.

So, tonight, I would like
to talk to you

about the last Border Patrol
hiring surge,

because it wasn't that long ago.

NEWSCASTER: After the so-called
 bungling of intelligence
 leading up to 9/11,

President George W. Bush
is determined to shore things up
 at the borders.

As part of that mandate,
 the Border Patrol expanded

from 10,000 agents to 20,000.

It's true. The late 2000s saw
a surge in Border Patrol agents

that was matched only
by the surge in the number

of reality shows about people
making cakes.

There were so many of those,
you don't even know

which one of them I made up.

It was, by the way,
 Cake Cucks...

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-...which, I guarantee you,

will be in production
some time next week.

Now-- now, to meet the surge's
ambitious targets,

recruitment was aggressive,

and the government advertised
everywhere,

even, at one point,
doing this...

NEWSCASTER: The Border Patrol
 spent 8.4 million dollars
 sponsoring this car,

getting it detailed
and staffing recruitment booths.

(CAR REVVING)

That is honestly true.
They sponsored a NASCAR team,

putting the Border Patrol
in such fine company

as other actual NASCAR sponsors,
Depend Underwear,

-and Boudreaux's Butt Paste.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

A product for, I assume,
people who want their butt

-pasted closed.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And look, that wasn't all.

They also ran slickly-produced
TV ads, like this...

ANNOUNCER:
As a mobile law enforcement arm

of the Department
 of Homeland Security,

it is the job
 of the Border Patrol

to prevent terrorists
 and terrorist weapons,

and all those who seek
 to do us harm,

from entering the United States.

(RADIO CHATTER)

ANNOUNCER:
 The Border Patrol.

We protect America.
 Are you up to the challenge?

You have to admit, they make
that job look very exciting,

although, in fairness,
anything said

in that tone of voice
would be exciting.

(DEEP VOICE) Here is my kitten.
I named him Bootsie.

Don't wee on the rug, Bootsie.

I'm not sure he likes me
as much as I like him.

(RESUMES REGULAR TONE)
But the truth of their job is

that most agents work alone,
patrolling vast swathes
of desert.

And whilst some days feature
bursts of action,

others can involve
absolutely nothing,

which can be challenging
in and of itself.

REPORTER:
 One of the larger problems...
 is boredom.

HEYMAN: It doesn't mean
 that it's never dangerous.

There are bandits out there,
 there are drug organizations
 out there.

What they're not really getting
is preparation for...

the boring, non-risky reality
of almost all of their career.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Exactly.

Boredom is a significant part
of life

as a Border Patrol agent.

And they should probably train
for it.

For every hour they spend
in target practice,

they should probably spend
ten hours watching
 Mozart in the Jungle.

Are you funny?
Am I supposed to care about you?

Who's that woman with the oboe?

I'm confused,
but I'm also bored.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

But-- but the big problem was
that as they doubled in size,

meeting and maintaining
their hiring quotas meant

that their screening process
wasn't always as strong

as it could have been.

It was only late in the surge
that the CBP

started giving applicants
polygraph tests,

something that most other
federal law enforcement
agencies do,

and to listen to James Tomsheck,
who headed Internal Affairs

for CBP through most
of the surge,

their findings indicated
they probably should
have done that sooner.

TOMSHECK:
The shocking discovery we found

was that more than half
 of the persons

who had cleared
 background investigations,

failed the polygraph
 examination,

the vast majority of them
providing detailed descriptions

of the criminal activity
 they had been involved in.

Now, just think about that.
Over half of CBP's applicants,

who had cleared
the highest level
of background check,

were found unsuitable
for service.

And some of what
they confessed to

was absolutely incredible.

One applicant admitted
to smoking marijuana

twenty-thousand times
in a ten-year period.

Kudos to that individual.

While another stated he had
"no independent recollection

of the events that resulted
in a blood-doused kitchen,"

and was "uncertain if he had
committed any crime

during his three-hour blackout."

Which, I'm gonna go ahead
and say,

yes, you did commit a crime,
or at the very least,

you really fucked up a soufflé.

I mean, you fucked
that thing up bad.

And the problems didn't stop
once the new agents were hired,

because the training was also
significantly cut back,

and that caused real issues,
as one trainer revealed,

while, for some reason,

being disguised
as an asthmatic scarecrow.

REPORTER: We are disguising
 the face and voice

of this veteran agent
 and training instructor,

because of fears of retaliation.

AGENT:

So, the standards were lowered?

AGENT:

-What is happening there?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

He sounds like Jesse Ventura
after swallowing one of those

novelty cow-voice noise makers.

And look, I know that it is
really hard to pay attention

to what Robot Neil Young
is saying there,

but it is genuinely
worth listening

to where they cut corners.

REPORTER: The source told us
 Spanish-language classes

and physical training
 were cut back.

AGENT:

They cut back on Spanish
and physical training,

so the new standards affected
agents' ability

to talk to the people
they caught

and their ability
to catch the people
they wanted to talk to.

Which seem like pretty essential
facets of their job.

It's like if the training
program at SeaWorld left out

putting on a wetsuit
and systematically driving

carnivorous whales insane.

That's the whole job there!

Take them away, you're left
with nothing else!

And consequently,
as the ranks grew,

corruption and excessive force
sky-rocketed

and misconduct became
such a problem

that, at one point,
the Border Patrol felt it needed

to issue a memo about the fact
their agents

"were averaging two alcohol-
related arrests per week,"

and some agents off-duty
run-ins with the law

were even more spectacular.

BARBARA LEE-EDWARDS: Tonight,
 two Border Patrol agents

are on leave after a woman
 says they put on a lewd show

during Cirque du Soleil,
 performing a sex act

right in front of children.

The accusations
don't stop there.

The couple is suspected
of being drunk and violent.

(CHUCKLING) Wow!

Now, I should tell you,
one agent was found guilty

of assaulting the woman
who complained,

but both denied that anything
sexual was happening,

and they were found not guilty
of the sex act,

presumably because they were
at Cirque du Soleil,

where everything looks
like a sex act.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-I'll show you.

This... is a sex act.

This is a sex act.

This is a wildly difficult
sex act.

That is a bird person sex act.

And I have absolutely no idea
what's happening there,

but I think it's the thing
Steve Bannon is supposed
to be good at.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
AND CLAPPING)

And things got-- things got
more serious than that.

Since 2005, 77 agents
were arrested or indicted

for corruption, and if you think
about it,

Border Patrol agents
are particularly attractive

to drug-traffickers.

Remember, they often work
on their own,

patrolling the border,

which, as one journalist
points out,

is a pretty potent recipe
for trouble.

One Border Patrol agent
 can undo an incredible amount

of good that all the other
 Border Patrol agents do.

One Border Patrol agent
 can wave in tons of drugs.

And, you know--

Literally. Absolutely literally.

Yeah! This is one
of the only cases

where someone saying
"a ton of drugs"

actually means a literal ton
of drugs.

No, Kevin, you did not do
"a ton of drugs,"

you took a Benadryl,
you made out with a goldfish,

and you passed out with
your head in the dishwasher.

Pull your life together.

And look, let me give you
just a taste of the kind

of spectacular corruption
involved.

Take Agent Joel Luna,
who, it turned out,

had a brother in the Gulf Cartel
and who was convicted

of engaging in organized crime

with some
pretty striking evidence

emerging during a house search.

INVESTIGATOR:
 We end up finding a safe,
 a black safe.

We found 89,000 dollars
 in cash.

ROOT:
 Joel Luna's commemorative
 Border Patrol badge,

kilo and a half of cocaine,
 methamphetamine,

a gun that's tied directly
 to the Gulf Cartel,

it says "Gulf Cartel" on it.
It's hard to explain that away.

It's hard to explain
why your Border Patrol badge

is in a safe with cocaine,
money and a cartel pistol.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Yeah.

That is really hard to explain.

I mean, the best I can do
is, uh,

"My badge had a drug problem
that it couldn't bear

to tell me about, so finally,
it decided to shoot itself

with a gun that we found
on a case,

planning to die surrounded
by its money

because its views on death
resemble those
of Ancient Egyptians."

But even then, we are talking
about a sentient police badge

with an interest in Egyptology,
so you're already banking

on a pretty large suspension
of disbelief there.

Oh, and you should know,

Luna was hired during the last
recruitment surge.

And CBP will tell you
what they told us,

that while some agents did
disgrace the badge
with corruption,

the vast majority did not.

Although, it is worth knowing
that Tomsheck,

the Internal Affairs guy,

believes the problem
is much bigger than they imply.

Mr. Luna is not one bad apple.

He is part of
 a raid of corruption

that exceeded that of
 any other U.S. Federal
 law enforcement agency.

Okay, so it's less
"one bad apple,"

than, "Oh, my God.
That is a lot of bad apples."

Which, by the way, should really
be the marketing theme

for red delicious apples.

"Red delicious apples...

Well, at least we got
the 'red' part right!"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And it gets even worse.

Because remember,
these agents have guns.

And some have made
very bad decisions.

And you may have seen coverage
of some of the tragic incidents.

MAN: In a string of shootings
 by the Border Patrol

that have stirred up emotions
 at the border,

there's one case in particular

that has become
 a rallying cry for justice.

A shooting of a 16-year-old boy
 named

Joe Antonio Elena Rodriguez.

They say their agents
were threatened by somebody

throwing rocks on
this side of the fence.

But standing here,
the first thing you ask yourself

is, "Could a 16-year-old boy
really threaten somebody

standing on top of what's
at least a 20-foot cliff?

And on the other side
of that fence?"

I mean, yeah.
That does seem pretty unlikely.

And to explain why,
tune in next week

when our main story will be
"Gravity...

Arch-nemesis
to the concept of up."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now, so you know,

that case is still
in the courts.

And agents can sometimes feel
threatened by rock throwers,

but it is worth pointing out
that a report which looked at
25 cases

where Border Patrol agents
shot people who'd thrown rocks,

concluded that "too many cases
do not appear to meet

the test
of objective reasonableness

with regard to the use
of deadly force."

Which I believe is kind of
law enforcement legalese for

"Holy shit! You shot some people
you should not have
fucking shot at.

-Maybe don't do that as much."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Oh, and there is one more thing
about the agent

in that fence shooting...
that will not surprise you.

He was one of those persons
hired by, uh, the Border Patrol

-during the surge.
-Of course he was.

And yet, despite all of these
warning signs,

we are about to embark
upon another ambitious

Border Patrol hiring surge.

And CBP will tell you
not to worry about that,

that in recent years
they've improved hiring
and made reforms.

For instance, they've slightly
increased transparency

and given agents more
non-lethal weapons

like pepper spray guns,

as well as rewriting
the use of force rulebook to,

and I quote, "prohibit
the shooting of suspects

fleeing the scene who do not
pose a threat to themselves
or others."

And look, that is great,

although it does seem
to be one of those rules

that you shouldn't have
had to write down.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-If you went to a zoo,

and there were a giant sign
that said,

"Please don't finger
the armadillos,"

you would wonder
what the fuck had happened

-before that sign went up.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CLAPPING)

But the problem is,
many other reforms
have not been made,

and it is hard to believe
that they will be

now that President
Gravy Drugs is in charge.

In fact, worryingly,
there has already been talk

that hiring standards
might drop again

with suggestions like
a shorter polygraph,

or removing parts of
the entrance exam.

And most frustratingly of all,
there may be no reason for us
to take this risk,

because a report from
the Inspector General
For Homeland Security

questions whether we even need
5,000 more Border Patrol agents.

And yet, Trump seems determined
to do this anyway.

Who knows why?

There is a fairly good chance
he only said 5,000

because someone told him
five bazillion is not
a real number.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And look,
whatever your feelings...

about the laws the Border Patrol
have been given to enforce,

and I have plenty
of feelings on that,

you do want the best possible
people enforcing them,

because if you don't,
as we have seen,

bad things happen.

This is a story about the danger

of not learning from
your mistakes.

And for the sake of
absolutely everybody,

people on both sides
of the border,

and the good
Border Patrol agents

just trying to do
a difficult job well,

if we are going to hire
all these new people,

the very least we can do is be
more careful this time around.

And one tiny step would be
to have recruitment ads

that show potential agents
what the job is really like.

ANNOUNCER: The Border Patrol.

We protect America.

And we're hiring... again.

But this time,
 we're gonna do it right.

So if you're looking for
 an exciting,

heart-pounding adventure,

maybe go skydiving
 or try parkour,

or do whatever the fuck this is.

But the Border Patrol
 may not be for you.

Because a lot of the time
the job looks less like this...

And more like... this.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

ANNOUNCER: That's right.

Just you, the desert,
 and nothing for miles around.

(BIRD CAWS)

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

ANNOUNCER: This could be
 your lunch break.

This is a job that could combine
 hours of boredom

with sudden bursts of action.

AGENT: Oh, shit!

I got people moving.
I need backup!

(CAR ENGINE REVVING)

ANNOUNCER:
 And about that action...

it definitely can involve
 people entering illegally,

or drug smugglers.

But a surprising
 amount of the time,

it involves desperate migrants
 for whom you're the first
 point of contact

in a system ill-equipped
 to cater to their needs.

(AGENT MUMBLING)

These guys... here.

I don't...

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Shit.

ANNOUNCER:
 This job is not for everyone.

And that's why this time,

we're not advertising
 with NASCAR.

Instead, we're recruiting with
 this sweet-ass Honda Odyssey.

A practical car for
 reasonable, methodical people.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)

ANNOUNCER: Please make sure
 you read the entirety

of this nuanced text
 before making any decisions.

And some of it's in Spanish,

because it would be
 really useful

if you could speak that.

But just to be clear, if you
wanna fuck at Cirque du Soleil,

this is not the job for you.

And we will find out.

Last question, have you ever...
and I mean ever

considered having
sexual relations

at a performance of
exotically dressed

Canadian acrobats?

No.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

We're done here.

ANNOUNCER: The point is,
if you're kind, physically fit,

impervious to bribery
 or boredom,

and you want to
 serve your country

by enforcing a controversial
 and ever-changing

set of policies in the most
 humane way possible,

then give us a call:
 The Border Patrol.

We're hiring!
 Wish us luck with that.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Circus-fuckers need not apply.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

China the country responsible for huge

technological advances and yet it still

can't seem to get pandas to china

is a gigantic and consequential country

where roughly one out of every five

people on earth live it is also the

place that trump has been ranting about

for years China is killing us what

China's doing to us is horrible China

cheats they devalue their currency we

can't continue to allow China to rape

our country and that's what they're

doing okay so even in the context of a

metaphor the word rape is pretty jarring

as verbs go it's not exactly bandied

about it's like if Trump said Congress

is really toe me on this border

wall the underlying point is clear what

he chose to express it that way is not

and yet for all that Trump talks about

China it seems that he's very much in

the process of learning about it just

watch what happened when microphones

picked up this exchange with China's

president during a state visit back in

November actually learned something

there rest assured the only thing you

took away from that conversation was

that Egypt is older and therefore less

though China okay great note to

self don't a gyp t' too old but the

truth Erie's a lot of us are probably

under informed about China and that's

something that its leaders have

historically been absolutely fine with

Deng Xiaoping famous we had a lay low

International Strategy summed up by the

same hide your strength and bide your

time but in recent years there has been

a significant shift regarding that

because when China's current leader Xi

Jingping

assumed the highest office in the land

he said this kumoi shock and awe that

China needs to learn more about the

world the world also needs to learn more

about China you know what he's right we

probably should talk more about China we

should probably have talked more about

it on this show especially considering

we've done roughly 4,000 different

stories on New Zealand and multiple

pieces on

testicle receptacle from the 2005

Russell Crowe film Cinderella man so so

tonight tonight let's talk about China

and let's put America aside for most of

this piece and talk instead about China

on its own terms because it's been going

through seismic social economic and

political changes which have happened

head-spinning Lee quickly and many of

them Center on its leader Xi Jinping who

just recently tightened his grip on

power

the most dramatic political change in

China in decades a vote to scrap term

limits for China's president the move

clears the way for Xi Jinping to stay in

power indefinitely and possibly for life

of nearly three thousand ballots only

two voted against the unprecedented move

three thousand to two which means after

that vote there were two members of

Chinese Parliament thinking whoopsy you

really thought that would go the other

way maybe an edible arrangement will

smooth things over with the man who's

now emperor for life and that followed

on the heels of what was arguably an

even bigger change the fact that last

October

she's political doctrine known as Xi

Jinping thought was enshrined in the

party's constitution and that may not

sound like much to you but it's roughly

the equivalent of Donald Trump making

himself a founding father and including

Donald Trump thought into the

Constitution which would mean that

historians in the future would have to

pass the meaning of while Bette Midler

is an extremely unattractive woman I

refuse to say that because I always

insist on being politically correct

and she's consolidation of power has

been aided by the fact that unlike many

of his predecessors who tended to be

dull bureaucrats he's gone out of his

way to form a cult of personality about

himself for a time state media called

him she Dada or uncle she both of which

are objectively weird names for an adult

to call another another adult but

fantastic names for a pair of hairless

cats see Dada uncle she dinner's ready

creepy weirdos

and she carefully presents eight

man-of-the-people image his origin story

is famous in China are born into an

elite family his father fell from grace

and like many during Mao's Cultural

Revolution she was sent to work in a

rural village a place which has now

become a tourist trap the smartly

dressed tour guide shows us where she

slept an old picture on the wall we see

a well he helped dig and a sewing shop

he set up old farmers who knew she back

then still roam about these pseudo

mascots of this Bazaar theme park yeah

that is a bazaar theme park and I'll say

that knowing full well that this

country's most beloved theme park

features vomit-inducing teacups and a

massive pantsless sailor duck with no

genitals and she's branding isn't

confined to tourist attractions state

media has also featured folksy moments

like this video of him ordering pork

buns at a Beijing restaurant now that

visit was huge news in China and that

could be hard to believe because our

politicians eat junk food in front of us

all the time you can find photos of 12

of the last 12 presidents shoving ice

cream into their faces it's actually

legitimately challenging to find a

single photo of Obama where he is not

about to inhale half a pint of vanilla I

didn't even remember that he'd been

demolishing a waffle cone during the bin

Laden raise but clearly I'd remembered

it wrong I was wrong but but the reasons

for Xi's popularity go beyond marketing

himself as a cuddly XI data that you can

grab a pork bun with because for

starters he is riding an economic wave

that long precedes him over the last 30

years China's GDP growth has averaged

nearly 10 percent a year making it the

fastest sustained expansion by a major

economy in history which has enabled

more than 800 million people to lift

themselves out of poverty and many in

China's growing middle class are pretty

content with how things have been going

the tremendous public optimism is

striking everyone is doing better than

their parents did in their day I think

we'll be able to move to a bigger house

within the next 5 years and I expect my

life to improve a lot whatever happens

I'm very optimistic about the future Wow

a sense of optimism about the future

I've got a say as a British person I

just find that utterly incomprehensible

if you look up optimism in the OED and

this is true the definition simply reads

no so for many in China

things are going undeniably well but she

has even greater ambitions and I'd like

to focus on two massive signature

projects one global and one domestic

first there's his so-called belt and

road initiative a plan which is

absolutely gigantic in scope basically

involves China spending a trillion

dollars on infrastructure projects in

more than 60 countries things like ports

bridges and roads with the idea that it

could eventually span international land

and sea routes and reshape global trade

with China at its center to hear China

tell it it is the most ambitious

infrastructure project in modern history

they've even produced an

english-language propaganda video to

tell the whole world about it

[Music]

okay if I could just if I could just

interrupt this irritating Old Navy

commercial Hawking a trillion dollar

infrastructure plan I know I know that

you're probably thinking right now if I

have to listen to one more second of

that it's going to be stuck in my head

all week well just be thankful that you

haven't heard the rap break until now I

can't take it anymore

either they basically made communist

kars4kids that is too early to say

whether the belt and road is going to be

a success but she's second bold project

has already seen results because he's

undertaken a massive crackdown on

political corruption a long-standing

grievance among Chinese citizens it's

led to the investigation and punishment

of hundreds of thousands of government

officials some at the very top of the

party and this has been widely

celebrated with the state media even

producing a crackdown themed computer

game the People's Daily a Communist

Party mouthpiece released a computer

game where users can give electric

shocks to corrupt officials what could

possibly be sinister about being invited

to electrocute prisoners in a

government-issued game that is the most

entertaining way to package something

disturbing since FDR smash-hit board

game Candyland just kidding it's a

japanese-american internment camp and

this this is where we reach the point of

the story that you're kind of knew was

coming because so far everything that

I've shown you is what she data wants

you to know about China but there is a

lot of troubling stuff under the surface

for instance conveniently for she some

of those swept up in the corruption

purge were his political rivals and

those accused were often funneled into a

system that's been described as a

secretive extra legal process where

interrogators seek to extract

confessions sometimes through torture

and it's worth knowing that those term

limits that he successfully eliminated

were put in place for a pretty good

reason specifically to avoid another

maou under whose regime some horrific

things happened in China from a

collectivized farming attempt that was

responsible for at least 45 million

deaths - a Cultural Revolution that was

estimated to have killed at least

another million - his belief that this

swimsuit was flattering which I realize

now that I say out loud really doesn't

belong with the other two in that list

the point the point here is she is

actively removing the post male

guardrails that were put in place and

while China has never exactly been known

as a haven for free expression

he has clamped down noticeably on any

form of dissent whatsoever there is

dissent online and China's censors are

working hard to quash it they

temporarily ban the use of phrases such

as personality cult and my Emperor and

also references to Winnie the Pooh a

character long used to mock Xi Jinping

based on an apparent resemblance

apparently Xi Jinping is very sensitive

about his perceived resemblance to

Winnie the Pope and I'm not even sure

it's that strong a resemblance to be

honest but the fact he's annoyed about

it means people will never stop bringing

it up trust me she if your face even

remotely resembles that of a beloved

cartoon character the smart move here is

to lean in and backing down on Winnie

the Pooh comparisons

doesn't exactly project strength it

suggests a weird insecurity in him and

experts say that she is deeply concerned

the public opinion will turn on him

China's economy is already slowing and

she's reportedly haunted by the specters

of the Arab Spring and the Soviet

Union's collapse and that paranoia

may be why he's so anxious to

micromanage Chinese daily life the

government has a list of untrustworthy

people which can restrict citizens

ability to travel buy a house or take

out loans and over the next few years

there are plans to take things much

farther every Chinese citizen is being

assigned a social credit score a

fluctuating rating based on a range of

behaviors it's believed their community

service

buying Chinese made products can raise

your score fraud tax evasion and smoking

and non-smoking areas can drop it

if a score gets too low a person can be

banned from buying plane and train

tickets real estate cars and even

high-speed Internet yeah you could be

cut off from a high-speed Internet

although that could actually be a huge

opportunity for the finest purveyors of

shitty low-speed Internet

I'm talking of course about AT&T as of

this week our parent company so goodbye

everyone it's been fun it gets much much

darker here in fact she's crackdown on

human rights he's apparently the most

intense since Tiananmen Square and that

is not good because Tiananmen Square is

on the short list of places so infamous

you don't even need to describe what

happened like Chernobyl or Jonestown or

that one Cheesecake Factory we can't go

to anymore and she has intensified

government suppression of certain

religions in one province

Christians have been told to take down

the image of Jesus and Hank portraits of

she instead something I've also done by

the way so yeah I think it really ties

the room together it's a nice accent

piece and a Muslim population known as

we guys have been singled out for

dystopian levels of surveillance and

persecution here is one man talking

about a form that the government had him

fill out this piece of paper was sent to

everyone people had to fill it out

they asked things like if you are weaker

if you have a job if you have a passport

if you pray all these answers were

turned into a scoring system they would

categorize people into safe regular and

unsafe people that's pretty chilling cuz

generally speaking whenever people are

placed on lists it's not really turned

out well for anyone involved many of

history's greatest monsters put people

on lists Nixon the Nazis Santa all of

these animals did that I looked sure

enough if you are deemed unsafe for

whatever reason you're in big trouble

because China has incarcerated Muslims

in reeducation camps with as many as

800,000 individuals in facilities which

reportedly

to rewire the political thinking of

detainees arrays their Islamic beliefs

and reshape their very identities making

uncle Shi less like your fun uncle and

more like your creepy uncle who

imprisons 800,000 people in his

basements and if you want to see what it

looks like when she's jumping thought

gets put into Xi Jingping practice just

just take the story of Nobel Peace Prize

winner huge elbow he was imprisoned in

2009 for writing a pro-democracy

manifesto and last summer he died in

state custody and even China seemed

concerned about how that might look

fearing domestic backlash government

censors went to work social media post

mentioning Liu's name were deleted

online searches with his name were

blocked even simple candle emojis were

deemed illegal on some sites CNN signal

in China has been cut by government

censors every time we mention his name

exactly the Chinese media wouldn't allow

mentions of a Nobel Peace Prize winners

name which is a pretty intense level of

censorship but it's also my personal

policy towards Guatemalan activists

Rigoberta menchú do not bring her up

around me she knows what she did you

know what you did Rigoberta you know

what you did I don't hear our name on

your lips that's not what this meetings

about

but the point is what it is what

happened to you she'll bo and his wife

who is still under house arrest is

absolutely tragic although to his credit

he didn't go down without taking a final

swing one of the last known photos of

Lee you was with his wife Lucia at first

glance unremarkable but notice the mugs

they're holding yep

that's really the true

good for that chuckling I think deep

down we all know when you need to really

tell someone to go themselves

why not do it with a mark what the hope

the whole point here is under Xi

Jingping China is becoming more

authoritarian just as it has major plans

for expansion onto the world stage so

the era of hide and bide is over and the

era of do as we say may be dawning

because China has significant economic

leverage and it has been using that to

silence criticism even when criticism is

very much warranted the European Union

hardly squeaks about human rights

anymore or certainly the British don't

you don't get much on Tibet either

because whenever anyone raises any of

these issues China turns around and says

do you want to do business or not of

course because China knows no matter how

badly they behave the world will still

want to do business with them they're

like Facebook oh I'm sorry you don't

like us mining your data and

undercutting your democracy what exactly

are you gonna do about it

male people printed out photos of your

meals you ate call your friends and tell

them happy birthday and out loud words I

don't think so go yourself

here is where having set America aside

at the start we should bring it back in

because it is arguably more important

than ever than America be strategic and

tactical about how to deal with China

sadly those qualities are not hallmarks

of this guy who couldn't play chess for

longer than 29 seconds without screaming

my horse eats your big lady and pouring

nacho cheese all over the board

Trump is blowing up the traditional

alliances that have helped influence

Chinese behavior on important issues and

that has been great news for Xi Jinping

as has the fact that human rights don't

really seem to be a big trump priority

in fact just hours after the death of

you gel polo

even has it as his administration issued

condolences Trump himself said this

president she is a terrific guy I like

being with him a lot and he's a very

special person Wow

that was not the best time to give Xi

Jinping a pat on the back it's the

equivalent of saying how much you love

Kevin Spacey in American Beauty right

now first you shouldn't it was

objectively terrible and second you're

picking the worst possible time to bring

that up

the point is Trump is leaving a vacuum

on the world stage and China is more

than happy to fill it by telling the

world its story and leaving out some

very important details so for everyone's

benefit if they're going to send out

cuddly propaganda videos about Xi

Jinping at his achievements someone

might want to make a companion piece the

kind of rounds out the picture

[Music]

[Applause]

taina bandung now it's growing big enjoy

let's learn about it now in this

annoying hum they have a president so

call him uncle she bunny can with

you instead

[Music]

he'll add a shield for you

[Music]

you

[Applause]

I would like to talk about doctors there

among our most trusted professionals

nearly 70% of us write them highly on

ethical standards our lives and

occasionally our balls are in their

hands which is why it was especially

troubling last week to see this with his

syndicated TV show magazine and website

dr. oz has become one of America's most

trusted Doc's but on Capitol Hill

Tuesday he was on the hot seat excuse me

but any seat dr. oz is sitting on is the

hot seat so what did the doctor do they

criticized the talk-show hosts for

describing untested weight loss

supplements as magical or miraculous I

want you write it down Garcinia cambogia

because it may be the simple solution

you've been looking for to bust your

body fat for good now I've got the

number-one miracle and a bottle to burn

your fat lightning in a bottle

it's a miracle flower to fight fat

miracle flowers are you a doctor or an

Old West traveling salesman and I got

something miraculous for you ladies and

gentlemen and monkeys pour mixed with

five petals of a rose and a thimble full

of otter semen guaranteed to cure your

lumbago step right up step right over

here the Senate hearing was about the

marketing of dietary supplements and

unfortunately no one is more effective

at that than dr. oz Oz's advice is so

influential that one mention of a

product can cause sales to skyrocket the

phenomenon even has its own name dr. oz

effect after dr. oz touted a substance

called green coffee bean extract one

company in Florida sold half a million

bottles well what what's so wrong with

that name me one case where a man named

oz claimed mystical powers and led

people horribly as

namely one case you can't do it the only

problem with the dr.oz effect is that

magic pills don't technically exist and

dr. oz knows that do you believe that

there's a miracle pill out there there's

not a pill that's gonna help you

long-term lose weight and live your best

life without diet and exercise do you

believe there's a magic weight-loss cure

out there it the word Metin if you're

selling something because it's magical

no that would be ridiculous no one is

claiming there's a magic pill out there

that would be stupid

this little bean has scientists saying

date time and magic weight-loss cure for

every body type see he never said there

was a magic pill he said there was a

magic bean that's clearly entirely

different because magic beans are a very

real thing that you tried to cow for so

you can steal a golden heart from a

giant that's science and by the way a

recent study found the main ingredient

in those magic beans not only fails to

help lab mice it gave them the early

symptoms of diabetes though if you're a

lab mouse with diabetes you got off easy

good luck getting any sympathy in the

lab mouse support group oh I'm sorry you

can't have any candy I've got an ear

growing out of my back Jeff's

got herpes sorry Jeff his his mission

dr. oz is a doctor and one word degrees

from two Ivy League schools

he's also dangerously likeable watch how

morning joe reacted after seeing bits of

his congressional testimony i live up in

once it didn't can I just say for us I

like duck

I will confirm or deny like I'm a lot

like diners coming here with really good

advice rated by nod and listen if he's

got magic coffee beans I want some of it

you just showed a report that implied

they didn't work he basically just in an

emperor's new clothes piece and they

ended it by saying by the way the

Emperor's tailor was incredible that guy

can stitch and to give dr. Ross the

benefit of overwhelming medical doubt he

seems to be standing by some of his

claims I actually do personally believe

in the items that I talk about in the

show I passionately study them I

recognize that oftentimes they don't

have the scientific muster to present as

fat but that's the whole point you're

presenting it as a doctor if you want to

keep spouting this that's fine

but don't call it your show dr. oz call

it check this out with son God

knows Mehmet just

title to be fair the problem is this

Senate hearing is going to achieve

nothing for a very chilling reason

beyond embarrassing dr. oz there's very

little that Congress can do in this

arena it is the Federal Trade

Commission's job to go after online

scams and even they Yale can only

scratch the surface she's right dr. oz

is just a symptom of the problem the

disease is the fact that dietary

supplements in the US are shockingly

unregulated there are two agencies who

theoretically oversee things the FTC and

the FDA the FTC is supposed to regulate

the marketing of supplements but by

their own admission they give great

deference to the FDA on whether a

company's health claim can be supported

the problem with that is the FDA has

little authority to investigate the

contents of supplements until people are

already getting sick from them that

sounds crazy and in the past they

actually tried to change this in the

late 1980s 38 people died from

l-tryptophan supplements and in response

the FDA tried to expand its authority

how did that go

in 1993 the industry struck back

consumers were urged to write to their

congressman or told they may have to

kiss their vitamin C goodbye so did

people write to their congressman more

people wrote to Congress about the

supplement bill then wrote about the

Vietnam War

what how good must the pro-vitamin

protest songs have been ginseng huh what

is it good for sexual dysfunction of

type two diabetes

so you Daniel actually there were

actually no protests on but there were

PSAs put out by the supplement industry

featuring not just jackbooted thugs

coming to take your vitamins but a

surprise celebrity cameo breathe hey

guys it's only vitamins if you don't

want to lose your vitamins make the FDA

stop call the US Senate and tell them

that you want to take your vitamins in

peace if enough of us do that it'll work

Oh 1993 it was a different time

when you could plausibly say hey be

quiet everybody

let's all listen to what Mel Gibson has

to show and the supplement industry

didn't just pay for ads they gave money

to lawmakers like Republican senator

Orrin Hatch and Democratic Senator Tom

Harkin this was then back then they

actually became the two top recipients

of funds from the industry and in a

crazy coincidence they co-sponsored a

bill to deregulate it I send to the desk

a substitute amendment on behalf of

senators hatch and Harkin today we

honored the wishes of 100 million people

consumers of dietary supplements people

who simply want the ability to lead

healthy lifestyles without the constant

intervention of one tiny agency which is

possessed by a regulatory zeal equaling

none regulatory zeal he just criticized

a regulatory agency for being too into

regulating things that's like accusing

your podiatrist of having a foot fetish

dude dude dude you you're obsessed with

feet it just tone it down a bit now the

supplement industry will claim that it

is one of the more highly regulated

industries see how true you think that

is because if you're a supplement

company today you do not need approval

from the FDA before a product is

marketed you can make health claims

without prior approved

all from the government and you don't

have to prove the safety or

effectiveness of your products before

putting it up for sale the industry is

essentially supposed to police itself

that's not one of those porn sites that

asks you to enter your own age which

basically just ends up teaching children

how to subtract 18 from the current year

it doesn't work which may explain why

since 1994 the supplement industry has

gone from making four billion dollars to

thirty two billion dollars a year with

almost no side effects people who

consume tainted dietary supplements have

suffered from negative side effects like

severe bleeding strokes liver damage or

even death health officials say the

common item linked to several recent

cases of acute liver failure in Hawaii

is oxyelite pro Orioles pitcher Steve

bechler who died after taking a federer

during last spring training ephedra

stayed on the market an extra two years

after many experts asked for a ban

meantime the number of deaths rose to

155 with 16,000 adverse events wow

that's enough to make you wish for an

agency with a certain amount of them

what's the phrase regulatory zeal and

yet lawmakers still resist regulation

because when two years ago a bill was

proposed suggesting supplements should

carry warning labels about potentially

dangerous side effects you'll never

guess who popped up again the FDA

already has a tremendous amount of

regulatory oversight and enforcement

tools when it comes to dietary

supplements every supplement has a label

has the ingredients and the potency by

law on every single item that is sold as

a supplement that's right Hatchin harken

who in 2012 had retained their title of

the top two recipients of campaign funds

from the supplement industry see two

decades later those campaign

contributions still working

who says nutritional supplements don't

have long-lasting effects

and by the way on the point that Senator

Harkin made about how every supplement

has a label saying what's inside it well

funny story when a group of researchers

recently DNA tested supplements from a

dozen North American companies they

found that one-third contained no trace

whatsoever of the plant advertised on

the bottle if one in three milk bottles

didn't contain milk you might think

twice about pouring the white mystery

liquid all over your cereal but none of

this is likely to change because

companies have access to the one

genuinely truly effective wonder drug

it's called lobbying and here's how the

science works FDA regulation can really

stop up your profits jamming up your

whole money-making system which can lead

to painful effects on the company's

bottom line but with lobbying somehow

legal process all those pesky

regulations just melt away into

nothingness giving you that comfortable

corporate feeling of money

almost uncontrollably ask your lawyers

if lobbying is right for you

none of that stock none of this answers

the key dr. oz question now he says he

wasn't paid to mention any particular

products so why say those things on TV

at all in intent to engage viewers I use

flowery language I used language that

was very passionate that makes sense

because we're all looking for flowery

language from our physicians like the

sunlight shines upon the hidden grassy

meadow

so does chlamydia cast a warm glow upon

your private parts and when he says

engaging viewers that is the problem

perhaps his fatal flaw is that he's done

870 daily hour-long shows about health

and medicine which is impossible sooner

or later you're going to get tired of

doing shows about what your poop should

look like with Cameron Diaz this is ever

happen to you and luckily no I'm not a

girl that gets constipated good good for

you lucky you Diaz lucky you and instead

of that you're gonna get tempted to

overstretch and do a show with a title

like can an aspirin a day keep cancer

away to which the answer is clearly no

not not entirely because I feel like if

it did we wouldn't be hearing about it

for the first time at 4:00 p.m. on a

Wednesday afternoon hey did you hear

that I cured cancer no I was watching

Wendy Williams and look the frustrating

thing is it's easy to fill a show with

shameless pandering without dangerously

misleading medical information here I'll

show you I'll show you pandering that

you wouldn't believe hey everyone

wouldn't it be great if we had a Skype

interview with george RR martin the

writer of Game of Thrones

let's do it hey George George ha how's

the writing going I just killed

threatened your favorite character what

it's not aria it's not aria is it George

is not Aria please tell me it's not aria

just give me a clue damn you Martin okay

what what people seem to like that and

no one got hurt so let's keep pandering

um everyone likes puppies don't they

he's a puppy right now here's a puppy

hello puppy in know puppy look look

neither I nor a puppy are making

unsubstantiated claims about potentially

harmful dietary supplements you're not

doing that are you puppy look because

you don't need to do you precious you

don't need to unlock look here's a

here's something else that people like

women in trashy dresses throwing wine in

each other's faces

um go ladies calm down it's all

fabricated

let's keep pandering um who wants a

t-shirt

who wants a

people love t-shirts they know t-shirts

almost as much as they love celebrities

dancing and guess what his Steve Buscemi

tap dancing

we even know

any thoughts the only questionable

benefits of dietary supplements Oh John

this isn't really the time or place for

that discussion

exactly that's the point see dr. Moss

we've done it we engage viewers without

recommending any unregulated products we

can reduce diabetes please welcome the

black and gold Marty elite

you

journalists the heroes that we root for

in movies like all the President's Men

the great Muppet Caper and most recently

spotlight we gotta nail these scumbags

we gotta show people that nobody could

get away with this

not a priest or a cardinal a freakin

Pope

I remember spotlight actually won Best

Picture at the Oscars this year meaning

newspapers finally received the

recognition that we normally reserved

the subject of such importance as the

incredible bravery of real-life

Hollywood filmmakers the incredible

bravery of fictional Hollywood

filmmakers and the incredible bravery of

wanting to your daughter's friends

but but one of one of the things that

made spotlights so powerful is the

knowledge that the newspaper industry

today is in big trouble

papers have been closing and downsizing

for years and that affects all of us

even if you only get your news from

Facebook Google Twitter or Arianna

Huffington's blockwork Junction and book

excerpt Clearinghouse those places are

often just repackaging the work of

newspapers and it is not just websites

watch how often TV news ends up citing

print sources according to the Chicago

Tribune according to the Detroit Free

Press according to the San Francisco

Chronicle according to The Times

Picayune the Boston Globe the Orlando

Sentinel the Philadelphia Inquirer the

Pittsburgh tribune-review the Detroit

News and the Houston Chronicle reports

the Los Angeles Times reports The

Oklahoman reports The Hartford Courant

reports the Salt Lake Tribune reports

it's pretty obvious without newspapers

around to cite TV news would just be

Wolf Blitzer endlessly batting a ball of

yarn around and it is not just news

outlets stupid shows like ours lean

heavily on local papers in fact whenever

this show is mistakenly called

journalism it is a slap in the face to

the actual journalists whose work we

rely on I'll give you just one example

two years ago we ran a piece on state

lotteries and a not insignificant

portion of it was built on the work of

Harry Astaire a reporter at The

Oregonian here is a clip we used of him

talking about this series on camera Here

I am quoting one of his Oregonian

stories directly and Here I am doing it

again you probably didn't notice it at

the time because you were too fixated on

my balls choice of shiny gray tie we

check a dress shirt the ty says mafia

funeral the shirt says high school

debate tournament and the face says I am

not confident enough to carry this lock

off but but the point is we used a lot

of hairy steps work in that piece and

and we try to add new information to our

stories our researchers work incredibly

hard but the media is a food chain which

would fall apart without local

newspapers and the problem is print ads

are less popular than with advertisers

than they used to be and online ads

produce much less revenue I'll show you

between 2004 and 2014

newspapers gained two billion dollars in

online ad revenue unfortunately in that

same period they lost thirty billion

dollars in print revenue so that's like

finding a Lucky Penny on the sidewalk on

the same day your bank account is

drained by a 16 year old Belgian hacker

and this has led to cutbacks in

newsrooms again look at the Oregonian it

used to be a big moneymaker in fact in

1993 their editor talked about how proud

he was of its record of success I've

been at that paper more than 40 years

and every year I've been there I've seen

our staff increase I've seen our

salaries increase not a years gone by

that an employee at the Reunion

full-time employee has not been a

beneficiary of a raise now that level of

confidence is almost tempting fate

he's like a citizen of Pompeii saying

what I love about this city is how

volcano-proof it is not a year goes by

without us not having to have our

horrified reactions captured in Ash

forever

unfortunately the Oregonian circulation

has since dropped and in 2013 just as

hairiest EV was working on his lottery

series their parent company advanced

publications dropped a bombshell this

picture tweeted out from inside the

Oregonian shows staffers listening as

editor Peter Bhatia broke the news some

had feared the paper will split in two

stop seven-day-a-week Home Delivery and

lay off some employees this is an a

strategic move to really focus everybody

on what that digital

future is and what our digital products

and services can be it's true they

became a digital first company and

digital first sounds like a high school

euphemism for seductively sucking on a

finger I put my finger in his mouth we

totally got to digital first it was like

ooh but it was also like hot and that

that meant big changes a local weekly

the willamette week got their hands on a

PowerPoint presentation for the

Oregonian staff outlining the fact

reporters would be expected to meet a

quota of three blog posts a day and on

any post of substance they would have to

post the first comment and what better

way to win the trust of your readers

than posting first underneath your own

article those rules were widely

criticized and have since been relaxed

but extra digital demands being placed

on journalists is now common throughout

the industry just listen to Washington

Post editor Marty Baron who you might

remember as the guy Liev Schreiber

played in spotlight he describes his

concerns about the average workload

required of journalists they have to do

their traditional reporting they have

participate in social media they have to

produce a wire service that's available

24 hours a day they have to be

responsible for video you name it

they're involved they're involved in it

it's a lot to ask that's true and if

journalists are constantly required to

write edit shoot videos and tweet

mistakes are going to get made perhaps

that is how the Boston Globe wound up

tweeting following a shooting in

Tennessee that the FBI had invested

farted about 70 leaks clearly if they

had more time they would have written

hashtag investor farted because that's

how you drive the conversation hashtag

investor party

now now add the Oregonian and the

Oregonian those digital demands came

just as almost a quarter of the newsroom

was laid off and over time even more

staffers left the paper including State

House reporters a two-time Pulitzer

winner and Harry is Steph so his work

bolstered our lottery piece and now the

lack of his work has bolstered this

journalism piece so you can't say that

we don't use every part of the hairiest

EV but here is where it gets frightening

because while the Oregonian rebuilt its

Statehouse team other papers have been

forced to simply go without a study of

over 200 papers found between 2003 and

2014 their number of full-time State

House reporters declined by 35 percent

and that's not good because while there

are some great web outlets

some of which do cover local government

there aren't nearly enough to replace

what has been lost just listen to David

Simon who before creating the TV show

the wire worked for years at the

Baltimore Sun the day I run into a

Huffington Post reporter at a Baltimore

Zoning Board hearing is the day that I

will be confident that we've actually

reached some sort of equilibrium you

know there there's no glory in that kind

of journalism but that is the bedrock of

what keeps you know got the next 10 or

15 years in this country are going to be

a halcyon error for state and local

political corruption is gonna be one of

the great times to be a corrupt

politician well you know I I really envy

them I really do he's right because not

having reporters at government meetings

is like a teacher leaving her room of

seventh graders to supervise themselves

best-case scenario Brittany gets gum in

her hair worst case scenario you no

longer have a school

I look it is clearly smart for

newspapers to expand online but the

danger in doing that is the temptation

to gravitate toward whatever gets the

most clicks

which is why news organizations badly

need to have leaders who appreciate that

what's popular isn't always what's most

important but that is not always the

case look at Sam Zell a billionaire

investor and living garden gnome nine

nine years ago he took over the Tribune

Company which owns newspapers like the

LA Times the Orlando Sentinel and the

Chicago Tribune after acquiring the

company he spoke to the Sentinels

nervous staff outlining his vision and

listened to one particular exchange with

a journalist his his last two words are

perhaps the most illuminating 11 very

simple I want to make enough money so I

can afford you it's really that simple

okay you need to in effect help me by

being a journalist that focuses and what

our readers want and therefore generates

more revenue but what readers want a

puppy dogs II mean we also need to

inform the community sorry I'm sorry ah

I can't hug him you're you're giving me

the classic what I would call

journalistic arrogance of deciding that

puppies don't come hopefully they get to

the point where our revenue is so

significant that we can do puppies

interact okay

whoa Sam Zell just created an inspiring

new motto for the Sentinels masthead all

the puppy news that's fit to print and

maybe some Iraq news too if we can

afford it

q now now the good news is Zell no

longer owns the tribune company the bad

news is their latest attempt to balance

business pressures with journalistic

responsibility has not been

confidence-inspiring just this year its

publishing arm tribute publishing was

rebranded into something much much

stupider this is the future of

journalists this is the future of

content it doesn't get much better than

that if you care about media and

technology this is the place to be

Truong stands for attribute online

content yes trunk they have chosen to

call themselves trunk which sounds like

the noise and ejaculating elephant mates

or or more appropriately the sound of a

stack of print newspapers being thrown

into a dumpster and if you are wondering

how trunks business model will be

different get ready to have your minds

trunked one of the key ways we're going

to harness the power of our journalism

is to have a optimization group this

trunk team will work with all the local

markets to harness the power of our

local journalism feed it into a funnel

and then optimize it so that we reach

the biggest global audience possible

what did she just say they're going to

feed journalism into a funnel oh we're

just going to take content and simply

cram it down your throat like you're an

abused goose and the corresponding

visuals make even less sense what is

happening here it looks like a bunch of

digital sperm impregnating a trunk egg

filming but what seems at first like a

banal corporate rebranding speech

quickly goes off the rails with their

next big idea artificial intelligence is

going to allow journalists to do their

jobs more efficiently

finding the right photos the videos the

databases the things that you were

packaged your stories with right now

that's a manual effort with artificial

intelligence you can create a system

that automatically is doing that for you

ok ok ok putting aside the news robots I

would like to take a moment to break

down what may be the most meaningless

graphic ever created we take a look on

the left there is the phrase

reading habits but once those reading

habits undergo X they become increased

consumption

it almost feels like a test and the

first employee to raise their hand and

say that doesn't mean anything becomes

king of the news and look it is easy to

make fun of tronc I could happily do it

for another 20 minutes but the truth is

publishers are desperate no one seems to

have a perfect plan to keep newspapers

afloat

one option seems to be to pray you get

bought by a billionaire benefactor who

could afford to swallow losses Amazon

founder Jeff Bezos bought The Washington

Post in 2013 and since then they've done

some spectacular journalism and the

reporters seem pretty happy despite some

of his stupider ideas like and this is

true a game that would allow a reader

who didn't enjoy an article to pay to

remove its vowels which is just absurd

taking out all the vowels makes every

word sound like the name of an app I'll

give you an example Turkey is a nation

in crisis Turk is a dating service that

helps you long-haul truckers but but

there are potential downsides to having

a rich owner especially if there is a

concern that they could meddle with the

papers coverage just look at what

happened to the Las Vegas review-journal

last year it was acquired by Sheldon

Adelson at the billionaire casino

magnate and Republican mega donor he's a

big deal in Vegas and his businesses are

at the center of a lot of stories the

reviewed journal covers but while

Adelson and the papers editors have

strongly denied that he interferes with

news coverage in any way the editors

have admitted that they put any articles

about him or his business through a

special review process to make sure that

they are fair although listen to an ex

deputy deputy editor describe his

experience of that process in this

review process things are changed things

are added things are removed there's no

explanation for why and there's no

appeal more than once reporters have

asked if they could have their name

taken off the story and have been told

no that's not allowed anymore there are

things that are done because it's known

that this is the way Sheldon Adelson

wants it to read and it can be something

very minor or it can be something very

very big

now if that's true that is very

compromising there could not be a worse

owner of a paper in Vegas than Sheldon

Adelson with the possible exception of

cirque de soleil because they wouldn't

even give you a newspaper you just have

a fistful of glitter

thrown in your face by a 90-pound man in

a thong and and look look none of this

is to say that there aren't people

producing great work in local news rooms

right now many are at the Oregonian at

the review-journal

even at trunk but they are doing

it despite their current conditions and

the truth is a big part of the blame for

this industry's dire straits is on us

and our unwillingness to pay for the

work journalists produce we've just

grown accustomed to getting unused for

free and the longer that we get

something for free the less willing we

are to pay for it and I'm talking to you

the person watching this segment on

YouTube using the Wi-Fi from the coffee

shop underneath your apartments killing

us

so later we are either going to have to

pay for journalism or we are all going

to pay for it because if we don't

not only will malfeasance run amok but

the journalism movies of the future are

going to look a lot more like this in a

city built on secrets I'm hearing

there's corruption in City Hall

only a newsroom willing to stop at

nothing can uncover the truth and might

go all the way to the top all the way to

the top a new and I think we could prove

that they knew

yeah I'm just not sure what can I clicks

we're gonna get on that you know anybody

else I've got a thing about a cat that

looks like a raccoon or it could be a

raccoon it looks like a cat wait I'm not

sure now we're talking yeah yeah yeah

yeah that's great let's figure that out

all right yeah maybe an online poll it's

political corruption in Boston we'll

come back to that if we have time but I

like the rat cat rat cat that's great

what blow the roof off that eats the

movie critics are hailing as genuinely

deflating and depressingly accurate The

Oregonian raves but who needs a Drake

for reporters uh actually I'm taking a

buyout three reporters technically I'm

not a reporter I'm the director of

social media strategies but I consider

myself an important part of the editor

to reporters I'm also leaving I'm being

replaced by Ripa though this is one

reporter and some kind of burnt orange X

choose the story of a lifetime what is

the thing dog until RocketBallz we're

talking all the way up to the mayor I

got kids man I want to sit - yo yo honey

is all hey nobody Holley and Arica

mcdonnen Hey sorry to interrupt

hi hi doing buddy I gotta talk to you

about your Twitter it's like a ghost

town in here what's going on man we

talked about this eight tweets a day I'm

in the middle of t-bone how many tweets

eight that's right okay we're not

counting retweets he wasn't just up

against the most powerful voices in City

Hall I need answers and you're the only

one who could give him to me he was up

against the most powerful voices at his

newspapers fair in

we gotta show people that no one can get

away with this we got a nail League

scumbags let me stop you right there

hopefully we can get to the point where

we can do racoon cats and City Hall but

we're not there so few the

journal-constitution raids actually we

had to get rid of our full-time movie

reviewer nine years ago so we haven't

seen it yet and the Las Vegas

review-journal says for fun and

excitement look no further than Sheldon

Adelson's casinos and resorts don't care

about you people I still believe in

newspapers I hear you but technically

you don't work for a newspaper anymore

you work at a multi-platform content

generation distribution network now the

REC cat is it adorable or skim you know

what it's like it's cute could it be

scary though we could make it scary as

mics get some clicks cuz some retweets

get some forward I'm talking about

corruption in City Hall yeah we're gonna

get back the archdiocese gotta keep it

moving I gotta keep it moving we just

need a story we can fun okay bud

you know yeah there you go like a little

piggies tail funnel vision exactly think

of like a witch's head upside down went

for the car monocle actually we

rebranded yeah you work for short

is charm hey there you go that's a good

idea for a story stoplight he tried to

break the story he was told to pump the

brakes

oh hey Tommy hey got great news for you

I'm gonna take you off that whole City

Hall thing have you worked the raccoon

cat beat with Chloe air cat record

Melissa

reckon cow anyway I really want you to

dig on this thing okay you know dig like

a raccoon cat stop light

coming soon to a midsize American city

newspaper near you

immigration the system that brought you

me but it's still good and I promise

that won't happen again

immigration has been dominating the news

all week long as a caravan of migrants

from Central America continues to head

north and despite it being a thousand

miles and possibly months away Trump has

made it a centerpiece of his closing

arguments heading into the midterms at

this very moment large well organized

caravans of migrants are marching toward

our southern border some people call it

an invasion it's like an invasion a lot

of young men strong men and a lot of men

that maybe we don't want in our country

I don't want them in our country and

women don't want them in our country

women want security men don't want them

in our country but the women do not want

them women want security why young

strong men are invading our country and

coming from our women that is such old

timey racism I'm genuinely amazed that

imogen automatically turned black and

white as he thought like Pleasantville

in Reverse this week Trump has been

threatening immigration actions ranging

from sending 15,000 troops to the border

to ending birthright citizenship and

look it is hard to know what the

president will or even can do going

forward so tonight instead of focusing

on hypotheticals I thought it might be

useful to look backwards at something

he absolutely did do concerning

immigrants family separation it was part

of his zero-tolerance policy where

parents crossing the border were locked

up prosecuted and had their children

taken away the story dominated the news

back in June with distressing images of

kids in cages and shelters milania's

very cool jackets reading I really don't

care to you and of course this moment I

read today about a ten-year-old girl

with Down syndrome who was taken from

her mother and put in a cage I read

about a a they just they won't want to a

ten-year-old with Down syndrome yes he

did yes Coelho and Taos Key said

womp-womp but and if there is any

justice that will be carved on his

gravestone and when he arrives at the

pearly gates the first thing he'll he

all be oh hi Cori I've been waiting a

long time to say this to you 1 put warm

after a national outcry and court

challenges the President signed an order

reversing course and the story kind of

faded from the headlines but it is

really worth revisiting because a number

of government reports recently came out

giving us a much clearer picture of what

was actually happening and while it

seemed malicious and chaotic at the time

at every step it was even worse than you

might assume so let's look at two major

aspects of family separation how it was

done and why and it starts with the how

because you may remember heartbreaking

stories of parents unsure where their

children had been taken but when Alex SR

Secretary of Health and Human Services

was asked about this he reassured

everyone that there was nothing to worry

about there is no reason why any parent

would not know where their child is

located I could at the stroke of ethic

at keystrokes I've sat on the ORR portal

with sit with just basic keystrokes

within seconds could find any child in

our care for any parent you know it's

not every day that you see a man testify

with the goal of convincing people he

has access to a lot of kids on his

computer seriously guys just a few taps

on the old keyboard and it's kid City on

this thing pretty much the second I open

my computer boob I'm up to my neck in

children and yes I heard how that sounds

and you know what I like it well I saw

may have known where the kids in his

custody were that was only one piece of

the puzzle the critical information that

allowed kids to be matched with parents

was compiled by a different Department

Homeland Security and an Inspector

General report found that their data was

not just incomplete and inconsistent but

that each step of this process was

vulnerable to human error increasing the

risk that a child could be lost in the

system which is terrible you should be

able to lose children in a government

system as easily as in a chuck-e-cheese

ball pit I'm sorry we're gonna have to

call off the search mrs. Donaldson

Ralphie's loss to the balls now

in fact what we've been told that the

government separated around 2600

children and around 220 kids are still

being held away from their parents we

actually can't say for sure whether

either of those numbers are accurate

just two weeks ago the government

apparently found 14 more children and

added them to Italian just think about

that 14 children were missing and we

didn't even know it how was that not a

bigger story when those 12 boys were

stuck in a cave in Thailand there were

live cameras and Elon Musk was sending

submersibles and calling rescuers

pedophiles now I'm not saying that's

what I wanted to happen here I didn't

want it to happen then but at least

people are paying attention and

all this incompetence should have been

obvious because when nonprofits tried to

check on the kids the government often

didn't have a good system to locate

those that were listed as being present

we were given a list by the government

and we were told that we could choose

who we wanted to speak to looking

through the list of over 500 names I

noticed that there were some very young

children there including a two year old

several one year olds and one child that

was listed as being zero so I asked to

see those children they left and came

back and said that they couldn't find

the children they said to me what we

called out their name and nobody

responded so we don't know where they

are so I sort of said there's babies

their babies obviously they're not gonna

respond to their name being called okay

anyone who calls a babies name and then

gives up on finding them either knows

nothing about babies or is covering for

a baby who doesn't actually want to be

reached sorry

so it just tell them I'm not in today

I'm Optima diaper in triangles over here

I've got a 2:30 meeting with my young

toes to prep for Mondays I'm all right

seriously am i right I don't know the

days of the week I am after all a

baby and even with even with the

help of nonprofits in locating and

reuniting parents hundreds of whom

incidentally were actually deported

without their children the government

still had like when one mother

who'd had her five month old

breastfeeding baby taken away was later

handed back the wrong baby and just to

imagine thinking you're about to be

reunited with your child after being

forced apart

and being given someone else's shitty

baby I'd say this as a parents my infant

is a miracle and a joy anyone else's is

a charmless snots monster get it away

from me

so to put it mildly

when it comes to how did we do this the

answer seems to be a combination of

incompetently and cruelly which brings

us to the other big question why why did

we do this well so many Trump

administration argue that they simply

had no choice are you intending for this

to play out as it is playing out are you

intending for parents to be separated

from their children are you intending to

send a message I find that offensive no

because what why would I ever create a

policy that purposely does that no no a

deterrent I would never you offend me

sir here's the thing about this

administration you can always tell you

figured out exactly what they're doing

when they get offended by your

description of what they might be doing

it's a pretty obvious tone he's like a

poker player ejaculating every time they

have a good hand okay I think we all see

what's happening here now often the

official line was that family

separations were not a deterrent they

were simply a consequence of having to

enforce the law as the then acting head

of ice

Thomas Holman explained at the time

every law enforcement agency in this

country separates parents from children

when they're arrested for a crime we are

a law enforcement agency we are

enforcing the criminal laws I don't

blame anybody want to be the greatest

country in there at being a part of this

greatest country on earth which we all

are but there are a white way to do it

there's a wrong way to do it okay it's

pretty hard to listen to someone say

with the greatest country on Earth while

simultaneously justifying why we're

unnecessarily ripping kids away from

their parents especially when that

person looks like what would happen if a

kind of monster energy drink John

Lithgow but a few things there regarding

the right way because first many of

these people were applying for asylum

meaning they're seeking protection from

persecution and under international and

US law it is legal to apply for that no

matter how you enter the country second

while the Trump administration insisted

that the right way for solemn seekers to

come in was through a port of entry like

an official border crossing they made it

far

more difficult to do that with many be

repeatedly denied entry into the country

and forced to wait days or even weeks

and you can't just arbitrarily delay

people that long

there are solemn seekers looking for

safety not AT&T customers trying to

speak to a representative that's right

no finally finally crossing the border

in the wrong way is actually only a

misdemeanor on first offense in fact

most people are usually just sentenced

to time served and that's the thingy

contrary to what you might think most of

the parents who were separated from

their kids were charged to plead guilty

and serve their sentence all fairly

quickly now in the past we generally

didn't prosecute parents and even let

many of them go free awaiting their

immigration hearing which makes sense so

why did we suddenly start keeping people

who had already served their time locked

up and away from their kids

well because Trump hated the old system

he called it catch and release and he

described it in wildly misleading terms

we catch a criminal a real criminal a

rough tough criminal we take his name

and then we release him and we say

please show up to court in a couple of

months you know what the chances of

getting up the quarter like zero okay

now deep down when Trump said the number

zero you just instinctively knew that no

matter what the number was it was

definitely not zero right because if he

says something's hot it's cold if he

said something's up it's down if he said

this is a cute puppy you'd automatically

think I'm not sure why or how but that

puppy is definitely a asshole

and when it comes to family seeking

asylum who remember were the ones

largely impacted by family separation

the number is ridiculously far from zero

because 96% of them turned up to court

after being released from detention and

under Obama administration program

called family case management where each

family was assigned a case manager who

then helped them navigate the system

99.3% attended their hearing so Trump

was wrong he was 99.3% wrong and you

know what that means

you probably expecting the tiger to come

out now but sadly he died of sadness

several months ago so all this but now

does is increase my morphine drip so it

just numbs the pain it's not perfect but

it helps see you later now Trump

discontinued that case management

program despite the fact that even ice

called it an overall success and went

with ripping families apart instead so

for the final time

why if they'd already paid the price for

their crime and there were other better

ways to ensure that they showed up for

court why the everlasting did we

really do this well I would argue that

this is the logical result of a general

hard right turn toward demonizing

immigrants for political advantage in a

way that some might call racist and

others would be wrong about now

conservative immigration arguments

essentially now follow a pretty clear

pattern crossing the border is a crime

therefore anyone crossing it is a

criminal and since all criminals are

dangerous anyone crossing the border is

a dangerous criminal never mind the fact

that immigrants are less likely to

commit crimes than people born here that

has simply not stopped Republicans from

running toxic anti-immigrant anti

caravan political ads like these a young

woman gunned down by an illegal

immigrant who should have been deported

illegal aliens invade America Democrats

who stand in our way will be complicit

in every murder committed

by illegal immigrants Mexican drug lords

ms-13 gang members sex traffickers ms-13

violent gang members gang members known

criminals people from the Middle East oh



you know that's racist because they just

gave up any pretense of specific

fear-mongering and simply said people

from the Middle East at that point why

not go all in and just start naming

groups you hate the caravan also

contains Planned Parenthood gays who

want wedding cakes black Santa and a

thirty-foot Nancy Pelosi Democrats will

be complicit in every person the giant

Pelosi is and if you watch enough of

those ads you realize it's not that they

don't want immigrants to come here

because they're criminals is that

they're calling them criminals because

they don't want them to come here and to

see that in action

just watch this exchange that CNN had

with a New Jersey Trump supporter so

you're worried about immigration only

coming in the illegal way not the legal

way come in the legal way and you are

more than welcome I mean it is legal to

seek asylum well I hope Trump changes

that you don't want any asylum seekers

no no it's simply not often that you see

someone's cover story fall apart with so

little are you three kids wearing

a trench coat no do you want some ice

cream yes there are three of us and we

all like chocolates we're we're now so

accustomed to see immigrants as a threat

the politicians routinely talk about

them in the language of war remember

Trump referred to the caravan as an

invasion and sent troops to the border

and that kind of militaristic talk can

make people think that it is necessary

to make the kind of impossible choices

made during a war which is how things

like family separation happen just

watches Jessica Vaughn of an

anti-immigration think-tank tries to

justify what we did a lot of Americans

find it appalling what do you say to

them I think it's appalling that we have

to do it what do you think the

consequences are for these children that

have gone

that are still going through this trauma

I think it's very possible that some of

these kids war will have some lasting

effects right

but lasting damage to children is a huge

consequence you're separating them from

their parents not telling them you ate

all their Halloween candy to get on

Jimmy Kimmel while we're on that

topic know what to do that I mean I'm

really glad that some people do because

it's extremely funny but nobody should

but please keep doing it and while she

acknowledges that what we're doing is

appalling she says we have to do it but

the truth is we don't we don't have to

do any of it because even though the

language of war is being used there is

not a war and the only reason people

keep talking like there is one is to

give themselves permission to make the

choices they want to be forced to make

but family separation cannot be one of

them because as she says these kids will

have some lasting effects but what

that's easy to say in the context of

abstract pediatric science the reality

of it is heartbreaking take

Henry he's a six-year-old from Honduras

he was separated from his mother and

reunited after a month apart but as a

documentary crew found their ordeal was

far from over and I'm warning you this

is going to be rough to watch

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

the Colosseum formerly artemiy who had

come down mucho somewhere get hurt we

who ya knows wait to eHome yeah we did

that and not because we had to but

because we chose to and horrific ly we

may actually be about to do it again

Trump has publicly 30 with bringing back

family separation and Thomas home and

supported that idea during a recent

interview with Fox & Friends

or as it's not in the business a

face-to-face meeting with the president

well let me talk about the

zero-tolerance policy that was the right

thing to do regardless how sad and

unfortunate no one was he family

separated but when they separated those

people that were prosecuted into the

country illegally the numbers went down

22% in just two weeks if they would have

stuck with that for 30 60 days there

wouldn't be a caravan today yeah maybe

Tom and you know what if we surrounded

the border with randomly firing

flamethrowers and snakes that we tried

to stand up whenever anyone approached

that could potentially drive the caravan

away to but we don't do things like that

cuz it's not supposed to be who we

are

and painfully aware for this Trump

here's that idea coming out of a

television he may well go someone write

that down

snakes and flamethrowers that's a great

idea I had it that's my idea so look

look if the president really wants to

make Tuesdays in election about him and

about immigration

then then fine let's make it about that

because family separation is perhaps the

most emblematic moment of his presidency

so far it was cruel

sloppy needless racist and ultimately

exactly what we should have expected and

I would argue the biggest threat to our

status as the greatest nation on earth

is not a caravan a thousand miles south

of us it's whoever thinks that doing

this is an acceptable response

you

I would like to talk to you about the

sausage principle the theory that says

if you love something never find out how

it was made well tonight I would like to

show you my sausage wait wait this is my

sausage the 2014 FIFA World Cup okay the

World Cup starts this week and I am both

excited and extremely conflicted about

it now I know in America soccer is

something you pick your ten-year-old

daughter up from but but for me and

everyone else on earth it's a little

more important soccer had become

d'azyr's religion in Colombia soccer was

a religion football is a religion here

soccer or football like we say it's a

religion yeah and they're not

exaggerating when David Beckham got a

tattoo of Jesus the response of most

soccer fans was that that's huge for

Jesus that's that's a big deal for him

hey here's here's my conflict the World

Cup is one of my favorite things but

it's organized by these guys

FIFA you either know it as the

fédération Internationale de Football

Association or that soccer video game

you have but for American viewers who

may never have encountered them FIFA is

a comically grotesque organization in

fact telling someone about the inner

workings of FIFA for the first time it's

a bit like showing someone two girls one

cup yeah you do it mainly so you can

watch the horrified expression on

people's faces

because let's start where FIFA's current

World Cup is about to take place

Brazil Brazilians are excited about

everything this is how they celebrate

the fact that it's just about to be Lent

they love the concept of giving up

chocolate temporarily they're also the

biggest soccer fans on earth so they

must be thrilled at the prospect of

hosting the World Cup there's been

months of unrest in some of the cities

for villas or slums with clashes between

police and residents here people

demonstrated against Brazil holding the

World Cup that makes no sense why would

you be unhappy hosting the thing that

you love the most in all the world the

government has spent more than eleven

billion dollars getting ready the United

States team will play its second game

here in the city of Manaus in this

brand-new 270 million dollar stadium

Manaus is so remote that it's almost

impossible to reach by car which is why

officials had to have the stadium

materials brought in by boat shipped

across the Atlantic from Portugal and up

the Amazon River okay that does seem

like a waste of money especially when

you consider that that stadium is only

going to be used for for World Cup games

there's also no team in Manaus that can

fill it afterwards at which point it

becomes the world's most expensive bird

toilet

no wonder Brazilians are so upset

especially when you think about what

they are actually getting in return well

in their gonna make money as well as

we're worried this ng FIFA makes the

money this is where the controversy is

the country usually doesn't make money

FIFA the organization of the World Cup

is who makes the money yep Brazil let me

put this in terms you might understand

think of money as pubic hair and FIFA as

wax they're gonna be all over you during

the World Cup but when they go they're

taking all the money with them

including some from places you didn't

even know you had any money leaving you

teary eyes going Jesus what happened

here what happened I'm never doing this

again because here are FIFA's tax

demands for prospective host countries

it is FIFA and it's FIFA subsidiaries

that are fully exempt from any tax

whatsoever levied at whatever level

state level municipality level all sorts

of taxes consumption taxes income taxes

you name it it's all attempt that's

right by Brazil's own estimates they're

allowing FIFA to forego 250 million

dollars in taxes somewhere Wesley Snipes

is going so soccer was the answer God it

seems so obvious now now now FIFA says

they leave a lot behind which they do

like new laws because you see once upon

a time Brazil did this in 2003 the

Brazilian government banned alcohol from

stadiums because of the enormous ly high

death rate amongst fans that seems like

a good idea

potentially lifesaving even the only

problem is Budweiser is one of FIFA's

key sponsors and they sell a product

they reflexively insist on calling beer

and FIFA seemed anxious to protect

Budweiser from a law designed to protect

people

which is why FIFA Secretary General went

to Brazil with a simple message I'm

sorry to say and maybe I look a bit

arrogant but that something will not

negotiator I mean there will be and

there must be as part of the of the law

the fact that we have the right to sell

beer is a maybe I look a bit arrogant

but how you say your laws and your

public safety is this adds a drag

and the amazing thing is here FIFA won

they successfully pressured Brazil into

passing a so-called Budweiser bill

allowing beer sales in soccer stadiums

and at this point you can either be

horrified by that or relieved that FIFA

wasn't also sponsored by cocaine and

chainsaws and Brazil Brazil is lucky cuz

you're lucky

at least they just had FIFA force

alcohol on them when South Africa hosted

the World Cup four years ago FIFA forced

the creation of the FIFA World Cup

courts which sound funny annoyed it's

like going to the World Series and being

dragged in front of Judge Phillie

Phanatic except FIFA's courts were no

joke to Zimbabweans who robbed foreign

journalists on a Wednesday were arrested

on a Thursday and began 15 years L

sentences the next day that is

unsettlingly fast that's like when you

order Chinese food and it comes five

minutes later thanks very much but that

was too quick you didn't have time to

make this properly and there is a

certain irony in FIFA setting up any

kind of justice system given the

scandals that have dogged it over the

years football's governing body is

trying to tackle its shady inner

workings by suspending two executives on

corruption charges the FIFA scandal

rumbles on Jack Warner who was at the

center of bribery accusations has

resigned as vice president there's been

so many corruption scandals that FIFA

have had to deal with bribery and FIFA

go together like peanut butter and jelly

yeah but they shouldn't though peanut

butter and jelly are supposed to go

together FIFA and bribery should go

together like peanut butter and a child

with a deadly nut allergy no no it's for

your brother

I like it do you think FIFA can't get

any more cartoonishly evil this is their

headquarters actual boardroom that's

right

FIFA apparently modeled where they meet

on the war room from dr. Strangelove

that is Exhibit A for an organization

that does not give a what you think

about them and yet the head of FIFA

maintains that they are merely a humble

nonprofit organization we are a

nonprofit organization and we have to

remain a non-profit organism nonprofit

with over a billion dollars in the bank

yeah but this is a reserve a reserve a

reserve of a billion dollars when your

rainy day fund is so big you've got to

check it for swimming cartoon ducks you

might not be a not profit anymore but

that by the way

is Sepp Blatter and even his name should

have been a red flag if your name is set

at the bare minimum

you've strangled someone in a bar fight

that's just a fact I let me just give

you a taste of Sepp Blatter as a human

being recently he was asked how should

women's soccer be made more popular he

said well they should wear shorter

shorts great idea

put the ladies in hot pants call it foxy

soccer and while you're at it tighten up

the jerseys maybe replace the ball with

a plate of hot wings and KITT let's just

open her hooters FIFA FIFA the humble

non profits even recently spent 27

billion dollars to fund United passions

a fictionalized version of their history

starring for some reason Tim Roth as

Sepp Blatter and this movie like FIFA

itself looks terrible

will be the fédération Internationale de

Football Association FIFA the first war

Cup will be held in Uruguay you have

everything you need to run a family but

you know the slightest error and you're

up

who makes a sports film where their

heroes are the executives and the crazy

thing is you don't need two hours and

Tim Roth because the greatest film about

Sepp Blatter has already been made it's

ten seconds long and it's on YouTube

wonderfully that is the one time you can

genuinely say I'm glad that old man fell

off that stage but perhaps the worst

part of FIFA is not even its past or its

present its its future because the host

of the 2022 World Cup has already been

decided do we know to organize the 2:22

FIFA World Cup is Qatar Qatar there's

between 1 and 50 reasons why that is an

awful idea summer temperatures in Qatar

can reach some 50 degrees Celsius a

difficult environment to hold a

professional sporting than outdoors 50

degrees Celsius is 122 degrees

Fahrenheit you are hosting the World Cup

somewhere where soccer cannot physically

be played that's like if the NFL chose

to host the Super Bowl in a lake now

that there are no allegations that some

fee for executives took bribes to put

the World Cup in Qatar and I hope that's

true because otherwise it makes

literally no sense and not just because

of the weather but because of the

working conditions guitar is a slave

state in the 21st century a migrant

worker can't leave the country without

an exit visa that visa has to be

approved by his employer who has your

passport and a bottle they know each

other so you're trapped here we've got

coffins coming home every day more than

a worker per day on average is dying

conservatively from the figures of just

two countries India and Nepal more than

4,000 workers will die before a ball is

kicked off in 2022 so what you're

essentially saying is the Qatar World

Cup is shaping up to be the most deadly

Middle East construction project since

this one and and by this point I hope

I've proven to you that FIFA is just

appalling and yet here's their power I

am still so excited about the world

next week and it's very hard to justify

how I can get so much joy from an

organization that's caused so much pain

other than going back to right where we

started soccer or football like we say

it's a religion but it's not just that

it's an organized religion and FIFA is

its Church just think about it its

leader is infallible it compels South

American countries to spend money they

don't have building opulent cathedrals

and it may ultimately be responsible for

the deaths of shocking numbers of people

in the Middle East

but-but-but-but the millions of people

around the world like me it is also the

guardian of the only thing that gives

their lives any meaning and if that

comparison does not make Americans love

soccer then frankly nothing will

this is actually our last show of the

season for our main story we thought

we'd pull back a little bit and look at

one of the biggest questions that has

defined this year how good was a star is

born star was born over the weekend a

great movie and it was amazing it was

amazing it's still on my heart

Bradley Cooper had ahold of my soul

there for a little while it's uh it it

is beyond great maybe it's time let the

old ways

Bradley Cooper oh my gosh go see the

movie go see it yeah that guy loves him

and he's distinctive for the Dallas

Cowboys

no one doesn't like a star is born it's

the one movie that even Neil deGrasse

Tyson can't ruin John I had a small

issue with the film see if you want to

know how a star is actually born you

start with a gas cloud shut up shut up

you shut up Neil deGrasse Tyson let this

be the one thing about Stassi don't

ruined

unfortunately we're not talking about a

star is born tonight in fact we're going

to talk about the exact opposite of that

movie the troubling rise of

authoritarian leaders around the world a

lot of them there are the ones that you

instinctively think about like your

bladder Mir Putin and Xi Jingping who've

been steadily consolidating their power

there's the re-election of strong men

like Hungary's Viktor Orban and turkeys

worship Diwan and then there's what

happened just last month in the world's

fifth largest country Brazil has a new

president becoming a latest nation to

elect a far-right leader extreme right

populist bolson era has exalted the

country's military dictatorship

advocated torture and threatened to

destroy jail or drive his political

opponents into exile is calling for

unity oh that's nice he's calling for

unity is he yet the problem is he

expressed an affection for torture and

dictatorship before that and political

platforms are a bit like tinder profiles

once you advocate torture it doesn't

really matter what else you say it's all

the people are gonna remember and for

good reason and not what what well no to

authoritarian leaders are the same the

global trend toward them is alarming

especially because in many cases people

are actively choosing them a report

recently concluded that one-third of the

world's population lives in a

backsliding democracy and that is why

there's a pretty good chance that you

may have been watching the news at some

point this year and found yourself

saying what the is happening to the

world and why so tonight let's look at

three common traits that authoritarian

leaders tend to have to try and figure

out what can make them so appealing to

people and to what extent this country

is in danger of heading in the same

direction and the first trait is

projecting strength authoritarians tend

to love grand displays of force like the

military parades featuring weaponry that

you've seen places like China North

Korea Venezuela and Russia where they'll

even sometimes throw in a surprise

musical number

[Music]

yeah what a warning there Russia

that's what musicals are like when you

don't allow gay people tell you that

spectacles like those serve a purpose as

many authoritarians project strength out

of a real concern that they may be seen

as illegitimate in kind of the same way

that a man who is insecure about his

penis buys a motorcycle or takes up

bodybuilding or invents the Tesla how

how weird is your penis even how weird

is it but projecting military strength

often isn't enough men you

authoritarians tend to conflate their

country's national identity with their

personal identity so they individually

need to appear strong to that most

obvious example of this is Vladimir

Putin who's taken so many glamor shots

there are calendars of him that the

latest ones feature him

cuddling leopards taking a shirtless ice

bath and sunbathing which cool but but

but he's not alone there's also Chechen

leader Ramzan Kadyrov's ridiculous

workout videos which I frankly cannot

recommend highly enough it's like

watching a Keebler Elf get ripped

although my favorite example of this is

also actually the saddest just watch as

the authoritarian president of

Turkmenistan forces his cabinet to watch

him take a gold bar and do whatever this

is

Wow when you go to work tomorrow and

you're forced to laugh at your

supervisors dumb jokes just spare a

thought for the people who had to give a

standing ovation to their boss for

lifting a golden curtain right so so

authoritarians are obsessed with

projecting strength and I often tell

their citizens that that strength is

necessary to protect them from what well

that actually brings us to their second

major trait a tendency to demonize

enemies authoritarians often go out of

their way to identify and sometimes

manufacture a group of evildoers from

whom they and they alone can save the

country in the Philippines Rodrigo

Duterte rose to power by claiming he was

the antidote to drug crime since 2016

Human Rights Watch estimates that his

drug war has killed more than 12,000

people many of them extrajudicially and

that shouldn't really be entirely

surprising given that this was an actual

message that his campaign issued at

Christmas alone in your acquittal lemon

verbena buddy Cooper in Merry Christmas

crema de Rugy star Bogdanov oh crap

criminal at the UNEP a pair of so

pilipino Hawaiian young metal at pitoni

para el corazon eaten a hole in you

Merry Christmas oh boy that is a hard

turn in a Christmas message although it

actually does remind me with

Thanksgiving coming up this week you

know I just like to take a moment to

wish a Happy Thanksgiving to everyone

watching this tonight especially if

you're a turkey because we're going to

slit your throat stuck your dumb bird

corpse with Brad's chopped vegetables

garlic and rosemary and then bake you in

an oven for four hours it's what you

deserve this will be your final

Happy Thanksgiving

sorry where was I oh that's right

authoritarian Sneed enemies because one

of their greatest appeals is making a

complicated world simple if you're under

attack or you've been made to feel that

way it is nice to have a charismatic

individual say the rules the

system I've got this

that's an impulse that we're all

vulnerable to take me I believe in the

separation of powers and the rule of law

but if America were to descend into a

Civil War and someone said hey what if

we just let Tom Hanks figure it out a

not insignificant part of me would go

yeah that seems nice in fact all praise

Daddy Hanks long live the Gump of death

to his enemies when people are

frightened they can be more susceptible

to authoritarians that is why if a real

threat doesn't present itself strong men

will sometimes make one up often

targeting a group that's persecuted to

begin with like immigrants or minorities

Viktor orbán's right would turn in

hungary has been accompanied by stoking

fear of Muslims and refugees and when

Putin was facing a dip in popularity a

few years ago he went after gay people

suggesting that homosexuality was a

weapon of the EU to weaken Russia which

yes sounds ridiculous but judging by

this man the message may have gone

across Russia is not Europe we have our

own conservative traditional values at

the moment in Europe these boundaries

are being crossed because they're

legalizing pedophilia they're legalizing

zoophilia they have zoo brothels wait

are you sure about that

he's I'm pretty confident that there is

no such thing as a zoo brothel a zoo

brothel is if anything just a regular

zoo where you can split the zookeeper 20

bucks to leave you alone in the penguin

area and you would hope don't think

about that if you don't like it just

don't absorb it just don't absorb the

idea in your mind and you would hope

that an independent press or an

opposition party might push back on that

sort of which actually brings

us to our final key trait which is

dismantling institutions because as they

gain power or ferret Aryans will try to

weaken any check on them journalists in

authoritarian regimes are frequently

threatened in

and killed or in putin's russia have

tragic accidents that hopefully others

may learn from an authoritarian will

also attack even more foundational

checks and balances like courts and

legislatures in recent years the

structures of government in Turkey China

Hungary and Venezuela have all been

modified to consolidate power under

their leaders and as Poland becomes

increasingly authoritarian their de

facto leader no longer has to worry

about the country's highest judge or

indeed many other judges because he his

party cleverly managed to force them out

simply by lowering their retirement age

and when some judges showed up to work

anyway in protest a government official

had this patronizing response they can

enter the building they can be their

vacant they can be there as guests but

they cannot work as judges because they

are retired I really don't blame those

judges for being furious about that

because as we all now know there are

only two ways to really piss off a judge

one force them into retirement or to ask

how many brews they'd usually pound when

working out with Vijay and squeeze they

don't like that at all so so look

projecting strange demonizing enemies

and dismantling institutions are very

broadly some key things that

authoritarians do and if you're

wondering who would ever want a leader

who does that the answer is lots of

people many people support Tudor Tate

not despite his authoritarian tendencies

but because of them

the way Filipinos have become too

disorderly and comfortable I think we

need a president that can implement

measures and discipline us it's so

obvious that the media is biased because

they only show the killings why don't

they show the other stuff he's doing

like all the infrastructure he's

building wait what

anything credible to hear someone click

brushing off killings and complaining

that more attention to be paid to

infrastructure she must be the only

person in the world who could hear a

story about a government death squad

throwing someone off a bridge you say

wait tell me more about that bridge

sturdy enough for a whole squad you say

very impressive as we've gone through

each of these traits you may have found

yourself thinking uh-oh some of these

are ringing a bell so unfortunately we

do now have to bring the story back

around to this guy our current president

because he definitely exhibits many of

the things that you've seen so far

tonight

he loves appearing strong he actually

wanted a military parade and when it

comes to demonizing enemies

he's gleefully gone after immigrants and

other marginalized groups as well as

picking aggressively optional battles

with Canada the NFL Mark Cuban the FBI

Robert DeNiro

the 2017 Emmy Awards Puerto Rico the

postal service an upscale farm-to-table

restaurant in Lexington Virginia the NSA

levar ball the city of Chicago the Mayor

of London the CEO of Merck Nordstrom and

Chrissy Teigen and that is only

counting the Twitter feuds and Trump has

openly expressed admiration for many of

the authoritarians you've seen including

specifically praising Tudor tea for the

unbelievable job he was doing cleaning

up crime in the Philippines Trump even

once retweeted a parody account that is

attributed to him the quote it is better

to live one day as a lion than a hundred

years as a sheep which isn't actually

something that Trump said it's a slogan

Mussolini used that's right it was

synonymous with pasture Hitler and and

when that was pointed out to Trump this

was his response did you know it was

Rosellini it's okay to know it's Bruce

Elaine yeah look Mussolini was Mussolini

it's okay

it's a very good quote it's a very

interesting quote and I know it I saw it

I saw what I know who said it but what

difference does it make whether it's

Mussolini is somebody else and so

certainly a very interesting quote you

want to be associated with a fascist no

I want to be associated with interesting

quotes okay okay so first let's agree

there's roughly 50% chance that Donald

Trump thinks that Mussolini is just an

Italian moose it's a coin flip and

second if being associated with

interesting quotes is the goal there are

better ones many of them attributing to

people who have committed far fewer war

crimes how about this one another thing

I like to do is give my vagina a little

vitamin D Trump didn't say that shailene

woodley did but it's a very interesting

quote and what I think we should

associate Trump with and it's worth

noting that was from before he was

elected president his entire tone on the

campaign trail was of an unapologetic

strong man I'm gonna bomb the out

of them I don't care like to punch him

in the face I'll tell you Gitmo we're

keeping that open now we're gonna load

it up with bad dudes we're gonna load it

up with a lot of bad dudes what your

works okay folks don't you know I have

these guys torture doesn't work believe

me it works okay Wow so bomb punch

imprison torture we just need to see

Trump lift a gold bar and do a topless

calendar shoot and we basically got

authoritarian bingo right there and the

thing is people liked that in fact it

may be the thing about Trump they liked

the most

watch how his supporters responded when

he described how Putin deals with

journalists and then they said you know

he's killed reporters and I don't like

that I'm totally against that I by the

way I hate some of these people but I'd

never kill him I hate him no I think no

these people honestly I'll be honest

I'll be honest I would never kill them

I would never do that ah that's safe no

I wouldn't I would never kill him but I

do hate him and I some of them are such

lying disgusting people it's true now

that is legitimately scary because I

know that Trump is kidding there but I'm

not sure that everyone in that audience

is and they are flirting with something

very dangerous because Trump will do

anything if it gets a big enough cheer

the difference between joking about

something and actually doing it is only

about 30 decibels on the

applause-o-meter so so the real worry

here isn't just that Trump sounds like

an authoritarian it's that many people

in this country like the way that sounds

we need somebody's tough Trump just

shows toughness and I love that it's

finally got some busting balls I'm gonna

feel safer in our country with him as a

president let me tell you if Jesus

Christ gets down off the cross and told

me Trump is with Russia I will tell him

hold on a second I need a check with the

president if it's true I honestly don't

know what's more depressing there the

thought of that man believe in it Trump

over Jesus all the thought of Jesus

coming back as someone who won't shut up

about Trump and Russia Jesus we get it

yet we all agree with you but you know

we get it no no I didn't see Maddow

Jesus was she on fire

so it's pretty clear by this point the

Trump shares many characteristics with

authoritarian leaders and yet we're not

currently an authoritarian state so why

is that well thankfully while Trump has

done terrible things as president our

institutions generally speaking so far

have been just strong enough to hold up

against his most authoritarian instincts

he's not managed to shut down the Muller

investigation yet he apparently wants to

end birthright citizenship but that's

not something a president can do and

just this week his efforts to ban a CNN

reporter from the White House were

halted by a judge that he himself had

appointed and that's good but there's no

doubt Trump is testing the system

appointing this well-dressed fire

hydrant as his acting Attorney General

is a worrying sign as are his repeated

attempts to delegitimize elections by

declaring results that he doesn't like

fraudulence so people do need to remain

vigilant and that is the key thing here

because while we may talk about

institutions being strong what that

actually means is that people are

working very hard to protect them and to

use them to contain this president's

worst impulses he's lost in court

because people have sued him he's kept

the Russian investigation going because

his advisors know there would be a

public outcry if he stopped it and to

the extent that Congress is able to

check him going forward it's because

people turned up at the midterms to keep

doing those things because the world is

dabbling with something very dangerous

right now

and America needs to be careful and look

I know democracy can be often by design

frustrating checks and balances can be

irritating and slow and might not

deliver the outcome that you wanted but

removing them opens the door to

something much worse and that is true

whether you live in Russia Turkey

Hungary the Philippines Brazil or yes

the United States and I know that

America is a different country with a

different history and thankfully more

resilient institutions but that is no

cause for complacency because the truth

is the honest answer to could

authoritarianism happen here is and

possibly always will be no I think no

The presidency
of Donald Trump.

The man voted "Least Edible"
by Cannibal Magazine

-six years in a row.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-A-- And I know,
I honestly know

that the prospect
of talking about Trump yet again

feels exhausting.

We're all so tired of him,
every room in America

should have a sign
on the wall that counts

the number of minutes
that it's been

since someone brought up
his fucking name.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-But-- But that is the thing.

Trump's presidency
is like one of his handshakes.

It pulls you in,
whether you like it or not.

He's had so many
terrible moments this year,

you probably forgot about
many of them.

Remember when he creepily told
the French president's wife

-that she was in good shape?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Or-- Or when his
tacky golf resort was touted

on the States Department
website?

Or, when he shoved
the prime minister

of Montenegro out of the way,
 at a NATO event.

Look how proud
 of himself he is!

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Look how proud he is!

You should at least have to know
that Montenegro is a country

before making a move that says,
"Suck it, Montenegro."

And there were also quieter
but no less alarming moments

like when he explained how hard
he's been fighting

to bring "clean coal" back
without appearing to understand

what that actually is.

It's just been announced

that a second
brand new coal mine

where they're going
to take out clean coal,

meaning they're taking
out coal,

-they're gonna clean it,
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

is opening in the state
of Pennsylvania.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Listen, is it possible

that Trump is well-versed
in and is referring to

flue gas desulfurization,
fluidized bed combustion,

and selective
catalytic reduction?

Sure, it's possible,

but let's agree
it's considerably more likely

that he thinks you just
take a bunch of coal

and scrub-a-dub it
with a big ol' sponge.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Oh, yeah, that's right.

I'm saying the president
fundamentally doesn't understand

what he's talking about,
and you know what that means.

-We got him!
-(AIR HORN BLARING)

-♪ (PRESIDENTIAL
THEME SONG PLAYING) ♪
-We got him! We got him!

I got him-- wha--
I didn't get him?

-Did I not get him?
-♪ (MUSIC FLUBS OUT) ♪

I thought-- I thought--
I thought we got him.

I thought-- I thought we got him
that time.

Well, that's fair-- okay.

What? You think I don't
hate myself, too? Alright!

-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-The point is--

The point is tonight...
let's pull back

from the daily
Trump-induced chaos

and take a look at the norms
that his presidency

has violated,
and not the obvious ones,

like the fact that he never
released his tax returns,

or that his own daughter
and son-in-law

work in the White House,
although, admittedly,

I am using the word "work"
there so generously

that I should be able
to deduct it

as a charitable donation
on my taxes.

Or-- Or that instead
of putting his assets

into a blind trust to help
reduce conflicts of interest,

he simply showed America

that he has many
large stacks of paper,

presumable containing
the sentence

"I can't believe
I'm getting away with this,"

printed 750,000 times.

No, instead, we're going
to talk about Trump's assault

on something even more basic,
the norms governing

how our leaders engage
with us,

and how in turn,
that affects the way

that we engage with one another.

It's why even the notion
of "getting him"

can feel so hopelessly futile.

And let's first stipulate
that it definitely doesn't help

that so often what Trump says
is complete nonsense.

We often read transcripts
of Trump's speeches,

and it's something
that everyone should actually do

once in a while,
because when you strip away

his blindly confident
entertaining delivery

and just read his words,
it is staggering

how incoherent he is.

Here is a word-for-word
reading of a speech

where he talked about
the Iran nuclear deal.

(MONOTONE VOICE READS
ON-SCREEN TEXT)

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-(READING CONTINUES)

-(AUDIENCE CACKLING)
-Holy shit.

That is not a functional use
of language,

that is a drunk driver
crashing a pick-up truck

-full of alphabet soup.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Trump's actual speech patterns

sound like when you write
a long text

by choosing only
the predictive text

your iPhone suggests for you.

Seriously, we wrote
a message like that,

starting with the words,
"the nuclear,"

and here is what we got.

(MONOTONE VOICE READS
ON-SCREEN TEXT)

-(AUDIENCE CACKLING)
-That makes exactly as much,

and potentially more sense,
then Trump's speech

about the Iran nuclear deal,
meaning an iPhone

would be a more coherent
president of the United States.

But with Trump,
we are familiar enough

with his speech patterns
that you get the basic gist

of what he's trying to say.

The real damage isn't
in how he says things,

but from three key techniques
that he uses to insulate himself

from criticism and consequence.

And if we are not
extremely careful,

all three could have
serious impacts

that far outlast his presidency,

and let's start
with the first one.

Delegitimizing the media.

Now, Trump has been
attacking the press

since he declared
his candidacy,

and in a broader sense,
he's been waging war

on the very concept of truth

ever since he first
turned to his mom and said,

"Dada," and she said,
"No, I'm mama,"

and he said, "Fake news,"
and shit his pants.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now--

the difference now is,
he's crying fake news

as President
of the United States,

and he is openly proud of it,

to the point that he recently
tried to take ownership

of the term itself.

The media is... is--
really the word--

I think one of the
greatest of all terms

I've come up with is "fake."

I guess other people
have used it perhaps

over the years,
but I've never noticed it.

-(AUDIENCE GROANING)
-He just took credit

for inventing the term
"fake news,"

which, for the record,
he did not,

meaning what he just said

was technically
"fake" fake "news" news.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

A-- And you can imagine
him saying, "Well,

I'm not the first politician
to criticize the press.

What about Hillary Clinton?

What about Barack Obama?

What about Bernie Sanders?

And that actually brings us
to Trump's second technique,

something called
"whataboutism."

It's the practice
of changing the subject

to someone else's
perceived wrongdoing.

Now, Trump does this
all the time,

most famously when he was asked

why he hadn't forcefully
condemned the neo-Nazis

in Charlottesville,
and this was his response...

What about the alt-left
that came charging

at the-- as you say,
the alt-right?

Do they have any
semblance of guilt?

What about the fact
they came charging--

that they came charging
with clubs in their hands,

swinging clubs?

Do they have any... problem?

Well, actually, no,
because a Nazi killing someone

with a car is so heinous,

any other issues that might
be up for debate,

under any other circumstances,
kind of have to wait their turn.

You can be wearing Crocs
with socks,

but if you're using
those socked-Crocs

to kick Hitler in the balls,
do you know what?

I'm suddenly not
so fucking focused

-on the footwear.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Now-- Now this technique
of saying "what about..."

is actually an old Soviet
propaganda tool,

and the reason it is dangerous
is because it implies

that all actions,
regardless of context,

share a moral equivalency,
and since nobody is perfect,

all criticism is hypocritical

and everybody should do
whatever they want.

It is a depressingly
effective tool,

which is why,
on Trump's favorite network,

you hear it all the time.

The mainstream media
focused on the Trump campaign

and allegations
of collusion with the Russians.

But what about the Democrat's
possible ties to Moscow?

FEMALE ANCHOR:
Former national security adviser

General Michael Flynn,

investigated for
his private meeting with Russia,

but what about Hillary Clinton?

The media wants to call
into question the credibility,

uh, and the trustworthiness
of this administration, uh,

but what about Benghazi?
What about the blatant lies

that the Obama
administration told us?

What about the fact that
Ben Rhodes bragged

about lying to the media
and the public

-about the Iran deal?
-HANNITY: Great point.

What about the fact that
Jonathan Gruber

basically said the
American people were stupid?

Okay, stop, stop, stop,
because here is the thing,

none of the errors those people
may have made in the past

excuse the Trump
administration's actions.

A defense attorney could not
stand up in court and say,

"Maybe my client did
murder those people,

but I ask you this...
What about Jeffrey Dahmer?

-What about Al Capone?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

What about the guy from
the Silence of the Lambs?

I rest my case here, people.
I rest my case."

The problem with whataboutism
is it doesn't actually

solve a problem
or win an argument.

The point is just to
muddy the waters

which can make
the other side mad,

and that actually
brings us to Trump's

third technique... trolling.

Now trolling itself
has been around for years.

It's basically 80% of what
happens on the internet.

It's-- it's when a
YouTube commenter

says something
willfully provocative

like saying, "I've aged like
an apple core in a dumpster."

or that I "look like a fucking
pickle with glasses."

Now, it doesn't matter
whether they mean any of that,

the point is just to
get a reaction

and to hurt my feelings
which, by the way,

it absolutely does.

But-- But Trump... Trump may
well be the first ever troll

to be elected president.
And that's right,

I said elected.

Remember tenth president,
Sprinkles Fuzzwizard?

He assumed office after
William Henry Harrison died

and if you're thinking,
"Hold on,

Sprinkles Fuzzwizard was not
America's tenth president"...

Really?

Who was America's
tenth president?

Exactly. Let's assume
I'm right.

The point is, as a troll,
Trump often does things

that have no effect
other than

to piss off
his perceived enemies.

Like when he tweeted
this wrestling GIF

of himself
body slamming CNN,

or attacked Mika Brzezinksi
by saying she was,

"bleeding badly
from a face-lift,"

or, as we mentioned
earlier tonight,

called a leader
with nuclear weapons

"short and fat."

And Trump even once
retweeted a claim

that he was the most
superior troll

on the whole of Twitter,
calling it

"a great compliment."

Which it is not,
because sometimes

when you do something that
makes a lot of people mad,

it's because,
and bear with me here,

-you're a dick.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

If you-- If you sneak
into someone's house

and urinate
in every heating vent

and they get mad at you,
you're not an epic troll

sticking it to the
snowflake cucks,

you're just
some fucking asshole.

But the thing is,
Trump's trolling

is not actually without
political value.

Despite Trump's few real policy
accomplishments to date,

he has consistently achieved
one thing,

and that is making
his enemies unhappy.

And for many Trump supporters,
that itself counts

as a major victory.

Just listen to how
 Fox & Friends reacted

after Trump freaked
people out

by standing
with military leaders

during rising tensions
with North Korea,

and suggesting that it was
the "calm before the storm."

I feel like he's trolling
the media.

He is-- I think he's totally
trolling the media there.

You do something like that--
even the smile and the wink.

Those of us that are sick
of the status quo,

the forgotten men and women
who voted for President Trump,

want that town to freak out.
I want those reporters going,

"What do you mean?
What do you mean?"

It's beautiful to watch.

Is it?

Why?
I'm genuinely serious.

Who benefits from mass confusion
about whether or not

we're about to go to war?

Are there thousands of
unemployed factory workers

across the Midwest going,
"Well the plant closed down

and I lost my healthcare.
But somewhere,

a Washington Post reporter
is scared of dying,

so things are looking up. Mega!"

Judging your political success
on how bad you make

other people feel
makes just about as much sense

as judging your success
as a zookeeper

by how many bears you fuck.

Oh, wow, that is not
your job.

I mean, I guess it's impressive
in its own way,

but it is definitely not what
you're supposed to be doing.

And the surest proof of trolling
often comes

when a troll is confronted.

Because that's when
they have to either

put up or shut up.

You may have heard about
cases where

people tracked down the source
of something awful

that was posted online,
only to find

some sullen fifteen-year-old
who just shrugs and goes,

"Well I don't know why
I wrote that. I just did it.

Stop asking me so many
questions."

Well, that is basically
our president now.

I'll show you.
Remember when Trump said

that Obama had surveilled him
in Trump Tower, tweeting...

"How low has President Obama
gone to tap-p my phones?"

Watch what happens when he
was asked to justify that.

Well, you saw what happened
with surveillance

and I think that was
inappropriate.

-That's the way--
-What does that mean, sir?

Uh, you can figure that out
yourself.

Well I-- The reason I ask
is you said he was--

You called him "sick and bad."

Look, you can figure it out
yourself,

he was very nice to me
with words, but--

and when I was with him,
but after that

there has been no relationship.

But you stand by that claim
about him?

I don't stand by anything.
I just, uh...

You can take it the way
you want.

Okay, so let's walk through
what just happened there.

On the internet he claimed
that his predecessor

committed an extremely
serious crime.

But in person, he is suddenly
backing down.

First saying Obama was
"very nice to me with words,"

then that, "I don't stand
by anything."

Which is one of the most

frighteningly nihilistic
sentences a president can say.

I would honestly rather
hear that

from a clown holding a knife
than a president.

Because at least when
a clown says,

"I don't stand by anything,"
you think,

"Yeah, that kind of makes sense.
Please make it quick."

-And...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

And look, it gets worse, because
that interview kept going

and Trump was explicitly
given the opportunity

to set the record straight
for the "fake news media,"

but he flat-out refused.

I just wanted to
find out that--

You're the president
of the United States,

you said he was "sick and bad"

-because he attacked you--
-You can take it any way--

You can take it any way
you want.

-But I'm asking you, because you
don't want it to be fake news.
-You don't--

-I want to hear it from
President Trump.
-You don't have to ask me.

-You don't have to ask me.
-Why not?

Because I have my own opinions,
you can have your own opinions.

But I want to know
your opinions.

-You're the president
of the United States.
-Okay. That's enough.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Okay, so...

There is a lot that is
infuriating about that clip.

But Trump going back to his desk
and pretending to work hard

is an objectively funny
thing to do.

That's like your dog
avoiding questions

by pretending to do his taxes.
You never do this,

why would you need
to do it now?

Look, while there is nothing new
about any of these techniques,

they are now coming out
of the Oval Office.

Which not only legitimizes them,
it risks them spreading,

and that, sadly, is happening.

Last month,
Congressman Paul Gosar

used all three techniques.

First, he suggested
in an interview

that the march
in Charlottesville

may have been
a false flag operation

created by the left, which is
pretty troll-y behavior.

And when confronted about it,
he deployed the other two tools.

-It's all been debunked.
-It's not been debunked.

Absolutely not debunked
whatsoever.

-So stay tuned.
-The conspiracy theory

that you have put out there
has been debunked.

It has not been debunked.
Look at-- Look at what CNN

has talked about with, uh,
with what's going on

with the Clinton administration
right now with the dossier.

Hardly an aspect
in regards to debunk.

You're not real news,
you're fake news.

Sir, everything you've said
has been debunked,

why are you continuing
to put this out there?

So he's basically just
copying Trump.

And if there is one thing
worse than something terrible,

it's a cover band
of that terrible thing.

If Trump is Nickelback,
that man is Bickleknack.

Not as good at it
as the original,

and a horrible sign
that the disease is spreading.

The problem is
if that becomes

the level of discourse
in this country,

we are seriously
and lastingly fucked.

And just this week,
we saw some of these techniques

pushed to the absolute limit
by the scandal involving

Alabama Senate candidate
Roy Moore,

who has denied allegations
of sexual misconduct

with a 14-year-old
when he was 32

and called them "fake news."

Now, watch Sean Hannity
then use whataboutism

to derail
a discussion about it.

This 14-year old girl,
purportedly,

according to
 The Washington Post,

told two of her girlfriends

-what happened in real time.
-SEAN HANNITY: Here's
a tough question...

Do you think Bill Clinton,
in retrospect, was a predator?

But, that is not what this
discussion is about.

You might as well have said,
"Here's a tough question,

'If you had to guess,
how many lobsters are there?'"

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-"Like total? In the world?"

Is that worth discussing?
Sure, but first let's finish

talking about
the Senate candidate

who may have made sexual
advances on a child.

And, look, whether Clinton
engaged in predatory behavior

is absolutely a legitimate
question, but

it shouldn't really inform
what we do about Roy Moore.

And, even if you believe
the Democrats are guilty

of a double standard,
the solution is not to have

no standard whatsoever.

That is why it's so important
to train ourselves to identify

these techniques because their
natural endpoint

is the erosion of our ability
to decide what's important,

have an honest debate, and hold
one another accountable.

And that erosion
could be so gradual

that it's difficult to spot.

It's like being murdered
by a sloth.

It happens very slowly
and you might not notice

-until it's too late.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Now, listen, this is all
very bleak.

I cannot pretend that it isn't,

which is why it is so important
to take some hope

from this year's small victories
like the Muslim ban

being blocked by the courts
after massive public protests.

-(AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS)
-Or, or, the attempts...

to appeal Obamacare stalling,

thanks in part to people
pressuring their lawmakers.

And, just this week,
just this week in Virginia,

voters rejected Ed Gillespie
for governor

after he ran a Trump-style,
dog-whistle campaign.

And that is encouraging
because it's nice to know that

if you use Trump tactics

in a Virginia gubernatorial
election,

you do not get
to be "gubernator."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Now...

further down the ballot there,

Tuesday also marked the defeat
of Bob Marshall,

who earlier this year proposed
a so-called bathroom bill.

He lost to Danica Roem,
who will now be Virginia's

first openly transgender
legislator.

And the tone that she has taken
is already markedly different.

Danica, you were running
against, um, Robert Marshall,

an incumbent,
thirteen-term incumbent.

He's also a man who referred
to himself

as "Virginia's chief homophobe."

He refused to debate you
 during the campaign.

Do you have anything
you wanna say to him?

Come January, delegate Marshall
will be one of my constituents

and I'm not gonna disrespect
my own constituents.

Wow, that is incredibly
refreshing.

Just think about that.

She beat a man who openly
disrespected her,

but given the opportunity,
she chose not to respond

by tweeting...

(READS TWEET)

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

It's nice! It's nice not
to have that.

And, look, Tuesday's results
should not make you complacent.

They are absolutely no
guarantee that the midterms

will turn out at all well.

That is why, though,

you should take these moments
of encouragement

to help you keep going.

Because the Trump Presidency
is basically a marathon.

It's painful, it's pointless,
and the majority of you

didn't even agree to run it.

You were just signed up by
your dumbest friend.

And-- And the fact is

we are not even at mile six
right now,

or possibly even mile three.

So, there is a long way to go,

and though you're exhausted
and your whole body

is screaming for you to give up,
and your nipples are chafing

for some reason,
the stakes are too high

for any of us to stop.

And, I do realize that
I'm saying that

as we're about to stop doing
shows for the year.

But-- But here's the thing,

we won't actually
be going away entirely.

You might remember
earlier this year,

we used our "Catheter Cowboy"
to try and get information

to the president in the
ad breaks of Fox & Friends.

Well, Trump is still watching
that show and we know this

because The Times wrote
a generally negative piece

about its enormous
influence on him.

And because of that called it

"...the most powerful TV show
in America."

A sentiment that the hosts
were very excited about.

This program,
the program you're watching,

is, according to
 The New York Times,

"...the most powerful TV show
in America."

-TUCKER CARLSON: Wow!
-AINSLEY EARHARDT:
Do you know why Steve?

Because we have
the best viewers.

Yes.

-No.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

No, you don't. Uh,
you-- you absolutely don't.

Oh, an-- and look,
don't misunderstand,

I'm not saying that we have
the best viewers.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)
-No, no. I'm not saying that.

No! I'm explicitly
not saying that.

You guys... are fine.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

The best audience belongs
to Ellen because this

is how they greet her...

ANNOUNCER: Here she is now...
 Ellen DeGeneres.

-(AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS)
-♪ (MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

None of you fuckers did that

-when I came out.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERS LOUDLY)

None of you did it!

But, the point is,
the point here is,

just 45 minutes after that
information was on Fox,

Trump tweeted...

(READS TWEET)

So information goes right
from that show

into his brain,
which is terrible.

Because we would genuinely be
better off if Trump was getting

daily briefings
from an actual fox

and his friends,
a hedgehog and a weasel

with its head stuck
in a tin can.

But, if Trump is going to keep
watching that show,

we are going to spend
our hiatus

sneaking information
through our Catheter Cowboy.

So-- so a number of commercials
are going to be airing

on Fox News over
the next few months.

Here is the first one...

NARRATOR: Attention
 catheter patients...

I'm a professional cowboy.

I use catheters and there's
two things I know.

I don't like pain when I "cath"
and the term "clean coal"

doesn't refer to the physical
act of cleaning coal,

that would be impossible.

Coal is coal. Clean coal is a
marketing term the coal industry

came up with for stuff like

carbon capture
and sequestration,

an expensive process that's
shown limited results at best.

Also, Frederick Douglass
is dead.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-More tomorrow. Bye-bye.

-(AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS)
-That's good information
for him to know.

That will be on Fox in the D.C.
area later this week.

And keep an eye out
for more of them,

because that cowboy has got
a bunch up his sleeve.

The U.S. Virgin Islands
has a governor,

not a president.

Here's a fun fact...

There's actually no federal law
against this,

thanks to something called
the "First Amendment."

Just because Jared Kushner
is smarter than you,

doesn't mean that he's smart.

The Navy Seals
aren't actually seals.

I know buddy.
I was disappointed, too.

There are many non-gold

very appealing.

That's all for now, Donald.
See ya tomorrow.

And, remember, if you're
not enjoying this,

there's no shame in quittin'.

a report by the Natural Resources

of all the food produced in the United

States never gets eaten Americans throw

away 165 billion dollars worth of food

every year that's about 20 pounds per

person every month Americans throw away

enough food every year to fill 730

Americans are throwing out a third or

more of our food and the amount we throw

out has increased by around 50% since

the 1970s at this rate in 40 years when

know we've we've got spinach towards the

back looks like it's perfectly fine

nothing wrong with it we got some some

kale here we got broccoli in the back as

well we have plenty of produce to make a

salad here oh not just a salad you could

make a significantly better salad than

the salads they actually sell at

McDonald's which look like the trimmings

in Ronald McDonald's lawnmower mixed

with grimace ejaculate and the thing is

watching all that food go from farm to

not a table is awful for a bunch of

reasons first and most obviously there

are many people in this country who

needs that food in 2013 nearly 50

million Americans lived in food-insecure

households meaning that at some point in

the year they struggled to put enough

food on the table and the fact that we

throw away a third of our food gets

pretty alarming when you hear from some

of those people that's hard I'll go

without food before my kids will budget

down to the penny in it

it's not enough yeah it brings you the

tears yeah it's just hard they're so

young and it's hard it is crazy that

that is happening in a country with 730

football stadiums full of uneaten food

it's insane but there are also other

less obvious consequences to discarding

food for a start

we're wasting all the labor and natural

resources that went into making it and

at a time when the landscape of

California is shriveling up like a

pumpkin in front of a house with a lazy

dad it seems especially unwise the

farmers are pumping water into food that

ends up being used as a garnish for

landfills because those landfills go on

to cause problems of their own

if you were to throw an apple corer or

just out into the woods it's not a big

deal problem comes when all of that

waste is aggregated and it decomposes

without air in a landfill that anaerobic

condition is what creates methane which

is a greenhouse gas that's more than 20

times as potent as co2 at trapping heat

that's right when we dump food into a

landfill we're essentially throwing a

trash blanket over a flatulent food man

and Dutch oven in the entire planet and

if you're thinking but but hold on John

what if I'm an asshole who couldn't give

a about America's hungry families

or the long-term viability of life on

Earth well first let me say mr. Trump

thank you so much for taking the time

secondly there is a selfish financial

reason for you to care about this story

- in our households were wasting

somewhere between 15 and 25 percent of

the food that we're buying you know

that's expensive

I mean imagine walking out of a grocery

store with four bags of groceries

dropping one in the parking lot and just

not bothering to pick it up and that's

essentially what we're doing in our

homes today and that's not good when

you're throwing away that much food

you're not just being wasteful you're

wining and dining raccoons oh this is

absolutely lovely thanks for this we

needed a break from the kids it's a good

thing so many of us have access to

plenty of relatively inexpensive food I

love the fact that we live in a country

with Cap'n Crunch peanut butter crunch

chocolatey crunch sprinkled donut crunch

cinnamon roll crunch Christmas crunch

and Halloween crunch I will even defend

oops or berries crunch a cereal so

unnecessary that its actual name

includes an apology for its existence

but it does seem it does seem like our

food wastage is getting to a critical

mass and so much of it stems from our

own habits and misconceptions

for instance stores big and small often

routinely overstock so that you can walk

in and see tons of food there because if

they don't do that as this small farm

stand operator describes it we might not

buy anything

and there was an hour left in the market

that one bunch of charge would sit there

and no one would buy it but if I had 30

bunches of charge of--like bursting out

I probably sell like 25 verses in charge

so what is that saving people are

totally imposters and they think if

there's one that there's something wrong

it's true I wouldn't buy that child

partly because it's charge but mainly

because we naturally assume the last

option is a bad option which in many

contexts is absolutely the case for

example you don't want the last magazine

in the doctor's office because it's

always Golf Digest always and no one has

ever read Golf Digest that's not even a

golf club in his hand but no one noticed

because it's on Golf Digest but when it

comes to produce the last option is

probably completely fine especially

because as another farmer explains even

slightly subpar fruits and vegetables

don't make it to the produce aisle every

time that the people are picking they'll

have a few they throw on the ground

because there's always a few that aren't

quite perfect this is a perfectly good

peach right on the ground like this oh

my god if you just look down this way

it's like a bounty look at that and the

reason that happens is that if a peach

doesn't meet strict aesthetic standards

it might not be worth a farmer even

trying to sell it our produce oils have

become a lot like Leonardo DiCaprio's

penis exclusively accessible to the

physically flawless

body-shaming is actually so ingrained

it's reflected in the USDA's grading

standards just look at the visual

grading standards for peaches this is a

number one peach and of course it is

that's an undeniably beautiful peach oh

I want to buy that peach dinner and

it whereas whereas embrace yourself this

is a number-2 peach and that is an

abomination unto the Lord and as soon as

it is labeled a number two it can lose

two-thirds of its market value to a

farmer even though its contents are the

same and many retailers have standards

even more strict than the USDA s all of

which is why so many peaches end up

being thrown on the ground to rot and

that should not be how we treat our

fruit it should only be how we treat our

celebrities so help me God Channing

Tatum you lose one muscle fiber on that

six-pack and I will personally toss you

into Hollywood's landfill you keep it

tight Tatum hashtag keep it tight tater

we don't just reject food because of how

it looks sometimes we do it out of pure

fear according to one estimate 91% of us

have thrown out food that's past its

sell-by dates because we're afraid it's

not safe and I am absolutely part of

that 91%

we're weirdly reverent towards these

dates even when they make no sense

use buy sell buy and nothing but just

that date and this is all the same brand

this is all the same brand this is not

only the same brand but also the same 2%

show us this shows there's a complete

confusion out there the only labels on

food more meaningless than those are the

ones on Smirnoff bottles that say triple

distilled vodka really Smirnoff so you

ran the potato sweats through the tube

sock two extra times thanks for spending

the effort we naturally assume sell by

dates reflect a uniform standard of

safety but that is not true well

actually there's nothing to do a safety

at all it's just a manufacturers best

guess of wine that food is gonna be the

freshest and at the best quality exactly

those dates are decided on by

manufacturers and if I were a food

manufacturer I would make those dates as

tight as possible to convince people to

buy a new one of my products because

unlike apple I can't just create a new

operating system that suddenly means

your old cereal is incompatible with

your mouth the truth is with the

exception of baby formula the federal

government does not require any food to

carry an expiration date and state laws

vary widely with nine states not

requiring any date labels at all which

means most of the time sell by dates are

one of those things that look official

but you can probably ignore like a child

in a cop uniform just to stop it Tyler

are not under a West you are under a

West

but because we think those dates are

real many supermarkets throw expired

food out even before its sell-by date

and they don't donate it for what they

think is a pretty good reason

everything that's closed dated or any

calls no we can't you can't it's a

safety you can't if you guys donate it

then or you don't donate it so if it was

straight in the garbage they go straight

in the garbage history losses have you

guys been sued before that's a common

misconception we all think that if you

donate food and someone gets sick if you

get sued I thought that until earlier

this week but we looked into it and

couldn't find a single case where a food

donor has been sued it doesn't happen

it's a false fear like believing if you

go in the water after eating you'll get

a cramp and drown yeah it turns out that

isn't true either this week has blown my

mind because the system is if you donate

food to a charity you're covered by the

Emerson Act which says you cannot be

sued if you make a food donation in good

faith you presumably get the same cover

with donating clothes even though in

some cases there you really should be

sued donating a cowl-neck sweater hello

the homeless live in shelters not for

2008

Oh

yes here's the problem even if more

people understood that there would still

be food that doesn't get to people who

need it for a critical reason

Harold McClure D of HMC farms says he'd

like to donate more of his peaches to

the food banks but getting it into the

hands of somebody to eat it isn't isn't

free there's got to be an economic

incentive to move more of this into an

avenue that food banks couldn't take

advantage of it's a lot easier and

cheaper just to base it throw it away

and that may be the biggest issue of all

for businesses donating food is

genuinely expensive you've got to box it

store it coordinate deliveries for it

there's a lot of overheads

and you cannot fault companies for

caring about their bottom line in the

same way you can't fault a dog for

caring about licking its balls

it's what dogs do it's natural and dog

balls are delicious companies in their

defense are not charities which is why

they should be incentivized to donate

food with tax breaks large corporations

already get one but annoyingly that same

break for small businesses is not a

permanent part of the tax code meaning

that Congress has to keep renewing it

and that's a problem because family

farms or local restaurants may not know

if they're going to get that break at

the end of the year and therefore

whether donating food will be

financially viable for them it's a

ridiculous system which problem prevents

a lot of food from being donated so here

is the good news in February this year a

congressman proposed HR 640 for the

fighting hunger incentive Act to make

that tax break permanent here actually

is one of the bill's sponsors it's time

to get rid of these short-term fixes

embrace long-term solutions this

legislation simply makes the provisions

permanent and when you think about it

that's important because when

something's not permanent it affects our

behavior that's what we all treat rental

cars like we're in a fast and furious

movie I'm sorry sharp turn ahead get

ready to drift Kia Sorento

now now you'll be happy to hear that

bill passed the house however by the

time it did it had been bundled together

with other unpaid for tax breaks and

retitled the America gives more act but

still that original provision was in

there which means this problem has been

solved the show is over we can roll

credits and all live happily ever after

right no not right because when the bill

got to the Senate they and I honestly

did not know this was even possible they

removed everything from inside the bill

retitled it the trade facilitation and

trade Enforcement Act of 2015 and

refilled it with completely different

language concerning border control and

us-israeli relations which meant yes HR

644 passed just with a completely

different title and completely different

contents it's like going to a restaurant

ordering a veggie burger and having the

way to say here you go we made out of

meatloaf and we call it a waffle and

then you can't even say well I don't

want this give it to someone who needs

it because they can't because they don't

know whether or not they'll get a

tax credit for it

the same thing everyone basically agrees

small businesses should get tax

incentives to donate food so we have to

find a way to pass that but even if we

do it will be one small part of what

needs to be a much bigger solution from

and resolving to eat uglier fruit to

taking expiration dates with a pinch of

salt to no longer worrying about getting

sued by high-powered lawyers

representing the hungry

we all have to address our relationship

with food waste or at the very least our

cheeseburger commercials are gonna have

to get a lot more honest what's more

American than a cheeseburger this

cheeseburger loaded with a hot dog and

potato chips in the hands of a model in

a hot tub in a pickup truck on an

aircraft carrier in front of the Statue

of Liberty I'll tell you what's more

American if that cheese burgers that

thrown away along with 15 other

cheeseburgers in front of a food

insecure family for who frankly cannot

believe their eyes as they stand on top

of 14 tons of perfectly edible if

aesthetically unappealing fruits and

vegetables which in turn sits on top of

80 tons of dairy products all one day

patched their arbitrary sell-by dates

all of which sits inside a tear rolling

down Abraham Lincoln's face on Mount

Rushmore which is now nearly chin deep

and millions of discarded cheeseburgers

all gradually decomposing and emitting

flammable methane

red white and blue that is king of

America I think that this can cost you

in your hardest

you

trait the basic system of barter an

exchange that you have to do really

carefully or you'll end up with Dwight

Howard Syria seriously parents talk to

your children about trade you don't want

to go to school with Peter Lunchables

and coming home with Dwight Howard the

baby's gonna add a three-point shot to

his game now kids grow up no trade trade

is a subject on which our current

president considers himself particularly

expert trade that's what I'm gonna do so

good I'll take those traders and make

them so good that's what I do

I love taking bad deals and making them

good I love trade you know trades always

been my thing I could name ten different

forms of trade I know every one of them

hey the Wharton School of Finance right

here yeah I can name ten forms of trade

there's a free trade fair trade Rough

Trade Trader Joe's that's what eight

then there's human trafficking that's

like trading for people well rounded up

and call it ten Wharton School of

Finance Roy here Thomas talked a big

game on trade for decades and he spent

this year slapping tariffs on products

from China Canada the EU and others

prompting them to retaliate with tariffs

of their own and this trade war has

escalated fast from tariffs on just 18

products at the start of the year to now

over 10,000 so things have gotten pretty

serious and American workers are already

being impacted particularly in

agriculture we're feeling a lot of pain

right now in in the farm sector it's

affecting farmers a negative way I

always hope that one morning president

Trump's just going to wake up and and

send out that 3:30 in the morning tweet

that says tariffs are gone wow that is a

depressing thought so that guy's

livelihood depends on a tweet that says

tariffs are gone and even if Trump does

end up doing that at 3:30 in the morning

you just know it'll say tariffs a goon

and we'll all have to decide what he

meant by that so tonight before things

get much worse let's take a look at this

trade war because it's tempting to think

that Trump has a plan after all trade is

his thing and he's tweeted trade wars

are good and easy to win but for years

his strategy on that seems to have been

based around little more than tone of

voice so easy I drop a 25% tax on China

and

and you know I said to somebody that is

really the messenger the messenger is

important I could have one man say we're

gonna tax you 25% and I could say

another listen your we're

gonna tax you 25% oh I see okay so the

tone is important so if I were to say to

somebody that's not how trade

negotiations work that would be one

thing but if I were to say that's not

how trade negotiations work you're dumb

that would be much more

effective there are some very basic

things about economics that he seems

genuinely confused by take tariffs Trump

wants tweeted that if the trade war

doesn't end other countries will pay us

vast sums of money in the form of

tariffs we win either way but that's not

how tariffs work tariffs are taxes

designed to make foreign goods more

expensive therefore making domestic

products more appealing other countries

don't pay us tariffs importers here too

when they receive the goods and they

usually pass that cost along to the

consumer so when Trump imposes a tariff

on an item you are probably going to pay

more for it as reporters have been

trying to explain in the most literal

way possible here in the kitchen

made in China utensils and appliances

like stoves and refrigerators are being

targeted upstairs in the bathroom

everyday items like shampoo nail

clippers makeup and towels could mean

higher prices for things like instant

coffee and this harley-davidson

motorcycle everyday items like the iPad

could be hid the tablet has a chip from

Intel which could be a target East

Cooter's have taken off this year now

they face a 25% tariff okay I hate to

admit this but if one of the key

casualties of this trade war is e

scooters I actually think I'm fine with

that

well basically is Dane Cook somehow

became transportation

and it's not it's not just tariffs that

Trump seems to misunderstand there's

also our trades deficits basically the

number that expresses how much more we

buy from other countries than they buy

from us Trump talks about it all the

time usually like this our trade deficit

ballooned to 817 billion dollars think

of that we lost 817 billion dollars a

year over the last number of years in

trade in other words if we didn't trade

we'd save a hell of a lot of money okay

okay so there's a lot to unpack there

first our trade deficit is actually 552

billion so he was off by a quarter

trillion dollars water school of finance

right there a second trade deficit

aren't actually always bad and many

economists believe for very complex

reasons involving savings rates and the

dollar special status as the world's

reserve currency that America's trade

balance might be more or less where it

should be and finally and this is

important when we have a trade deficit

we don't lose money it's not a big pile

of cash that we handed over we bought

things that we received and I'm not

saying that it was all valuable does

anyone really need the pony up daddy

saddle which allows your child to

symbolize their newfound dominance over

your life no I didn't need it but I

wanted it and honestly it's brought my

dad and me closer together even the

world leaders that Trump has been

fighting with seem alarmed by how little

he understands trade EU Chief

jean-claude juncker reportedly met Trump

armed with a series of colorful simple

flashcards to explain the trade war and

the work that really gets me there is

colorful because that means that means

that they have some simple flashcards

and thought no too wonky let's get some

big fun baby colors on those things

let's give him a chance and Angela

Merkel struggled to explain something

even more basic the independent

newspaper setting an unnamed senior

German official ten times Trump asked ms

merkel if he could negotiate a trade

deal with Germany every time she replied

you can't do a trade deal with Germany

only the

on the 11th refusal Trump finally got

the message Oh we'll do a deal with

Europe then so he understood but only

after the 11th refusal just listen to

what that sounds like

deal with Europe ha deal with your ha

deal with your ha deal with York ha deal

with your ha

deal with your car deal with your car

[Applause]

deal with your honestly I'm just amazed

that after the fifth time Angela Merkel

didn't turn to our translator and say

okay you're fired you can't

possibly be translating this right I'm

not I am not saying that it's easy to

understand trade it's one of the most

complicated issues there is technically

politically and emotionally over the

years free trade has been criticized

from all sides and people argue that

unfettered trade can reward the worst

behavior of multinational companies and

exploit countries with fewer protections

for labor and that has unquestionably

happened but Trump generally confines

himself to arguing that trade is

responsible for the death of US

manufacturing jobs and while there is

some truth in that automation is the far

bigger culprit we actually still make a

lot of things in America US factories

now manufacture twice as much as they

did in 1984 but they do it with 1/3

fewer workers and the overwhelming

consensus among economists is that trade

between countries generally speaking can

create jobs lower costs and be a net

benefit to both nations essentially

think of trade like sex if you're doing

it right it can be good for both

partners though the odds of that

happening plummet as soon as Donald

Trump gets involved and the problem the

real problem with Trump not

understanding trade is that he therefore

doesn't understand its consequences for

instance one of the first major shots he

fired in this trade war was putting

tariffs on steel and aluminum that was

great news for the people working in

those specific industries like this

worker in a Missouri aluminum plant you

you think that his policies are kind of

why you have a job today I know what is

you know it is yeah I want to have a job

offer if it didn't happen wish I could

meet him and give him big old hug

you know yeah I do know and I honestly

get why he wants to hug him Trump got

him his job back is one of two possible

explanations for that man wanting to hug

Donald Trump but the other of course

being that if during the early stages of

the campaign Trump and Melania were

driving through Missouri on a stormy

night and their car broke down Donald's

not getting out some Melania ends up

climbing out into the rain and opening

the hood as that aluminum worker comes

driving down the highway he rolls down

his window and asks if he can help to

which Melania gratefully asked maybe a

flashlight and just if the aluminum

worker is handing the flashlight over it

gets struck by lightning and they switch

bodies

so now Donald is living in the White

House with an aluminum worker who feels

understandably weird about holding his

hat while Melania is forced to point

after her husband from the factory floor

her heart's aching for him every second

of every day knowing full well that

revealing her true identity would just

complicate things for everyone but

that's Melania you go to him

the world will accept your love that

aluminum worker clearly isn't in love

with him everyone can see it and its

players so much

but that individual guy in that

individual job things have improved but

when it comes to trade nothing happens

in isolation and then there are

downstream effects to those tariffs not

too far from where that guy works there

is an eighth nail factory which suffered

because thanks to Trump steel tariffs

the price of their raw material steel

skyrocketed sales dropped in half and

they've laid off over a hundred workers

and those that remain are worried some

of these people this is the only ink of

their guide just like me this is the

only thing inked up I got and I got to

put another daughter through school you

know it's very hard yeah it is that's

the problem here protecting steel help

steel but it hurts anything made from it

and you have to balance those

consequences by one estimate Trump's

tariffs may create 26,000 jobs in steel

and aluminum but could cost over 400,000

jobs across the rest of the economy so

if trump's trying to create jobs almost

anything would be a better idea than

tariffs he'd be better off dressing a

turtle up like david bowie and throwing

him into a pool full of milk will that

create jobs of course not but it won't

actively lose hundreds of thousands of

them plus it'll be the highlight of

ziggy she'll dusts life and listen

listen we're still only scratching the

surface of how complicated this is

because distinguishing between a foreign

product and an american job can be a lot

trickier than you'd think

take some of trumps favorite villains

when it comes to foreign companies they

sell mercedes and BMW and the cars come

in by the millions and we hardly tax

them at all we can't do this stuff

anymore

we protect Germany Germany who doesn't

have a BMW we're gonna tax Mercedes Benz

we're gonna tax BMW we're gonna tax all

of those beautiful Mercedes Benzes that

are coming in at wicked attacks BMWs

that are coming in Trump is furious with

German cars and here is here's the thing

about that in the clip where he said who

doesn't have a BMW to the crowd in his

classic man-of-the-people way so trunk

is actually in North Augusta

South Carolina and just two hours drive

away is a place called Spartanburg

County

well known for this Spartanburg is home

to the largest BMW plant in the world

last year they made more than 370

thousand luxury SUVs employing 10,000

people pumping billions into the state's

economy yeah it seems Trump didn't know

that look everyone knows he doesn't know

a lot of things but occasionally it's

important to remember that he also

doesn't know anything it's true it's

true I'll show you

everyone close your eyes right now and

think of something that thing you're

thinking of he doesn't know that and

since the trade war began Spartanburg

County is actually double because

they'll be affected by higher costs for

the steel that they use to build the

cars and when they try to ship them to

China

they'll be hit by Chinese tariffs so

they are in complicated trouble or as

Trump might put it listen your

you get in tax twice so so

if a trade war could be this disruptive

and the net benefits are likely to be

this negative why is Trump doing this

especially because members of his own

economic team seem against it Gary Cohn

reportedly left over the proposed

tariffs and Steve minuchin Treasury

secretary and white hot sex bomb has has

tried to do some damage control by

claiming we're not actually in a trade

war at all this has been a trade dispute

all along it never was a trade war it's

a trade dispute oh I get it it's not a

war it's a dispute you know what I

always almost bought that

because I'm so distracted by this

lavaridge sex volcanoes looks the guy's

hypnotic I must have a bad case of the

Manucci 'he's right now because he's

looking like an absolute snack so so who

is who is telling the president that

this is a good idea well by most

accounts the driving force is Peter

Navarro head of the Office of Trade and

manufacturing policy

he's Trump's trade guy isn't that right

Peter I'm the trade guy thanks Peter

so so just just for the record let's all

get our Trump administration role

straight we've got trade guy Lyle ad

nothing boy Jesus please a word ghoul

crime nymph drunk grandpa and daughter

wife it's a it's a well-oiled machine

he's running

now Navarro is the author of a series of

get rich investment books and like Trump

he's obsessed with trade deficits in

general and China in particular saying

trade with China is a zero-sum game

meaning one country can only win if the

other country loses and it is hard to

overstate just how rare his views are

among economists when the New Yorker

profiled him they asked a Varro to help

them find even one colleague who agreed

with him he gave them two names one was

Peter Murray see a University of

Maryland professor who said of Navarro

he has a rather severe position that

zero-sum statement I have a problem with

that

where's his proof and the other was a

blogger named Allen Tolson who Navarro

described as a fine economist to which

Thomson replied I do not hold an

economics degree and I'm guessing

Thomson also doesn't hold a degree in

web design because this is the photo on

the about page of his blog so if you are

understandably wondering at this point

then how on earth did Navarro get a job

at the White House well it is

way dumber than you are thinking

apparently Jared Kushner was tasked with

finding Trump experts on Chinese trade

and this is how he went about it so

Jared went on Amazon

he fired up his computer and he found

some of Peter Navarro's books and he

asked him to come to the White House

that's how Peter Navarro ended up in the

White House yeah Jared looked for

experts on Amazon that was his rigorous

process so when Jeff Sessions does get

fired be prepared for him to be replaced

by crystal kaswell author of the erotic

fiction novel dangerous rock a dangerous

noise novel because for whatever reason

that is honestly the first thing that

came up when we typed good law person

parentheses smart into a bizarre

now the Navarro book that Jarrett found

was called death by China and it paints

the u.s. Chinese trade relationship in

apocalyptic terms because while there

are some legitimate complaints about

China's unfair practices they've

deliberately depressed their currency

they violate intellectual property

rights and arguably skirts WTO rules

this book goes way further with chapter

titles featuring phrases like

shanghaiing the gene pool and look mark

there's a death star pointing at Chicago

and Navarro actually turned the book

into a movie that one critic called the

documentary equivalent of a raving

street corner derelict which seems harsh

until you see how the movie begins the

film you're about to she addresses one

of the most urgent problems facing

America

it's increasingly destructive trade

relationship with a rapidly rising China

it starts like that it's warm up is a

literal knife being stabbed into the

heart of America and if you are worried

that that leaves it with nowhere to go

please don't be concerned because there

are even less subtle animations to come

which depict China's trade practices as

guns and bombs that blow up American

factories and stunningly deceptive

moments like this China has stolen

thousands of our factories and millions

of our jobs multinational corporation

profits are soaring and we now all over

three trillion dollars to the world's

largest communist nation I'm not saying

that that large ball isn't very

convincing but our trade deficit isn't

the same as what we owe to China those

are two different numbers and neither of

them is anywhere close to three trillion

dollars and when something that central

to your movie has something that wrong

with it

you usually have to replace it with

Christopher Plummer so so so Navarro is

not someone who any legitimate

economists take seriously and yet he

seems to be the only person the

president is listening to Trump has

called death by China right on and

lauded its facts figures and insight and

Navarro returns the compliment saying of

his own job that my function really as

an economist is to try and provide the

underlying analytics that confirmed

Trump's intuition and his intuition is

always right and that is simply

terrifying because the economists

shouldn't be finding ways to confirm the

intuitions of someone who doesn't know

what they're talking about it's like a

builder working for a child saying my

job is to build this house he designed

which is shaped like an ice-cream cone

with a window that's also a door and the

size of the Sun and a dog his intuitions

are always right no they aren't you need

to stop that child before someone gets

hurt

in fact if you want to get a sense of

just how little Navarro understands the

game he's playing consider this since

this trade war began

China has imposed 37 billion dollars of

tariffs on the u.s. now take a look at

what Navarro said back in March

are you expecting China to come back

with retaliation I don't believe any

country in the world is going to

retaliate for the simple reason that we

are the most lucrative and biggest

market in the world they know they're

cheating us and all we're doing is

standing up for herself it's just

breathtaking to see someone be that

confident and that wrong he's basically

Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic yelling I'm

king of the world except you're not are

you leo you're just an amateur sketch

artist who's about to be murdered by ice

when you put all of this together what

you're left with is this we're engaged

in an escalating trade war that almost

no legitimate economist supports led by

a man who honestly doesn't seem to fully

understand the mechanics of what he's

doing getting advice from the human

equivalent of an all-caps email from

your uncle and the crazy thing is the

effect of all this is the exact opposite

of what Trump says he wants because if

you want to create jobs you don't do

that by cutting off American companies

markets and suppliers and if you want to

curb the abuses of countries like China

you don't do that by pissing off the

leaders of every other nation on earth

and I know that none of what I'm saying

right now will get through to trump so

so maybe it's time to take a page from

one of the only people he's actually

listening to and give him some basic

economic lessons in the only language he

seems to understand the film you're

about to see addresses one of the most

urgent problems facing America the

destruction of basic economic knowledge

by stupidity and the consequences of it

could be disastrous so let's review a

few fundamental facts first a trade

deficit isn't a giant pool of money that

you've lost to another country that's

idiotic

second if you think you can use tariffs

as a weapon you should understand a

tariff isn't something other countries

pay you it's a tax you're forcing your

own people to pay which might end up

hurting them a lot less than it hurts

you

and third our economy is massively

interconnected and you can't just tamper

with one thing without considering what

the water consequences could be

unfortunately misunderstandings just

keep getting bigger while basic

knowledge is shrinking and the result is

stupidity is increasing at an

unsustainable rate listen economics is

incredibly complicated and at the very

least you'll probably shouldn't find

your key economic adviser on

Amazon and the trade guy because his

could end up seriously hurting

us

[Music]

[Applause]

Before our main story tonight,

I'd like to do something
a little different

and just quickly tell you
about a beloved icon

of my childhood,
and it's this man...

WOMAN: For 20 years he made
 the dreams of young people

come true,

with his hugely popular
Jim'll Fix It program.

Best known for his
 trademark jewelry,

track suits, tinted glasses,
 and Havana cigar.

Now, I know it's
hard to believe,

but that bizarre looking man,
Jimmy Savile,

was a national hero.

We named places for him,
we gave him a knighthood,

we even put up
this statue of him,

even though it clearly looks
more like

a cheese sculpture
of George Carlin

-that someone left in the sun.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Now, he had a show called
 Jim'll Fix It,

where he basically
granted wishes.

And like many British kids,
I actually wrote to him.

I asked him

to make me the mascot
for Liverpool football club,

and he never wrote back.

Which I'm actually glad about,
because after he died,

Britain began to find out
who he really was.

And the truth was horrific.

He's gone from a much loved
entertainer,

and respected charity
fundraiser,

to a man described by
Scotland Yard

as a predatory sex offender.

Jimmy Savile's headstone
 was here

for less than three weeks.

His epitaph read,
 "It was good while it lasted."

Oh!

That is an unsettling thing

to have written
on his gravestone.

Although to be fair,
nearly every famous epitaph

would sound horrifying written
on a sex offender's gravestone.

From Dean Martin's "Everybody
loves somebody sometime,"

to Rodney Dangerfield's
"There goes the neighborhood."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-You know, funny, funny.

But if he'd been
a sex offender,

not so much.

The point is, Savile's
headstone was taken down,

as was that sign,
and that creepy statue,

because once we found out
that he was a monster,

we accepted it was
no longer appropriate

to publicly glorify him.

Which actually brings us
to our main story tonight...

the Confederacy.

America's tracksuit
sex offender.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now, in recent years,

there has been a robust debate
over Confederate symbols.

From flags being taken down,
to statues being removed,

to the white nationalist
rallies in Charlottesville.

Both the one that
ended in violence in August,

and another that happened
just last night.

So as this debate is clearly
not going away,

we wanted to take a look
at some of the arguments.

Because you don't
have to look hard

to find people very upset

at the idea of Confederate
statues being taken away.

You can't change history.

You can't pick and choose
what you decide is history.

I think they oughta
just leave 'em alone

and leave 'em
where they are, you know.

They're part of history.

I just don't think
we can erase our history.

It may not represent
the best idea...

that anybody ever came up with.

But nevertheless,
it's part of our history.

And, uh,
I think it should stay there.

You know what,
I'll give him this, he is right

that the Confederacy
and everything that came with it

is, to put it mildly,
"not the best idea...

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-anybody ever came up with."

Because that of course
is making grilled cheese

on a toaster turned sideways.

That is a billion-dollar idea

that is also
completely worthless.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-But they're also right

about one thing.

We should
remember our history,

so tonight, let's do that.

And let's look at the unique
heritage of these symbols.

Starting with the fact
that there are a lot more

than you might expect.

REPORTER:
The Southern Poverty Law Center

found some 1,500 Confederate
 memorials across the country.

More than 700 of them
 are statues and monuments,

and ten U.S. military bases

are named for
 Confederate officers.

Think about that.

There are U.S. military bases
named for Confederate officers.

And they were the enemy.
They killed U.S. soldiers.

That's like finding out that
Nancy Kerrigan

-named her child Tonya Harding.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Why would you do that?
That's a weird choice.

And tributes to the Confederacy
are everywhere in the South,

and notably some
in the North too.

And that map doesn't include
kitschy ways

that the Civil War is presented,
like at this family restaurant:

ANNOUNCER:
 Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede

brings a rip roaring
 taste of America to life.

Dixie's Stampede
 is a musical extravaganza

of sight and sound.

Centered around a friendly
 North-South rivalry,

friendly servers bring
the delicious four course feast

right to you.

Including a whole
 rotisserie chicken,

and all the Pepsi, iced tea,
 or coffee you like.

Yes. That is
a Confederate soldier

serving a small child
all the Pepsi she likes.

Which is still remarkably

only Pepsi's second worst
ad campaign.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
AND CHEERING)

And the thing is if you grew up
with experiences like that,

it can seem like the Civil War
is just a friendly rivalry.

A fun, colorful part
of U.S. history.

But that omits the key fact
about the Civil War.

The Confederacy was fighting for
the preservation of slavery.

And that's not my opinion,
that is just a fact.

There are many ways
that we know this.

Slavery is mentioned in
multiple state's

declarations of secession

with Mississippi saying,

"Our position
is thoroughly identified

with the institution
of slavery."

The Confederate Constitution
contains a clause

enshrining slavery forever.

And then there's the speech
Alexander Stephens,

the Confederate vice president
gave in 1861,

in which he articulated
the basic principles

for the Confederate nation.

ALEXANDER STEPHENS:
 Its foundations are laid.

Its cornerstone rests upon
 the great truth

that the Negro is not
 equal to the white man.

That slavery, subordination
 to the superior race,

is his natural and
 normal condition.

Wow. Subordination to
the superior race.

That is explicit.

If the Confederacy was not
about slavery,

somebody should really
go back in time

and tell the fucking
Confederacy that.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And yet, remarkably,

many people think the Civil War
was over something else.

REPORTER 2: When people
were asked, "What do they think

the main cause
 of the Civil War is?"

48% said,
 "Mainly about states' rights."

Only 38% said,
 "Mainly about slavery."

Nine percent said "both."

And that is amazing.

Only 38% thought the Civil War
was mainly about slavery.

In other words,
look to your left,

now look to your right,

statistically all three of you
live in a country

where only 38% percent of people

-think the Civil War
was mainly about slavery.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And on that "states' rights"
argument, for the record,

the Southern states were
ardently pro-states' rights.

But with some
glaring exceptions.

Notably, when Northern states

passed laws to help protect
runaway slaves,

the South wanted
the federal government

to override those states laws.

So, they loved states' rights,

as long as they were
the right states' rights.

The wrong states' rights
would be states' wrongs,

wrongs which would
need to be righted

by the right states' rights--
look, to put it really simply,

they just wanted to
own black people,

-and they didn't much care how.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

That's a fact!

But that's a very hard fact
for some people to accept.

Especially if a member
of your family

fought for the Confederacy.

And sometimes,
the understandable desire

to want to distance
your relative from that cause

can lead to people
distorting the cause itself.

Just watch as one man

at a community meeting
in North Carolina

defended a Confederate statue

by talking about
his family history.

My great grandfather
was a Confederate soldier.

And I was proud of that.

Because my opinion of his fight

was for his rights.

I don't know what
his rights were.

I wasn't there.

He was dead long before
I came along.

But I'm really concerned
about our monument.

I want it to stay.

It reminds me that I got
a little rebel in me.

You know, we all want to
kind of be independent.

We all have a little
rebel in us, even the ladies.

-Ooh! Even the ladies!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Hashtag feminism,
hashtag confedera-she.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
-And look, look.

I don't know, I don't know

why his great grandfather
fought.

It is hard to know
the motivations

of any individual soldier.

What we do know is that
again, collectively,

they were fighting to preserve
the institution of slavery.

And I do get, honestly,
I honestly get

wanting a more comfortable
history for your family.

But in doing so,
you can't invent

a more comfortable history
for your country.

Because you would be erasing
the actual painful experiences

of many Americans.

As a fellow North Carolinian
explains.

When I walk by this statue,
I-- it becomes very painful

when I think of the suffering
that my ancestors went through.

They enslaved people.

Abused people for their own
economic impact.

And it should not be
 celebrated by these statues.

Right. And that is
the harsh reality

of what was done by
those Confederate men.

And yes, even the ladies,

-hashtag confedera-she.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

If you want to see
a perfect crystallization

of what happens when
two people have

wildly different views
of the same symbol,

just watch this
local news clip.

Why do you carry that flag?

Because this is my heritage.

My family fought
to save their farm

under this flag.

Who was working that farm?

Ooh!

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING IN DISBELIEF)

That is a good, tough question.

And the news clip
actually cut out there,

but we were so intrigued to
find out what his response was

we tracked it down.

And whatever you are expecting,
you're going to be surprised.

-MAN: Who was working that farm?
-My family was!

-Who was working the farm?
-They were poor,

Do you know how much
a slave cost back then?!

-(AUDIENCE SHOUTING)
-Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

You know you are in the wrong

when you decide
your best argument

is screaming at a black man,

"Do you know how expensive
you used to be?!"

It is--

It is comments like that one

that landed this guy
on the cover of

Holy Shit That Is Not
 Remotely The Point magazine.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And look, that-- that is clearly
an intense example.

But denial of this painful
part of history

can take many forms.

Look at PBS's
 Finding Your Roots,

where Henry Louis Gates
explores

celebrities' family histories,

and he often finds some shit.

Famously, Ben Affleck
pulled strings

to get the show
to remove all references

to his slave-owning ancestors.

And though he later apologized,

that impulse right there
is not good.

Because it sanitizes history.

And while there is no
easy way to respond

to learning that kind of
horrible information,

it is worth watching
Anderson Cooper find out

how one relative of his died.

Boykin was murdered by
a rebellious slave.

Wow.

Your ancestor was
beaten to death

with a farm hoe.

(LAUGHS)
Oh my God.

That's amazing.
This is incredible.

(LAUGHS)

I am blown away.

-You think he deserved it?
-ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah.

-Wow. You know what?
-(AUDIENCE CLAPPING)

You know what,
as a general rule,

just try not to live a life

...that could lead a descendant
of yours to one day say,

"A guy smashed
grand-poppy's head in

with a garden hoe?

That's amazing.
Great job 'That Guy!'"

(LAUGHING)

But, my absolute
favorite response

to a nasty surprise,

undoubtedly
comes from Larry David,

who received
a real one-two punch.

Are you telling me that
my great-grandfather

fought for the South?

In the Civil War?

(LAUGHS) What? Are you kidding?

Oh, my goodness...

I hope no slaves show up
on this--

Please turn the page.

(MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER HOLLERS)

Now, Larry, this is
another part of the 18th--

Oh-- oh, you did it!
You did it!

-I knew it! I knew it!
-(GATES LAUGHING)

-Unbelievable!
-Unbelievable.

Boy.

HENRY LOUIS GATES JR:
That's b-- unbelievable.

Oh boy, oh boy.

-Yeah. Prettay, prettay,
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

pretty bad!

Pretty bad!

And look!

Larry David
is not responsible

for what his ancestors did.

None of us are.

I have to believe that,
because I'm English.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And I would like to go

to an Indian restaurant again
at some point in my life.

(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

But-- but we do have to reckon
personally, and as a country

with what our heritage means.

You can't ignore it like Batman,

you can't say
it's something else

like town meeting Santa,

you've got to actively,
painfully,

come to grips with slavery,

and the lasting benefits
and disadvantages

that if conferred.

In ways that, frankly,
we haven't yet.

And that actually brings us back
to Confederate monuments,

because there is
something about them that

that symbolizes our reluctance
to have that conversation

and that is the dates
that they went up.

Because while some
initial memorials

were built mainly in cemeteries,
shortly after the Civil War,

the real surge came
much, much later.

MALE REPORTER 1:
The Southern Poverty Law Center

says a majority

of the more than 700
 Confederate monuments

in public spaces
 across the country,

were erected decades
 after General Lee's surrender.

It's true, as this chart

of the years that
they were dedicated shows,

there was a big spike
from 1900 to 1920

as white southerners were
re-asserting their dominance

through things like
Jim Crow laws,

uh, with another spike in the
50s and 60s

as the Civil Rights Movement
was gaining steam,

so those statues weren't so much

commemorating
recently fallen dead,

as sending
a pretty hostile message

to African-Americans.

And sending messages is kind of
what statues are often for.

This one says,
"We love freedom."

This one says,

"The most notable thing
about our city

-is a fictional character."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

(STAMMERS) And this one says,
"About yay big."

-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
-We still don't know...

what he was trying to measure,
but whatever it was,

-it was... "About yay big."
-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

But... look, for some
Confederate statues though,

for some Confederate statues
the intent is crystal clear.

In that town meeting
from before,

the statue that
they were debating

was this one, which went up
in 1914

and a leader of
that county's chapter of the KKK

gave a speech at its dedication,

calling the occasion
an opportunity

"To recall the achievements
of the great and good

of our own race and blood."

Which, again, is pretty
on-the-nose right there.

And the largest
Confederate memorial,

the carving on Stone Mountain
in Georgia,

is located where the
20th century KKK was born.

It depicts
three Confederate leaders

on horseback, and
it was completed in 1972,

so that means
there is color footage

of the dedication.

After nearly half a century
of work, the memorial carving

here at Stone Mountain
is finally finished.

And officials are calling it
the eighth wonder of the world.

We must recall those principals
of loyalty, dignity and honor

that shine through
the lives of men

we commemorate today.

Yes. That was
Vice President Spiro Agnew

commemorating the loyalty
of literal traitors.

But, what can you really expect
from a man whose name,

rearranged, spells
"Grow a Penis."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And...

and some-- here's the thing.

Some monuments went up
even more recently.

I-- I wanna show you one

that was erected
on private lands,

but very much for
public consumption.

Because once you see it,
you will not forget it.

MALE REPORTER 2:
The statue was erected in 1998.

It portrays
 Nathan Bedford Forrest

on his horse.

Gun in one hand,
 and sword in the other.

Surrounded by
Confederate state battle flags,

visible for all to see
 on the side of I-65.

(CARS DRIVING BY)

MALE REPORTER 2: Forrest was
 a Confederate general

-and an early leader of the KKK.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

That is just
objectively terrifying

regardless of context.

He looks like if a nickel
did cocaine.

-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
-So-- so some of these statues

commemorate people who thought
a war to preserve slavery,

were erected to preserve
white supremacy

and were dedicated by
Klan members and yet,

there is a blanket defense

that tends to get
authored by people

and not just people,
also, this guy.

They're trying to take away...
our culture.

They're trying to take away
our history.

Okay, that argument is
taking these statues down

obliterates history, which is
clearly just ridiculous.

First, monuments are not
how we record history,

books are.

Museums are.

Ken Burns
12-part mini-series are.

Statues are how we
glorify people.

Or, in the case of one in Tokyo,
how we glorify

giant radioactive lizards.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And yet,

the President's concern
seems to be

that tearing down statues
leads to a slippery slope.

This week it's Robert E. Lee.

I noticed that

Stonewall Jackson's
coming down,

I wonder, is it
George Washington next week?

And is it Thomas Jefferson
the week after?

You know, you all--

you really do
have to ask yourself,

"Where does it stop?"

Okay, well,
I'll tell you where it stops.

Somewhere.

Anytime someone asks,
"Where does it stop?"

The answer is always,
"Fucking somewhere!"

You might let your kid
have Twizzlers,

but not inject black-tar heroin.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-You d-- you don't just go,

"Well, after the Twizzlers,
where does it stop?"

-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
-And the same is true

of Confederate monuments.

Think of it this way,
all people, living and dead,

exist on what I'm gonna call
The Hitler-Hanks spectrum,

from bad to good.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)
-And at some point

on the spectrum,

monuments to honor people
are going to be inappropriate.

Although it-- to be fair,

it does get tricky
around the middle,

where, of course, you'll fine
Adolf Hankler.

-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
-And-- and look,

there are clearly people
deserving of statues

who were imperfect humans.

And sometimes our standards
change over time,

which can then get tricky,

because you're judging
historical figures

by modern standards.

But for many
Confederate monuments,

especially those erected
well after the Civil War,

valorizing the cause

or leadership
of the Confederacy,

this really isn't a close call.

This is your babysitter
showing up

in a Jimmy Savile t-shirt.

I don't care what you think
that represents,

you're not staying home
with my fucking kid tonight.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And for Robert E. Lee
in particular,

it's actually even easier
because of this.

MALE REPORTER 1: Interestingly,
 Robert E. Lee was once asked

about placing memorials
 at Gettysburg in 1869.

The former general replied,

"I think it wiser... not to
 keep open the sores of war,

but to follow the examples
 of those nations

who endeavored to obliterate
 the marks of civil strife,

to commit to oblivion
 the feelings engendered."

It's true. Robert E. Lee
was opposed to statues

of people like Robert E. Lee.

So, any city that decides
to keep a statue of him

should at the very least
add a speech bubble saying,

"You know, I told you all
specifically, not to do this."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

So-- so what do we do now?

Well-- well, I would argue
that nothing is not acceptable,

and-- and trying
to paper over the cracks

can actually make things worse.

In the 1990s, Richmond tried
to fix its Monument Avenue,

a street lined with statues
of Confederate leaders

by adding
African-American tennis legend,

Arthur Ashe to it.

And you can't just
give Confederates a black friend

and say, "We're good, right?"

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-We're good! Arthur's up there!

You love Arthur!

So-- so, if we really want
to learn from,

and honor our history,
perhaps the first step

might be to put
most of these statues

somewhere more appropriate,

surrounded by
ample historical context,

like in a museum.

Where people go to
proactively learn about history,

and also
to punish their children.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And please,

try not to think of this
as a loss,

because it's actually
a real opportunity,

and I'll show you, please.

Come with me.

-♪ (PATRIOTIC MUSIC PLAYING) ♪
-Because if and when

a pleat becomes empty,

that is a chance for your area
to honor someone

who really deserves it.

A-- And I have some--
some ideas for replacements

that I would love
to run by you.

First, Beaufort County,
South Carolina,

how about
a giant statue of...

Robert Smalls here?

He was born into slavery.

He stole a Confederate boat,
and he sailed it to freedom,

and later served five terms
in Congress.

This guy is amazing.

Atlanta, Texas.

You are the birthplace to...

Bessie Coleman.

The first
African-American woman pilot.

-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-Why would you not want this
in your town? She's incredible!

Now, Florida.

You might not want
an individual,

but how 'bout something
that honors

what your state represents?

Something that says,

"You've got
a little rebel in you."

So, I give you this statue

of your
official state reptile...

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-an alligator

giving everyone the finger.

He's called Herman,

and he definitely says Florida,

while also having
nothing to do with slavery.

And finally,
finally, there is Charleston,

and to you, I say this.

Why have a divisive,
Confederate statue when instead,

that pedestal can be filled
by your favorite son,

-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-the actual Stephen Colbert,

who will stand up there
all day

telling you fun facts
about your wonderful town.

-JOHN OLIVER: Right?
-Yes.

-OLIVER: Really?
-Yes.

Charleston. Charleston.

Charleston is the site

-That's fascinating, Stephen.

Every year,
we host Zugunruhefest,

the Southeast's
most comprehensive

migration-focused
birding festival.

That sounds incredible,
I'll google it!

See Charleston?

You can have this

class of juniors has ever managed to

agree on is that The Scarlet Letter

could be told much simpler with emojis

we got it read lady finger finger devil

baby we've all read the book is a good

story that American students are sick of

tests between benchmarks diagnostic

spree and mock tests they take a lot of

them students are taking between 10 and

20 standardized tests depending on the

grade a total average of 113 different

ones by graduation 113 is a lot of tests

it's approaching the amount that you'd

ask your doctor for the morning after

you woke up from a one-night stand with

Colin Farrell just just give me all of

them twice and this amount of testing

can take a toll teachers have reported

kids throwing up kids crying especially

the younger ones and it's the pressure

that's true in fact this happens so much

that official instructions for test

administrators specify what to do if a

student vomits on his or her test

booklet and something is wrong with our

system when we just assume a certain

number of kids will vomit tests are

supposed to be assessment of skills not

a rap battle on 8 Mile Road

Oh mmm why did your mom make you

spaghetti

she knew tonight was rapid battle nights

so how did we get here what the

explosion of testing can be traced back

to the 90s when you probably remember

stories like these about the state of

public education

when 40 Nations recently took the

International math and science test

American students scored near the bottom

and that must have hurt especially

because you knew the French children

weren't even trying go on play with your

silly numbers they tell you nothing of

the true nature of the solar a week

before you in response to statistics

like that

President George W Bush on just his

third day in office announced his No

Child Left Behind program it passed

Congress with bipartisan support because

of course it did voting against No Child

Left Behind is like voting against no

puppy left unsnag 'old what what monster

would do that

his name is patches and he needs love

the program was designed to be

data-driven and involved testing

children every single year in order to

identify and fix failing schools in the

counter billi system must have a

consequence otherwise it's not much of

an accountability system it's hard to

argue with any of that

unfortunately accountability is one of

those concepts that everybody's in favor

of but nobody knows how to make work

like synergy or maxi dresses no matter

who wears them they look like a poncho

to waterfall you look like the ghost of

Gwyneth Paltrow future I only haunt

Branch goo

No Child Left Behind increase the number

of federally mandated tests from 6 to 17

and the fixation on testing was

something which our current president

seemed to be against as he ran for

office don't tell us that the only way

to teach a child is to spend too much of

a year preparing him to fill out a few

bubbles in a standardized test we know

that's not true

Wow that man knew how to pander to

teachers and yet you know what else they

should be pool tables and the teachers

lounge and every year you should be able

to slap one parents vote for me I'm out

of here

what's this breakthrough took office he

didn't get rid of tests instead he added

his own education initiatives like race

to the top which encourage states to

adopt the common core which featured a

logo of snails sixty-nining and again

the intentions here were good because we

do have underperforming schools and

there are major economic and racial

disparities in the quality of education

children receive and anything that can

help us narrow those gaps is obviously a

good thing the problem has been the

implementation for instance many states

now tie teacher pay to performance using

one particular approach

it's called value-added analysis rating

teachers based on student test scores

for instance if a student who ranked in

the 60th percentile test higher at the

end of the year

the teacher gets a better rating if the

student Falls the teachers rating Falls

okay well that explains why many

teachers class and decorations that used

to read believe in yourself now say

don't come me on this

and what well the idea of trying teacher

pay to student improvement sounds great

in theory here's how it can work in

practice I have four students who's

predicted scores were literally

impossible one of my sixth-grade

students had a predicted score of 286

point three four however the highest a

sixth grade student can earn is 283 the

student did earn a 283 incidentally

despite the fact she earned a perfect

score

she counted negatively towards my

evaluation because she was three points

below her predicted score that is

ridiculous the only way she could have

hit her predicted score was if she

answered everything right roped a few

extra questions of her own got those

right and then stapled them to the test

that teacher lives in Florida which uses

this formula to assess teachers a

formula which looks like the kind of

thing that aliens carve into an

anti-semites cornfield and many of these

formulas on which teachers careers

depend were partly inspired by research

and this is true that modeled the

reproductive trends of livestock

basically we judge the nuance of what

happens in the complicated world of a

child's mind the same way that we judge

this look I don't know what we did wrong

but your child is going to either pass

algebra or birth a healthy calf I don't

know flip a coin with the stakes this

high the tests had better be good but

there is ample reason to suspect that

that is not the case just look at the

Florida Comprehensive Assessment test or

FCAT a Florida school board member was

concerned and a little suspicious when

he learned that only 39% of his state's

tenth graders had performed at or above

grade level in reading so we had an idea

I asked the district at that point to

give me the closest thing they could

legally to the FCAT reading and math

test and I took it that test labeled me

as a poor reader and I have a couple of

master's degrees and I've been reelected

four times and I teach 39 graduate

courses at six universities in this

country okay okay okay

we get it the test sucks anything else

you want to brag about there I also know

how to play mary had a little lamb on

the recorder and guess who could do 16

non-consecutive push-ups King guy look

he does have a point he does have a

point if a test fails to reflect ability

there are human consequences because one

shy Florida eighth grader who had a

near-perfect score in her advanced

language arts class was asked to leave

it last year due to her inexplicably low

scores on the FCAT and last fall she

told a school board meeting exactly how

that felt every year I do good in school

but I get locusts but I get low test

scores on the up cap and it feels like

it's much of the stomach this is unfair

and I don't want to lose my opportunity

to take my classes or get because what

test that is just awful I take back

everything I said about wanting to take

a standardized test in fact you know

what

bring out the monkey with you what is

wrong with you you made that little girl

cry think about what you've done no no

don't you don't you don't sit off you

can't think about what you've done

Oh shame on you

this one you have to ask yourself if

standardized tests are bad for teachers

and bad for kids who exactly are they

good for well it turns out they're

operated by companies like all these and

let's just focus on the largest one

Pearson as of 2012 they had nearly 40%

of the testing market almost triple

their nearest competitor and if you've

never heard of them then congratulations

but just mention their name to any

parent or teacher in a state they

operate in and you see what happens

because Pearson are the educational

equivalent of Time Warner Cable either

you've never had an interaction with

them and don't care or they have ruined

your life

Pearson have a shocking amount of

influence over America's schools so much

so that at this point a hypothetical

girl could take Pearson tests from

kindergarten through at least eighth

grade but a test by the way that she

studied for using Pierce and curriculum

and textbooks taught to her by teachers

who were certified by their own Pearson

test if at some point she was tested for

a learning disability like ADHD that's

also a Pearson test and if she

eventually got sick of Pearson and

dropped out well she'd have to take the

GED which is now guess what also a

Pearson test in fact the only test they

have no hand in is the HPV test you

might take in college I can only assume

that they'll get on that as soon as they

see this show Pearson has

enjoyed spectacular growth and profits

and yet their track record is littered

with complaints concerning technical

glitches slow grading and even the

contents of their tests take take what

happened in New York just a few years

ago almost 30 different test questions

have now been declared invalid because

they're confusing or have outright

errors they'd already pulled six

questions from an English exam related

to a bizarre passage about a talking

pineapple talking pineapple well at the

risk of sounding like a DreamWorks

executive talking to a CGI animator tell

me more about this talking pineapple

students had to answer questions about

the story which they say goes like this

a pineapple challenges a hair to erase

other animals figure the fruit has a

trick up its sleeve but the hair wins

and the animals eat the pineapple it

ends with the moral pineapples don't

have sleeves I was really confused

because I expected a lot more from them

that article about the pineapple in the

hair was stupid and absurd yeah she's

not wrong about that because we looked

up that test section and we couldn't

work out all the answers that pineapple

item doesn't remotely work as a test

question it barely works as a doors

lyric but it's it's not just Pearson's

questions that are a problem it's how

they check the answers the company

posted this ad to Craigslist it's to

find people to grade the exams

Craigslist they look for scorers on

Craigslist

Pearson chooses tests graders the same

way that you'd look for a mattress full

of bedbugs or a no-strings-attached hand

job and to be clear here just to be

clear this is not just a Pearson problem

across the whole testing industry you

can find former graders who will tell

you horror stories we looked at an essay

every two minutes a short answer every

five seconds every ten seconds we don't

understand your kids we don't understand

anyone's kids that is not an acceptable

answer from a person who may be

responsible for the future of your child

it's barely acceptable from the

manufacturers of American Girl dolls we

make dolls for a hundred bucks that kids

can't play with in case they get them

dirty we don't understand your kids we

don't understand anyone's kids as

another score points out sometimes great

are given out not based on merit but on

quota I was told when I was beginning a

project that last year you know there

were a certain amount of to a certain

amount of three is a certain amount of

force we expect that to be similar this

year if that's not similar they will

tell you we're scoring too many threes

we're scoring too many fours they'll say

you have to learn to see more papers as

a three you have to learn to see more

papers as a four that makes no sense if

the content of what you're looking at

has not changed that's not telling a

baseball umpire hey we've got a problem

with

averages you need to see more home runs

and strikeouts and more strikeouts as

doubles do it now

and I would love to show you more

questions from these tests but

unfortunately that's not only difficult

it's often illegal because both states

and companies have fought to keep test

questions secret for having teachers and

students signed statements like I will

not use or discuss the content of secure

test materials and while they'll say

that this is to protect against cheating

it does seem odd that even if you see

something wrong on a test you can't tell

anyone

standardized tests basically enforce the

rule that all subway riders

instinctively obey if you see something

keep it the to yourself we've all

seen someone vomit in a purse before

leave it

focus ahead and leave it bury it look

look we've had more than a decade of

standardized testing now and maybe it's

time to put the test to the test

the original goal was to narrow the

achievement gap and boost our scores

relative to the rest of the world

well a 2013 study found no support for

the idea that no child left behind an

hour at the achievement gap and our

scores on the international tests have

not only failed to rise they're slightly

down and I do not want to hear what that

French kid thinks of those results cause

this time and all this money and your

highs to the top has been how you say a

meandering jog on a treadmill

for a middle of what both presidents

asked for when selling their reforms

higher standards are the right goal

accountability is the right goal an

accountability system must have a

consequence otherwise it's not much of

an accountability system right so let's

look at that because as far as I can see

this is a system which has enriched

multiple companies and that pays and

fires teachers with a cattle birthing

formula confuses children with talking

pineapples and as the same kind of rules

regarding transparency that Brad Pitt

had for Fight Club so so for Pearson the

other companies and all the lawmakers

who have supported this system the true

test is going to be either convincing

everyone it works or accepting it

doesn't work and fixing it because at

the risk of sounding like a standardized

test score your numbers are not good and

if it seems unfair to have your fate

riding on a complicated metric that

fails to take institutional factors into

account and might not even tell the

whole story well you're not wrong about

that but you do not get to complain

about it and if all this pressure to

increase your numbers is making you feel

nauseous like you might vomit at any

second

and don't worry I've got four words for

you that'll make you feel better

here comes

sex education the conversation animals

in zoos refuse to let you not have now

with some kids going back to school next

week it is guaranteed that at some point

over the next school year you'll hear

stories like this local parents are

outraged tonight over the pictures that

their children saw in sex ed class some

parents say that the material which

includes descriptions of sex acts and

infections is simply too graphic for

middle schoolers a father is upset after

his 13 year old showed him a poster

hanging on a classroom door a poster

listing sex acts parental anger over sex

ed is as much a staple of the school

year as Square pizza

and one kid coming back from summer

vacation with a mustache he's way too

proud of that that's a ghost mustache

Luis it looks like the real mustache

died on your face so so we tried this

week to find out what sex ed looks like

in America right now but that turns out

to be a surprisingly difficult question

to answer now in the past depending on

how old you are sex education may have

been little more than watching films

like this every so often I get a strong

sex urge and the only way I can take

care of it is to masturbate Jorge I'm

really pleased that you can tell me

about this perhaps it's because we've

known each other for so long my name is

John extent for me it all started when I

went bowling with Judy today I shoulda

known something was different as soon as

she got a strike she's usually such a

rotten bowler so what's so different

about I got my first period today

it means that blood is flowing out of my

uterus okay okay okay first that is some

incredible misinformation menstrual

blood is not some sort of uterine HGH

that makes you amazing at bowling and

second and this is true the young man in

that video is Jonathan banks Mike from

Breaking Bad does not provide the basis

for the prequel to better core soul I'm

going to be extremely disappointed

teaching sex addict in schools is really

important for obvious reasons no parent

wants to talk to their kids about sex

and no kid wants to talk about sex with

their parents that is why when you're

watching a movie together and there's a

sex scene everyone becomes motionless

and silently begs for the merciful

release of death and kids have good

questions that need good answers The

Times recently ran an article with a

slideshow of questions kids wrote on on

cards to a sex educator including why is

the boy's penis shaped like an arrow is

it okay to be gay and how long do I have

to wait to have sex I'm excited to it to

which the answers are its engorged with

blood yes and can you at least wait

until the end of class but perhaps the

most poignant question was will this go

well for me because after looking into

sex ed programs this week the answer

depends quite a bit on where you live

there is no required standard for sex ed

in this country in fact only 22 states

mandate to the kids receive it and only

13 require that the information

presented be medically accurate which is

crazy you wouldn't accept a history

class not being historically accurate

Prince started the American Revolution

in 1994 and his Purple Reign lasts until

the present day class dismissed

what we essentially have a weird

patchwork system that varies wildly and

not just from state to state but from

district to district and even from

school to school in fact one oh hi oh

newscast

try to find out what kids in their area

were learning and hit a brick wall the

state has no absolutely none sex ed

guidelines so each school district

decides what's best for whatever kid

many school districts don't want to talk

about it at all you see students pulled

every school district in for Southwest

Ohio counties the majority wouldn't tell

us what they teach and when they teach

it even though all this is supposed to

be public information and that's really

not good because two teenagers shouldn't

have completely different levels of sex

ed just because they're in two different

school districts at tonight's football

game if it's when Lakewood High and

Middletown high not only are they bitter

rivals one of those teams has no idea

what a diaphragm is let's play ball

let's play ball but but while it is hard

to find out what kids are learning in

some cases it is possible to find out

what they are not learning for instance

in Mississippi while you can talk about

contraceptives the law prohibits condom

demonstrations in class that means no

condom on a banana no condom on a

cucumber no condom on a zucchini and

that's terrible partly because it's fun

putting condoms on produce but mainly

because Mississippi ranked number two in

the country in teen pregnancy rates now

thankfully this situation has inspired

some creative alternatives what this

former teacher described how to use a

condom without directly using a condom

because I want to make sure that there's

room for my toes when I'm engaging in

Shu activity take your stock and you

want to roll it all the way down it's

not perfect no if you can't get a sock

out of the packaging you don't then lose

your foot for a minutes and need to

think of Rihanna to get it back but its

back but but Mississippi's restrictions

are just the beginning here in eight

states there are laws considerably

limiting what teachers can say about

homosexuality to their students

meaning the answer to that kid's

question is it okay to be gay could be a

shrug or a lot worse and Utah's law

prohibits any instruction in the

intricacies of intercourse for reasons

that one state legislator explained

those are the things we do not want to

be taught in our schools those are

things that should be taught in your

home what taught in your home here is an

exchange that has never happened how are

you so good at sex I was home-schooled

and it's in certain districts around the

country the only sex ed you might

receive is abstinence only which you may

think of as a relic of the past but it

is still very much around Congress

recently increased federal funding for

abstinence only education from the from

about fifty to seventy-five million

dollars per year and at least part of

that money gets matched by the states

which means that students are still

being exposed to abstinence centered

programs but we've names like wait which

stands for why am i tempted go ape or

abstinence protects everyone and no

screwing around which I presume stands

for no one should copy like regularly

except when did individuals and now

reach around occasionally ultimately not

disastrous

and here's here's a taste of a video

from that last program if you have sex

outside of one permanent monogamous and

monogamy does not mean one at a time

that means one partner who has only been

with you you have sex outside of that

context and you will pay boys if there's

a girl throwing herself at you if she's

the one pressuring you for sex if this

is a girl that's dressing in that manner

that's saying not only of you but the

rest of the world take me now I got a

little word of advice for you run from

the screw run I did not say what go away

slowly

I said run from her in fact uh don't

even bother running boys just cut your

dicks off girls are snake charmers and

it's time to murder your snakes murder

them now do it do it

and what abstinence is a healthy choice

that many teams will make either by

choice or as I can attest by

circumstance

only thing you teach and not just

because many studies question its

efficacy the fact is according to the

CDC most Americans have more than one

sexual partner in their lifetime and the

average age at which people begin having

sex is around 17 so just saying don't do

it is not practical and even when they

do teach sex ed schools can teach it

with a strong bias we found a company

which offers schools two versions of the

same video on contraception version B is

labeled as being non-judgmental take a

look look no one ever said being a

teenager is easy you have to face a lot

of important decisions but no decision

is probably more important than the one

you'll make about becoming sexually

active some of you may already be

sexually active but still a lot of you

are not having sex yet you could be

waiting for marriage the right person or

maybe you're just not ready to take on

this very serious responsibility right

now cool oops

thumbs up those 30 year old actors

dressed like teenager from the 90s make

some very good points however however

version a which is non non-judgmental

goes in a slightly different direction

see if you can spot it look no one ever

said being a teenager is easy you have

to face a lot of important decisions but

no decision is probably more important

than the one you'll make about becoming

sexually active as a teenager you're

expected to wait until you're married

before you become sexually active until

then

abstinence is the only option that's

acceptable to your family your school

and your community well hold on then why

do they even keep the first part about

it being a decision at all they should

have just said no decision is more

non-existent than the one you don't get

to make about sex

also remember God is watching you

masturbate and the fluids coming out of

your genitals are actually his tears you

may

who's sad but they're very fact two

videos with the same title but very

different messages exist shows just how

hard it can be to find out what's going

on with sex ed where you live and this

is not even accounting for guest

speakers that schools can bring in to

augment their program remember the woman

from no screwing around that's Pam

stencil and her website claims she

speaks to half a million young people

each year presumably like this here's

the line over which you can't step

absolutely no genital contact of any

kind

that's hand to genital mouth to genital

genital to genital oral sex which is

mouth to genital is sex and if you have

ever stepped over this line you've

risked disease and you need to get

tested and don't you dare don't you dare

tell anyone you're a virgin why why are

you trying to yell the horniness out of

teenagers throw programs like hers are

so relentlessly anti sex you could

easily come away thinking the adult

world is just an endless barrage of

unwanted dicks which incidentally was

the original slogan for tinder

stanzin is not alone Shelley Donohue

currently speaks at schools around the

country she likes to show the dangers of

more than one sexual partner by

describing women as a piece of tape and

then sticking the tape to the arms of

multiple boys until this happens how

many partners do we have before we get

married on average in America yeah so

can you imagine what's gonna start to

happen to the tape it's gonna lose its

bonding power her point is the tape is

used so much it becomes damaged which

doesn't even consider the possibility

that the tape might be perfectly happy

and have had a good time or that maybe

some guys like take that already knows

how to stick when they meet them but but

this idea that sex is something which

devalues those who've had it

particularly women crops up again and

again non virgins can be likened to a

used toothbrush or a chewed up piece of

gum and then there is this video in

which a non virgin on her wedding night

is compared to a dirty shoe my sneakers

business it looks like the entire

football team has been in these things I

made them all wear socks socks but shell

socks don't protect my heart you can

still get foot fungus with sauce I wish

I could go back in time and make a

commitment to be abstinent until

marriage that is heartbreaking and not

just because he's shaming his wife but

because Michelle socks don't protect my

heart might be the funniest line ever

delivered on this show and we didn't

write it

and that that kind of message can be

hugely damaging to anyone who hears it

especially survivors of sexual assault

like Elizabeth Smart who was kidnapped

and assaulted at the age of 14 and you

may recognize one of the metaphors she

remembers one of her teachers using she

said imagine you're a stick of gum and

when you engage in sex that's like

that's like getting chew and then if you

do that lots of times it's gonna become

an old piece of gum and who's going to

want to rock through that

well that terrible but nobody should

ever say that but for me I thought oh my

gosh I'm not chewed up piece of gum

learning nothing would have been better

than learning that it's not a great

reflection on her teacher that kids who

were sick that day got a better

education than she did and the sad thing

is sex ed when done well can do so much

good but when it's done badly it can do

real harm take consent a recent survey

found college students were confused

about certain aspects of it for instance

when asked whether another person

undressing getting a condom or nodding

established consent for more sexual

activity at least 40 percent said yes

and at least 40 percent said no and that

ambiguity is a problem because sex is

like boxing if both people didn't fully

agree to participate one of them is

committing a crime and abstinence heavy

messages do not help this they spend so

much time on the importance of saying no

they can leave out what informed

enthusiastic consent looks like or even

worse suggests that it's all one party's

responsibility like in this video from a

program called sex smart about fending

off unwanted advances maybe we should

have sex you know to prove our love for

each other do you really think we're

ready yeah oops that didn't work each

other

no does that mean no yes

one more try this time say it like you

mean it

each other no way finally maybe we

should just get to the concert wait what

they were already late for a concert but

he felt there was still time to have sex

that is a teenage boy with a very

accurate sense of his abilities but much

much much more to the point it's good

that that girl was being taught that she

has the power to say no but nowhere in

the video do they point out that that

guy should have been a lot better at

hearing it and it is weird to gloss over

something so appalling it's like that

moment in Greece when Kenickie sang tell

me more tell me more did she put up a

fight that's the point they should have

stopped the whole song and gone wait

what what the did you just say what is

wrong with you Kenickie what is what

you're a monster and you look 40 and

when kids graduate high school without a

full understanding of consent

you are abetting an already troubling

culture where a bunch of frat guys can

march around Yale feeling completely

comfortable yelling out this just a

quick reminder there Yale's acceptance

rate is six point three percent so who

the are they turning down I would

hate to hear their chants and the

problem is that is not an isolated

incident last year fraternities at both

Texas Tech and LSU will caught using the

same slogan it's become something you

hear on college campuses as often as I'm

thinking of switching majors or why is

James Franco here

here is the thing there is no way we'd

allow any other academic program to

consistently fail to prepare students

for life after school and human

sexuality

unlike calculus is something you

actually need to know about for the rest

of your life

and maybe you and your family live

somewhere that has good sex ed in which

case congratulations but if you don't

this video is for you look no one ever

said being a teenager is D did you have

to face a lot of important decisions but

no decision is probably more important

than the one you'll make about becoming

sexually active and if you do there's a

few things you should definitely know

this is a penis this is a vagina this is

a head and this is a but you can mix as

many of these as you feel comfortable in

hand and mouth would be you could this

is the clitoris and these are the

testicles they make sperm that's pretty

much it if you want to be abstinent

that's fine if you don't want to be

absent

that's also fine abstinence is like

being a vegetarian people should respect

your choice

some people might make fun of you those

people are assholes safeguard against

STDs is protection unless you already

have an STD in which case you're gonna

need medicine or some fun fact the

ancient Egyptians put crocodile dung

mixed with honey inside a vagina to

prevent pregnancy they're all dead now

here's how you put a condom on a banana

oh this is a lot less curvy than I'm

used to

this is an IUD an IUD goes inside a

woman's body and prevents pregnancy from

taking place

they can stay inside you for up to ten

years which is a lot considering most

guys in high school can only stay inside

you for a minute or two to up here's a

bunch of other forms of birth control

this is actually simple if someone

doesn't want to have sex with you don't

have sex with them

if you think you might be able to

persuade someone to have sex even though

they don't want to don't so if you're

not sure if someone wants to have sex

with you ask even if you're kind of sure

if someone is pretty drunk they might

not be able to give consent and remember

you can always say no even if someone

wants you to do a sex thing you're not

comfortable with you have the right to

refuse say I don't care if it's a birth

defect I don't want you to put your

finger in my butt okay real quick couple

funny things most people will get HPV is

both technically true and what you tend

to hear right before someone gives you

HPV if you call it a hoo-ha you are not

ready for sex food is your friend

believe me if you get a chance to have

sex with this man

go for it this safe word is Putin Annie

a woman who's had sex is not like a

and finally in this isn't for you anyone

ever tells you that getting your period

makes you better at both

[Applause]

criminal justice the process by which

you are arrested charged and eventually

go before a jury who render their

verdict we find the defendant Robert

Brooks not guilty we find Randall Bailey

guilty we find the defendant not guilty

have you reached the wording guilty or

not guilty

that is just objectively charming

although all these years later I still

can't believe those penguins wrongfully

convicted the Central Park five now

whenever whenever we talk whenever we

talk about criminal justice reform we

tend to just talk about policing public

defenders judges and prisons and skip

over a crucial element there prosecutors

the attorneys who work for the federal

state and local government and bring

cases to trial there are roughly 2,500

DA's offices all around the country and

they have a surprising amount of

influence at almost every single stage

of the criminal justice system because

prosecutors decide whether you get

charged and what you get charged with

and therefore heavily influenced what

kind of sentence you could face and you

you sort of know deep down how important

they are because of a little phrase that

crops up constantly

in local news crime stories ultimately

it'll be prosecutors who decide whether

charges will be filed prosecutors will

decide whether to file criminal charges

prosecutors will decide what happens

next prosecutors will decide exactly

prosecutors will decide it's one of

those three word phrases that you hear

so often you don't even think about what

it means anymore like User Agreement

update or some restrictions apply or

Tyler Perry presents you know at this

point I'm just going to assume that he

presents everything it's safer that way

I technically think he presents this

show I wouldn't be completely surprised

about that

I look we tend not to think about that

power very much except when there is a

high-profile controversy concerning

prosecutors failure to exercise it as

has happened in numerous police

shootings of unarmed black men or when

Manhattan da saw Vance declined to

prosecute Harvey Weinstein in 2015

citing insufficient evidence despite

police officials insisting that they had

plenty of evidence including Exhibit A

his face but but it but it is worth

talking about what happens when

prosecutors do decide to exercise that

power because while many try to do their

jobs honorably that power can be misused

or amplified the inequities inherent in

the system and let's start with a truly

incredible fact here the vast majority

of the time your fate is not decided by

a judge or a jury of your peers because

nearly 95 percent of the cases

prosecutors decide to bring end up with

the defendant pleading guilty now what

that means is no trial no innocent until

proven guilty just a prosecutor striking

a deal behind closed doors and many

judges are resigned to that fact because

at least plea bargains keep the system

moving the system would collapse if

every case that was filed in the

criminal justice system were to be set

for trial the system would just entirely

collapse exactly it's an inadequate

system that only functions if people

constantly give up it's built on the

exact same model as AT&T x' customer

service hotline that's right AT&T new

owners of HBO longtime owners of an

unforgivably dog customer service

hotline

if somebody pleads guilty they they must

have done it that's not necessarily the

case in Houston testing of samples in

drug cases have exonerated 133 people

since 2014 and those people had pled

guilty in every single case which is

messed up the only people who should be

claiming to have used drugs when they

happen to awkward teenagers at high

school parties oh I'm totally a wieder

I'm into all the weeds I'm stoning right

now that's how potted I am so so why do

innocent people plead guilty what

prosecutors will often offer a deal

while threatening that if you go to

trial they will stack charges against

you and pursue a much harsher sentence

it's something commonly referred to as a

trial penalty just listen to Rodney

Roberts he was accused of a sexual

assault the DNA evidence later proved he

did not commit and I'll let him explain

what he took a deal when I finally got

to the court this attorney he came in

and told me that the prosecutor office

had a plea agreement from it and like

plea agreement even do it you know I

pled not guilty I'm innocent

he was like this urgent he was this

pressure and he was like if you don't

take this deal the only offer your two

years you're home in two years and if

not you know they're gonna take it off

to trial and a judge is ready to give

you a life sentence if you get found

guilty and I think you're gonna get

found guilty and this is my attorney

telling me it's the one person I had to

dead out me so I thought that to get

home to my son

they're my family and established in my

life that the best thing I could do for

myself was to plead guilty and fight it

once I got home and as crazy as it

sounds to hear that it kind of makes

sense two years in prison is terrible

but a life sentence is absolutely

terrifying the only way that makes sense

were defendant to risk that is if

they're a gerbil because two years in

life are basically the same thing to

those litters

but but but let's say you are one of the

five percent of people who risk going to

trial prosecutors still have lots of

ways to try and gain an advantage for

instance prosecutors are not allowed to

discriminate by race during jury

selection and if it's suspected that

they are the Supreme Court has said that

they could be required to provide race

neutral explanations for striking tours

which sounds like a good rule but it has

been laughably easy for them to get

around because judges will accept just

about any reason in Texas a training

document for prosecutors even

conveniently listed examples of

race-neutral reasons that judges had

accepted including having a 1970s hairdo

being a very pretty girl who might be

attracted to the defendant or the

defense counsel wearing a Malcolm X hat

agreeing with the OJ Simpson verdict

being a male wearing earrings in both

ears and my personal favorites for

wearing a bad boys club jacket pink hat

and snakeskin belts which is just

insulting because that look does not

make you untrustworthy it makes you

awesome I like the way I look at

guarantee perhaps the area where

prosecutors can exert the most influence

concerns evidence because they control

the case files things like police

reports witness information and physical

evidence and while they are required to

hand over anything that is exculpatory

or that might be useful in your defense

in some states including New York they

can do that at the very last minute

something incredible happens on the day

of trial certainly a case file that for

a year was this thick suddenly now

becomes this thick and so in our most

serious cases in the cases where we have

climbed to are looking at incredible

amounts of potential jail time even life

in jail this is what we are given when

DA's answer ready for trial and the

reality is is that in Manhattan too

often it is trial by ambush it's true

and they can then have to argue a case

without having read all the important

material it's basically a much higher

stakes version of a kid giving a

presentation in English class without

having read the book in conclusion

whether Heights the heights are watering

but by the end the heights rather much

more than they weathered at the

beginning of the book thank you for your

time just a quick but important message

for English teachers no one has ever

read a single book you have ever

assigned it has never happened not once

and look sometimes defense attorneys may

not be given exculpatory evidence at all

in fact among exoneration cases around

1/4 of them involve prosecutors

concealing its culprit ory evidence and

that is because prosecutors typically

get to decide whether something is

relevant to the defense which seems

inherently flawed

you can't just count on an adversary to

voluntarily expose all of their

weaknesses in Star Wars the rebels had

to steal the Death Star plans the Empire

didn't just email it to them with a

subject line for word gigantic stupid

weak spot parentheses very dumb go to

town and when prosecutors do withhold

evidence there is very little

accountability for them take Michael

Morton like in 1987 he was wrongfully

convicted of his wife's murder after the

prosecutor in that case withheld crucial

pieces of exculpatory evidence now the

good news is that prosecutor Ken

Anderson was held to account for that

misconduct the bad news is there was a

slight discrepancy between the two men's

sentences Morton served nearly 25 years

in prison

8900 95 days and now the sentence for

the prosecutor just 10 days in jail for

contempt of court 10 days and he served

less than half that although before you

get too mad he did also have to pay a

$500 fine which which isn't really the

penalty you'd expect for wiping out 25

years of someone's life it's close to

what you'd expect for a

cantaloupe at Whole Foods 10 days for

the public indecency $500 for the

cantaloupe

and to make it to make it even worse

Anderson is actually the only prosecutor

to ever serve any time for misconduct

resulting in a wrongful conviction ever

because the truth is prosecutors rarely

face any sort of consequences for

misconduct state bars are supposed to

hold them accountable but a study of

five states found that in 660 cases

where courts had confirmed prosecutorial

misconduct the number of prosecutors

disciplined in those cases was one and

that lack of accountability can fuel a

dangerous culture where winds are

already prioritized to a disturbing

degree in fact in one DA's office in

Colorado

prosecutors were paid bonuses for

achieving a high conviction rate and in

Texas a DA rewarded convictions in

misdemeanor cases with a prize that they

called the trial dog award and let me

just say as the proud proud owner of

nine trial dogs my award goes to this

one please don't die please please don't

die I can't how important it is for you

to hang in there and and and there was

there was the notoriously aggressive

office also of New Orleans DA Harry

Connick senior who is yes Harry Connick

Jr's dad in fact here they are on Harry

jr. short-lived talk show singing a

weirdly inappropriate Joette just well

the

[Music]

[Applause]

Harry's wild about me the heavenly

places of his kisses

yeah now if you didn't see any problem

with that he's just a fun experiment for

you to try at home call your own father

right now

tell him that the heavenly bliss is of

his kisses fill you with ecstasy and

just see how that goes my prediction is

your next fishing trip is going to be

extra quiet but during his time as New

Orleans da lots of people were wild

about Harry Connick senior because his

office was famously ruthless Harry

Connick was tough on crime he was very

aggressive and he wanted to block him

all up forever conics lead prosecutor

was Jim Williams Jim took great pride in

his numerous death penalty convictions

he even kept a miniature electric chair

on his desk Jim was regarded as one of

the most aggressive prosecutors in the

District Attorney's Office he described

sliding up behind defendants in the

courtroom and buzzing in their ears to

mimic the the buzz of electricity holy

that is just not okay although

there was also literally no scenario in

which sliding up behind someone in

saying buzz in their ear is acceptable

not even if you are Neil Armstrong on

the moon and you need to get Buzz

Aldrin's attention hey buzz buzz buzz

buzz we're on the moon buzz buzz buzz

buzz are you mad I was first buzz buzz

but but that office is win at all costs

culture resulted in some serious

mistakes as it turns out fully a quarter

of the men sentenced to death during

conics tenure had their convictions

overturned because of improperly

withheld evidence and remember that

little electric chair when the

prosecutors had on his desk here's a fun

fact in the photo of Jim Williams with

the electric chair of the five faces

visible all of them were released from

death row yep

the thing he kept as a token of his

success is now a monument to poor

decision-making it is the prosecutorial

equivalent of Cuba Gooding jr. zaask er

and look if you want to see why did that

joke upset you more than anything else

tonight you have got to be consistent

you've got to be you might care about

Cuba you care about him too much in this

context and look if you want to see all

the problems that I've described tonight

in action just take a look at the case

of Glen Ford who was on death row for 30

years after being wrongfully convicted

now the prosecutor on his case Marty

Stroud says that he got caught up in an

aggressive hard-charging culture and

admits to among other things

deliberately excluding African American

jurors and overlooking evidence that

would have cleared Glen Ford and what

happened clearly still haunts him I

ended up without anybody else's help

putting a man on death row who didn't

belong there I mean at the end of the

day beginning in middle whatever you

want to call it I did something that was

very very bad yeah it was it was very

very very bad in fact the problem is

that while he is clearly remorseful in

terms of accountability there were no

professional sanctions for his actions

in fact the acting da after Ford was

released Dale Cox doesn't even believe

that Stroud should have apologized did

mr. Ford get justice in this case I

think he has

gotten delayed justice the system did

not fail mr. Ford it did not it did not

in fact the system you see that because

he's not on death row and that's how I

can say it getting out of prison after

30 years is justice well it's better

than dying there and it's better than

being executed yeah I guess that's true

but listen to how low he's setting the

bar they're better than being executed

or dying in prison by that measure

anything succeeds Taco Bell

better than being executed or dying in

prison although when you think about it

is it is it definitely between 2010 and

2014 that man's office was responsible

for sending more prisoners to death row

than anywhere else in the country and if

you think the Glen Ford debacle may have

made him more cautious you would be

wrong I think society should be

employing the death penalty more rather

than less but there have been ten other

inmates on death row in Louisiana who

have been exonerated clearly the system

is not flawless

are you sure that you've gotten a right

all the time I'm reasonably confident

that that I've gotten it right

oh you're reasonably confident are you

that does not seem like it should be the

standard to send someone to death row I

was reasonably confident I could pull

off bangs I was wrong about that

and if someone's life depended on it I

might have given it a little more

thought and look at this point you may

well be wondering how can we fix some of

what we've seen tonight well clearly

permanent legislative fixes are badly

needed from requiring greater

transparency from prosecutors about

sharing evidence through so-called

open file laws to ideally establishing

independent commissions to investigate

misconduct but depending on where you

live there may actually be a more direct

way for you to effect change because

DA's are usually elected it's something

you might sometimes forget until you see

aggressive campaign attack ads like this

one which ends in a bizarre turn of

phrase this is how many child molesters

the Calcasieu Parish do

he has prosecuted as lead counsel

how many murders how many rapes Roberts

meanwhile our sheriff reports crime is

on the rise and Calcasieu Parish Steve

Street for District Attorney

he'll try harder and a lot more but he

would try a harder and a lot more often

that's a pretty weak promise Steve the

was your opponent's Logan Nathan

Hamilton justice on Mondays and

Wednesdays unless something comes up

well it seems like it's gonna be a whole

thing look the facts prosecutors are

elected means that you can change them

the problem is around 85% of prosecutors

actually run unopposed in both primary

and general elections it's gotten so bad

that in one County in Washington state

their prosecutor had run for ten terms

without any opposition so four years ago

in frustration someone ran ran their dog

against him I know I know what you're

thinking I'll great another white dog

prosecutor and I'm not saying you're

wrong but let's go one step at a time

here look clearly we need more

reform-minded DA's to run because thanks

to the extreme breadth of power they

have that could actually be a backdoor

way to effect change on a whole host of

issues from fail to the misuse of

forensic science to the enforcement of

marijuana laws and maybe you are one of

the lucky ones here maybe your local DA

is great

or maybe they're a win obsessed asshole

whose heavenly Bliss's of their kisses

fill their adults songs with ecstasy or

maybe a live in Washington State over

the past four years your district

attorney has been this dog and

you didn't even realize it because can

you honestly say with a hundred percent

certainty that your district attorney is

not a dog you probably can't and that's

kind of the problem here most people

know as much about their local DA as

they know about their local Cheesecake

Factory manager chances are you don't

know who they are and if you do it's

probably because something truly

terrible has happened

but the truth is like the Cheesecake

Factory

prosecutors have the ability to ruin

lives in a second so so we need to find

out who our DA's are and get a sense of

the policies and priorities that they're

carrying out where we live because if we

do not decide ourselves what we want the

criminal justice system to look like

deep down you know who will exactly they

will

vaccines or as the fun doctor and your

family practice books it shot-shot

shot-shot shot-shot shot-shot church

seriously there'll be a slight pinch

now vaccines are one of humanity's most

incredible accomplishments and they've

saved millions of lives and there was a

time when a new one was a cause for huge

celebration dr. Jonas Salk discovers a

vaccine that promises to wipe out

childhoods crippling and killing enemy

polio anxious parents are thrilled and

grateful responding to one of the

greatest mass inoculations and medical

annals it's true people lined up for the

polio shot like it was an iPhone

although although for the record polio

was never childhoods most crippling

enemy because that was and will forever

remain accidentally seeing your father's

penis

but suffice it by their success small

groups are both skeptical and vocal

about vaccines which is nothing new but

these days their voice has been

amplified by the human megaphone that is

the President of the United States I am

totally in favor of vaccines but I want

smaller doses over a longer period of

time because you take a baby in and I've

seen it and I've seen it and I had my

children taking care of over a long

period of time over two or three year

period of time same exact amount but you

take this little beautiful baby and you

pump I mean it looks just like it's

meant for a horse not for a child that

is totaled from on the campaign trail

raising doubts about vaccinations and

that is a sentiment that he's also

expressed online with a tweet reading

tiny children are not horses and that

that is an assertion that PolitiFact

rates yeah I mean I guess technically

we've got to give him that but you agree

and look look you know this you know

this it is not wise to take health care

advice from man who has willingly sought

care from this doctor who looks like he

sneaks into a sin you're frogs in the

middle of the night to Fox the boxer

elastics you let you know that but but

it is not just Trump who is skeptical

and those concerns have driven some

people to extremes for instance back in

2011 some parents made headlines by

taking what they saw are they more

natural route to immunizing their

children Catherine were talking about

parents who are taking use the lollipops

saliva and puss soaked clothing from

complete strangers and deliberately

infecting their children okay okay all

right so setting aside the grossest of

parents infecting their kids with

lollipops from strangers that graphic

has an unfortunate misspelling because

swapping spit and passing pulse

sounds like the TED talk that Kid Rock

would give you a teenage shot

what's wrong I know you're going to want

to swap some straight past the hood but

if you don't throw a raincoat on that

devil dog it's going to be stored silly

for you buckaroo this was quality time

we just had some quality time and while

it is important to remember that the

vast majority of parents are making sure

that their children get vaccinated on

time the voices of those who don't carry

any internet search about vaccines will

quickly lead you down a frightening

rabbit hole and the background hum of

doubt can make some parents

understandably nervous I'm concerned

about how many vaccines you need

remember we have to give our children at

once some kind of debating whether I

will do them but I'm debating the age

when should I have them done there's

just so much information there I don't I

don't know who to ask I don't know if

there's you know there's no such thing

as an unbiased source at least 10

percent of parents delay or skip some

shots around 1 percent don't vaccinate

at all right you know parents get so

much information it is hard to know what

to do should you vaccinate should you

eat the placenta should you let kids cry

and the answer to those by the way are

yes no and absolutely because the more

they try now the more they'll be

prepared to watch this is us when they

get older

[Applause]

and this this atmosphere of confusion

about vaccines has caused real problems

there are now 11 states where the number

of unvaccinated kids is on the rise and

in small pockets all over America the

numbers can get startlingly high in the

Somali community in Minnesota the

measles vaccination rate for children

dropped to just 42 percent and that had

some very real consequences measles once

eradicated in the u.s. is now exploding

in Minnesota Somali community where many

parents won't vaccinate the virus is so

contagious that if you're exposed to it

and you don't have the vaccine there's a

90% chance you'll contract it they can

have permanent brain damage they can

have blindness or deafness and so we

wouldn't vaccinate if this was just a

Raschi illness this is a very serious

disease exactly and this is how bad it

is in that community the number of

measles cases so far this year has

already outpaced the total number in all

the US last year and that is terrible

because the only thing Minnesota should

have more of than any other state is

Garrison Keillor and people disappointed

by the Mall of America

oh so it's just a bigger mall and it has

to build-a-bear workshops that's amazing

this memory will last me a lifetime

as will these two bears for two

different build-a-bear workshop so

tonight we are going to look at why

these beers persist and what the

consequences of succumbing to them can

be and before we start I kind of get why

vaccines can creep people out

vaccinations can mean getting injected

by a needle filled with science juice

although pretty much every medical

practice sounds terrifying when you

break it down like that an appendectomy

means removing one of your organs

through stabber II antibiotics are

poisons used to murder things living in

you and even exercise means forcefully

burning up your inside

my point is the human body is a true

Carnival of Horrors and frankly I'm

embarrassed to have one

and what much of the fear surrounding

vaccines stems from their supposedly to

autism now that is a theory that gained

traction in the late 90s thanks to a

study published in the medical journal

The Lancet suggesting a link between

autism and the MMR vaccine the study was

of just 12 children and it was by this

guy Andrew Wakefield and if you're

wondering why I didn't say dr. Andrew

Wakefield this is why follow-up studies

of hundreds of thousands of children

could not find any evidence that the MMR

vaccine causes autism and investigations

into Wakefield's original paper revealed

he distorted the data and acted

unethically

he's lost his medical license The Lancet

paper has been retracted

it's true Wakefield's made a big splash

before having his legacy tarnished and

his title revoked he's basically the

Lance Armstrong of doctors but but but

even though Wakefield conclusions have

been debunked many times he not only

denies wrongdoing he actually still

gives talks about the supposed dangers

of the MMR vaccine in fact this is him

in 2011 talking to the Somali community

that we saw earlier in Minnesota and

presumably ending his speech with trust

me I'm a used to be a doctor and to be

fair Wakefield is not the only voice

raising alarms about vaccines he has

company from across the political

spectrum from a Robert F Kennedy jr. on

the left to Alex Jones wherever the

he fits in to even this guy he can't

make you can't make people do procedure

that they don't want the parents have to

be the ones to make the decisions for

what's best for Mike for our kids it

can't be the government saying that it's

against the nuremberg laws yes that is

Rob Schneider performing an impromptu

rendition of his famous character the

annoying guy who is wrong because

because despite his misunderstanding of

among other things what the Nuremberg

Laws are and what constitutes acceptable

headwear for a grown man Snyder has

spoken out against mandatory vaccines

for years even once calling this

California state Assemblywoman to debate

the issue prompting her to post on

Facebook

be honest that is 20 minutes of my life

I'll never get back

arguing that vaccines don't cause autism

with deuce Bigalow male gigolo yeah sure

so it's funny it's funny but so hold on

lady let's not Sully the good name of

deuce Bigalow just because of something

that his portrayal Rob Schneider said

that's like implying William Wallace

doesn't trust Jews or officer Nordberg

is a murderer so no time separate the

two now now the good news is these days

very few people will say they are

completely anti-vaccine instead like the

president they'll say I'm not anti

vaccine but and it's what comes after

that but that we need to look at tonight

because one example is hey I'm not anti

vaccine but I am Pro safe vaccine and

and that can often refer to concern over

scary sounding ingredients like

thimerosal a mercury-based preservative

for years now RFK jr. has led a crusade

against it in fact just this year he

gave a speech where he said this for 33

years I've been working to get mercury

at fish nobody has ever called me any

fish and because I want mercury out of

vaccines I should not be called any

vaccine okay well for a start what would

anyone be ashamed to be called anti fish

fish are stupid and how do I know that

look at them just look at this idiot and

it's not just him check this moron out

as well and while you're at it what

about this dimwit here's another

bonehead for you I'm pretty sure this

dunks didn't make it past the third

grade

and I think we can all agree that this

doofus isn't exactly curing cancer oh

that's right

come at me fish oh I'm sorry you can't

kanya because because and that's because

after 500 million years you still

haven't figured out how to breathe air

you fish it's easy

I'm doing it now

even you don't know me fish get out of

here

you know what more importantly in

fact much more importantly it is worth

knowing that the mercury that has been

used in vaccines is not the same kind

that is harmful in fish on top of which

as with the MMR vaccine there have been

multiple large studies finding no link

between thimerosal and autism and

perhaps most importantly at all since

the early 2000s as a precautionary

measure it has been removed as a

preservative from all vaccines

recommended for infants except for the

flu vaccines and even there thimerosal

three versions are available so we

essentially spent time and energy

solving a problem that never existed

it's like spending years fighting to get

marshmallows out of Lucky Charms because

a few people think minions can choke to

death on them force our marshmallows

dissolve and minions don't exist and if

they did I would want them to choke to

death because those little will

murder us open your eyes and look if

you're thinking well hold on hold on if

it wasn't harmful why was it taken out

well there was intense public concern

that was amplified by people like then

congressman Dan Burton making arguments

like this I have not yet to find any

scientist who will say that there's no

doubt no doubt that the mercury in

vaccines does not contribute to autism

now they'll say there's no scientific

evidence there's no studies or anything

that proves that yet but turn that

around there are no studies that

disprove it either all right all right

okay

proving a negative is an impossible

standard and that is also a slippery

slope because it means that I can say to

you you Dan Burton are a donkey

you dress up donkeys in cheerleader

outfits and you thought them if what

you're into and you do it all

and you are saying to me for weight

there is absolutely no evidence of me

doing that but I would say turn that

around there's no evidence of you not

doing that either please and this is not

a road that you want to go down and the

thing is the thing is that donkey

is remarks actually get at why

scientists can be at a real disadvantage

in this debate because they by their

nature are careful in how they present

their conclusions science and English

are not really the same language and so

when a scientist says we have no

evidence that there's a link between

vaccines and autism what they're really

saying is you know we are as positive as

someone can humanly be that there's no

link and one thing that I sometimes do

when I'm talking to parents is say I'm

as confident that there's no link

between vaccines and autism as I am that

if I was going to walk off this building

that I would not be able to fly right

and that is about as clear as you can be

and for the record if your doctor does

believe they can fly run because they

are either crazy or they are are Kelly

and if your if your pediatrician is are

Kelly that things are actually the least

of your problem and I know I know that

some will say that the real problem is

that scientists have been paid by pharma

companies to hide the problems with

vaccines you can find countless memes

online about how the whole system is

corrupt some of which feature a very

smart looking cat and and I'm not saying

that there are not problems with Big

Pharma there absolutely are we have

discussed them before on this show but

on the rare occasions where there have

been issues with vaccines they have been

pulled and fast and I know that that

explanation will still not satisfy some

there are going to be some truly toxic

comments below this video

alongside the usual ones about how I

look like an owl who can't get a date

for prom

Oh or that I probably live alone

surrounded by jars I'm too weak to open

by myself and I think you're laughing

too hard at that and those comments will

link to the hidden truths about vaccines

and demand to know why I didn't look

into them and you know what we did look

into a lot of them and the problem is I

can go point by point by point and be

talking for hours tonight and this will

still never end it's like whack-a-mole

as one theory goes down another pops up

and I kind of get the insistence that

there must be a link at the age children

are supposed to get the MMR vaccine

happens to be the same age that

diagnosable signs of autism can begin to

appear but correlation is not causation

that is what scientific studies are for

and remember they are really clear that

link is not there and the problem with

spending more and more time and money

trying to prove that link is that it

takes resources away from studying

actual causes and treatments just listen

to the mother of one child with autism

who started a foundation precisely

because she wanted to find out the

causes we have dozens of studies I think

we were right to look at whether

vaccines might be a cause of autism but

there comes a point where there is so

much evidence none of which shows any

link between vaccines and autism that

you have to say enough yeah that's right

it's like that Einstein quotes is

sometimes see on the Internet the

definition of insanity is doing the same

thing over and over again and expecting

different results

except Einstein didn't say that because

and it seems I cannot stress this enough

means aren't fact and if you won't take

that from me take it from this very

smart looking cat

but again that that hyung of doubt it's

hard to shake off and some parents agree

with the president and they favor

hedging their bets and skipping or

spacing vaccines out just in case

93% of pediatricians say they've been

asked by parents to do just that and one

of the places that that idea may be

coming from is a pediatrician named dr.

Sears not bill sees the famous doctor

and author but his son Bob Sears dr. Bob

has made a name for himself with what

can seem like a sensible sounding

approach to address wide parents

concerns what I've put together is what

I call my alternative vaccine schedule

it's a way to get a baby fully

vaccinated that in a manner that spreads

the shots out a little bit and that

sounds like a decent compromise because

it's the middle ground position right

the problem is is the middle ground

between sense and nonsense

it's like saying it would be crazy to

eat that entire bar of soap

so I'll just eat half of it now the

enthusiasm for spacing vaccines out

stems from some parents belief that

children these days get too many shots

too soon perhaps best summed up by this

meme of a dog full of needles and I will

say if that's how they were given I

would oppose that but let's break that

fear down because while it is true that

children do receive more shots than they

used to the number of antigens in those

shots or the substances that induce the

immune response has greatly decreased

and it's a drop in the ocean compared to

the thousands of foreign antigens our

child usually encounters every day just

watch a child for five minutes and see

if they don't eat their friend's boogers

put their entire mouth over the water

Balcon or try and kiss a raccoon they

just found in a dumpster while playing

hide and seek my point is children are

disgusting

I even see it himself as of may be that

his approach is not based on scientific

research so where is that where is the

published peer-reviewed evidence to

support the notion of a quote overload

if you follow the CDC recommended

schedule where where does that exist

Chris I don't think there is any such

research and I actually never claimed

there was I certainly have put out there

very clearly in my writings that my

precautions on spreading out vaccines

are theoretical it's a theoretical

benefit to kids and it's a choice that I

think a lot of parents feel more

comfortable about and might actually

bring more parents to vaccinate if they

can spread the shots out more than the

regular schedule right except your job

is to make sure children don't get

deadly diseases not to make parents

comfortable because you're a

pediatrician not a flask of whiskey

tucked into a BabyBjorn dr. Bob

sometimes seems to be trying to have it

both ways because while he says he is

pro-vaccine and that he doesn't

explicitly tell parents to skip or delay

important shots his book just happens to

include an alternative vaccine schedule

and a selective vaccine schedule and on

that one you can get vaccinated for

measles as late as ten years old and on

top of that every once in a while he'll

drop a line like this you may may

statement I like to make on vaccine

there and autism is that vaccines don't

cause autism

except when they do and I know that

sounds like equivocating but

don't worry

opportunistic quacks writing books that

fanned the flames of people's unfounded

fears don't cause a legitimate public

health hazard except when they do

and what the benefits of dr. Sears in

plan are as he says theoretical the

dangers of spacing vaccines out are very

real the CDC says spreading shots out

puts children at risk of developing

diseases during the time that shots are

delayed and some of those diseases are

dangerous

measles alone was responsible for over a

hundred and thirty thousand deaths

worldwide in 2015 partly because it is

ridiculously infectious I'm talking

happy' by pharrell infectious I just

said that and it's already stuck in your

head now I'm happy there you go that's

how infectious measles is and one way we

can keep needles at bay is through

something called herd immunity that is

the concept whereby the more people who

are vaccinated the harder it is for a

disease to spread but the margin for

safety there is a lot smaller than you

may think

most experts say that the herd immunity

threshold for measles is around 95% but

when in France that dropped to 89% a few

years back this is what happened in 2007

there were around 40 cases of measles

across France then in 2008 a

ten-year-old girl returned from holiday

in Austria she went back to school and

played with some friends

several days later the girls became ill

the measles infection spread from

district to district inspecting the

susceptible population in 2011 there

were almost 15,000 cases at least six

people died okay so that clip proves two

things to us one a decrease in herd

immunity can have devastating

consequences and to anything is

terrifying if you play children's

singing frère Jacques underneath I

guarantee you that true just look at

what happens when you add that music

underneath this stock footage that we

found there is no way that those kids

are not about to be decapitated by a

stock pile no way if you're thinking

well you know that that is a chance I'm

willing to take it and I'm just making

this choice for my child

the thing is you're not you're putting

at risk kids like Rhett Crouch he was

diagnosed with leukemia at age two and

his immune system was weakened so much

he couldn't be vaccinated meaning if he

picked up a serious disease it could be

fatal and I'll let his mom take it from

here when he was first diagnosed he was

pretty much pulled out of society we

avoided highly concentrated groups of

people when we went out we were masks I

mean we really did limit his exposure

and we just were so excited for the day

when he could start kindergarten so he

could have that sense of socialization

and community and learning a year into

remission and back in school Rhett will

soon be healthy enough to be fully

vaccinated but until then his life

depends on herd immunity

exactly so by getting vaccinated you're

helping and protecting those who are

most vulnerable like sick people

and newborns too young to be vaccinated

and why would you choose not to do that

I believe Jesus Christ himself put it

best when he said do you seriously need

some sort of wise quote to convince you

on this one

just like don't be a dick and look I

know I honestly know but for some people

this is still hard but but what can help

is to try and anchor yourself to what we

know to be true about the risks of

vaccines and when it comes to autism

again there is no link and even when it

comes to other serious side effects like

a severe allergic reaction it is

literally according to the CDC close to

one in a million and I know that in a

way that's not actually helpful because

every parent thinks their child is one

in a million but if it makes you feel

better your child's odds of being

convicted of murder and eventually

executed by the state are only one in a

hundred and nineteen thousand and twelve

yes and if that makes you feel even

worse just cheer up maybe your child

will be one of those murderers that

never gets course maybe they're very

smart clearly and you know maybe one of

the biggest problems here is that when

people hear about vaccines so much of

the emphasis is on non-existence or

wildly unlikely harms and and we tend

not to talk about the very tangible good

that they do after all nobody is going

on facebook to post didn't get polio

again today

so less and maybe we kind of should

because it is easy to forget the

benefits of vaccines are enormous what

we have seen in the industrialized world

is essentially all of the major

epidemics they've vanished mums today

have every expectation that their

beautiful little baby will live and not

be polished off by de faria by Tiffany's

even occasionally by meals now that is

the transformation in young lives that

vaccines are brought and that is a

really good point

only slightly undercut by him using the

phrase polished off because it's talking

about babies not a rack of ribs here's

the thing it really comes down to this

it is likely done at some point you may

hear scary vaccine stories from other

parents or on the internet and it is

hard not to be terrified

when you encounter it and that is partly

because Parenthood in general is

terrifying

believe me I'm someone who is scared of

literally everything the dark the light

Heights depths confined spaces wide open

spaces strangers intimacy spiders and a

sudden and mysterious lack of spiders

but all of that but for what is wrong

and if this helps at all I have a son he

is 19 months old he was born prematurely

following a very difficult pregnancy and

I've worried about his health and I'm

still worried about it helped a lot but

we are vaccinating him fully on schedule

and if I can overcome the temptation to

listen to the electoral shouting of my

terrified lizard brain then I believe

that everyone can

racism you know the problem that crash

failed to solve specifically we're going

to discuss school segregation which it

turns out is still a big problem

racial segregation is on the rise the

number of schools where 1% are less if

the student population is white has more

than doubled in the last 20 years that's

true even as our society has grown more

diverse nearly 7,000 schools have the

same racial makeup as the audience of

your average Tyler Perry movie and that

one white guy is Leonard Maltin and he

has to be there it's his job boo

Ahmadiyya Halloween three stars now at

this point if you are in a city like New

York you're probably thinking Oh

splendid

I know where this is going a story

vilifying the backwards and racist

American South let me just grab a

handful of kale chips that I can munch

on while feeling superior well hold on

there is something you should probably

know according to the UCLA Civil Rights

Project the south is the least

segregated region for black students and

in fact New York State is now the most

segregated system in America

in large part due to New York City oh

we're standing

you will racist the whole time put back

those persons you bought yourselves as a

trip from fairway you don't deserve them

anymore and look it would still be

problematic even if these schools were

roughly equivalent academically as that

would still be a violation of the

principle of Brown versus Board of

Education that separate educational

facilities are inherently unequal but in

practice they are very rarely equal in

any way black and Latino children are

more likely to attend schools with

inexperienced teachers which are then

less likely to offer a college prep

curriculum on top of which because race

and class are inextricably linked those

students are six times as likely to be

in high poverty schools and while there

are teachers and students working

incredibly hard in those places they are

often doing so with fewer resources as

warm student learned during a school

exchange program once a year we do

what's called a school swap where

students that go to County High School's

attend a school in the city for one day

and then students in the city attend a

school in the county for one day I went

in and the first thing that I noticed

actually was all this stuff around her

I'm talking about stuff that looked like

it cost lots of money the teacher come

in they can get right on topic they have

multiple computers that they can use

it's like wow and then I related back to

my school well we don't have all that

okay I get what that program was trying

to do but it still seems cruel giving

students a glimpse of what other kids

are getting at least on a plane they

cover first class with a curtain and

sure they might still bake cookies and

waft the smell down the aisle but that's

just a with you so how is it possible

that our nation schools are by some

measures more segregated now than they

have been in over four decades well it

turns out places like New York haven't

so much resegregate 'add as never really

bothered integrating in the first place

because the 1964 Civil Rights Act was

very carefully crafted by northern

lawmakers it targeted the kind of

segregation by law which existed in the

south so you couldn't have a school that

was officially designated

whites-only but it exempted the

so-called racial imbalance of northern

schools so if a New York school was all

white because it was drawing from an

all-white area even if that area had

been kept that way due to a host of

explicitly racist housing policies that

was somehow fine and if you're thinking

that is some hypocritical you

are not alone Malcolm X was pointing

this out in New York at the time you

don't have to go to Mississippi to find

a segregated school system we have it

right here in New York City it shows

that the problems that there are the

white liberals have been pointing the

finger at this southern segregationist

and condemning them for exists right

here in New York City yeah of course

racism exists in New York have you never

seen West Side Story it is a musical

about love transcending the obstacle of

one person being Porto Rican it'll never

work and for what it's worth when on

rare occasions northern cities were

forced to desegregate things got just as

ugly as they did down south listen to

one Boston man described his memories of

being sent to a school in a white

neighborhood so my first day of school

was when we walked got off the school

bus was ID under step in white paint

niggers go back home to Africa you got

all these whites out to you but right

you know you know signs calling us

niggas you know go back home and then

did somebody saying kids you would see

in class so now you're like so what's up

with that yeah he's got a point there

they shall go home to Africa and then

sit beside you in class I do hope the

kids who heard that had the opportunity

to go oh you want to borrow a pencil

well I'm sorry I must have left mine in

Kenya this morning space

of the general paranoia surrounding this

issue back then just watch this trailer

for a movie called halls of anger a

handful of white students are

transferred to an all-black school you

know there's gonna be trouble vanilla

ice cream and I'm gonna take me a big

lick okay

that is clearly horrible but on a side

note using the terms chocolate and

vanilla is actually the best possible

argument for bringing races closer

together because what happens when you

combine chocolate and vanilla I'll tell

you what happens fudgie the

whale happens and it is superb and even

though the path to integration was rough

and the burden often fell

disproportionately on african-american

communities there were still clear

benefits because bringing in white

children also brought in resources to an

almost comical extent immediately when

the decision was made that white kids

would now be bused into West Charlotte

it was like a community joke like

overnight the gravel parking lot was

paved the athletic facilities in terms

of the football stadium basketball

gymnasium stuff was upgraded it was like

overnight someone had written a check

for a million dollars exactly funding

tends to follow white people around the

way white people follow the band fish

around it's a different show every time

man

last time I was rolling because I

snorted money off the communal

didgeridoo different show every time man

that man's school was in Charlotte North

Carolina a city which became a model for

how desegregation could be effective by

the end of the 1980s just 1 percent of

Latino children and 3 percent of black

children were attending schools

considered racially isolated that is 90%

or more minority and this was such a

point of pride that when President

Reagan visited and tried to talk

about Charlotte's system it didn't go

down too well they favored busing that

take centers and children out of the

neighborhood school and makes them pawns

in a social experiment that nobody wants

we found out it failed I don't call that

compassion Reagan got no reaction from

the crowd on that line I took great

offense to that not stopped across the

floor and said a few choice expletives

about to present it and cut out the TV

well that is some courtly southern

aggression I'm guessing his choice

expertise were heavens to Betsy that

really fried my grits and sir you are a

scoundrel without valor without Weller I

say

unfortunately what happened next in

Charlotte is basically the story of

desegregation in a nutshell because in

1997 a white parent got upset when his

daughter lost out in a lottery for a

magnet school which had reserved some

seats for black children and even though

she was still assigned to one of the top

ten elementary schools in the state he

filed a lawsuit I really believe that my

daughter's constitutional rights were

violated and as a concerned parent and a

responsible parent I hope I believed it

was my job to look after her well-being

okay sure but she was already in a

top-ten school and I do get making sure

that your kid has a good education is

one of the most important jobs a parent

can do it's right up there with lying

about not having a favorite child

because every parent has a favorite

child and it's Dylan it's not you it's

not any of your siblings it's Dylan just

ask your parents they like Dylan he does

his own laundry but but that man's

selfishness had a huge impact a federal

judge ruled in his favor vacating the

district's desegregation plan and

basically blowing up the whole thing and

tragically Charlotte then experienced

Swift re-segregation as by 2010 those 1

and 3 percent figures for Latinos and

blacks had grown to 44 and 47 percent

and I know it is tempting to be angry at

that one parent especially because and

this is true before the verdict even

came down he moved his family to

California which is the constitutional

challenge equivalent of farting in a

crowded elevator just as you're stepping

off of it

but to be fair this wasn't an isolated

incident all over the country

desegregation plans were struck down

thanks in part to Supreme Court rulings

making it easier to challenge them and

the prevailing narrative became that

desegregated desegregation imposed to

higher cost on students for a benefit

that was no longer necessary it's an

attitude that's best summed up by this

Louisiana State Senator do you think

that you have to bust children all over

a bossom long distance so you can say

you sit in a seat next to someone

diverse different from yourself the

Justice Department you know they achieve

their goal who can say we're not

desegregated you know an

african-american president we have an

african-american mayor here in Baton

Rouge what a majority white in the

parish we've been through all that and

there it is the idea that because

President Obama was elected systemic

racism was pretty much solved which is

absolutely absurd because racism is not

one of those things that just disappears

on its own in due time it's not like

chicken pox or Chewbacca mom and I know

I know I have just restarted the clock

on that one and I am genuinely sorry so

the only solution here is to be

proactive because remember if you just

assigned kids to their neighborhood

schools and their neighborhoods are

segregated you will have a segregated

school and clearly there are some

parents who it seems would resist just

about anything that might result in

integration just listen to how these

parents in st. Louis reacted to the idea

of students from a mostly black

community being added to their schools

so a big district send my son to a

better school when this one goes down

I deserve to not have to worry about my

children getting fat or getting robbed

because that B issue oh that is not

subtle

she's just a homies and a baggy pants

away from full dog whistle bingo and

look those parents are all extreme

examples but even if for a moment you

give everyone the benefit of the doubt

and you assume that all complaints about

bus schedules or class sizes are

actually just about buses or class sizes

the hard truth is you don't have to be

intentionally racist to do things that

have racist effects in the 60s if you

had insisted on separate lunch counters

not because you hated black people but

just because you loved your son so much

you wanted him to get his lunch quicker

the end result would have been exactly

the same and while I get the impulse to

seize every tiny advantage you can for

your kid I get that segregated schools

cause devastating harm to actual

children and not just to their education

but to their very sense of self-worth

you don't have support at all we have

black books resources anything you can

think of but when we go in contact with

these white children or a subset

Caucasian they don't know how to act

because they believe that they're better

than us and we don't know how to act

because we believe that they're better

than us and that is heartbreaking

because classrooms should teach children

about the importance of self-esteem not

rip it from them because that is what

prom is for and and there can be lasting

positive impacts to integration not

because the mere act of having a white

classmate is somehow magic it's not

unless of course that kid has round

glasses or scar on his forehead and sits

alone on parents visiting day but but

getting to attend a good middle-class

school can be transformative Berkeley

professor Rocco Johnson studied black

siblings where one went to a

desegregated school and the other didn't

and not only did those exposed to more

years of desegregation fare better but

their kids did too and that is not all

blacks who attended desegregated

elementary schools were more likely to

graduate and

22% less likely to be incarcerated as

adults

what is more Johnson found that the

narrowing of the achievement gap and the

increased success of black Americans did

not have any negative effect on whites

on any metric so it was good for black

people and have no effect on white

people whatsoever it's like this

canister of black and sassy cream shine

I am pretty sure I can make that joke

hold on hold on which writer pitched in

that doesn't help the point is for

white children a lack of experience with

people of other races can have serious

downsides just watch one young girl take

a racial bias test show me the good

child why is she the good child connect

into a fight move okay show me the bad

child why is she the bad child she's a

lot darker what do you think shocking to

you I just think it's because she's not

exposed exactly and that is why it is

important to expose kids to other races

at a young age you don't want your child

playing guess who and a birthday party

and asking is this person bad to rule

out anyone who isn't white and what and

while yes you can absolutely teach kids

about racism in the abstract if your

school is overwhelmingly white important

nuances can get lost as this second

grader found after making a bold choice

for a school project I have a dream

today I have a dream that my four little

children

they live in a nation sean is portraying

a historical figure assigned by his

teacher

well monolith the King jr. he said mom I

want to wear suit because that's what he

wore and a black tie and I have to wear

a white shirt and he said I'm also I

want to play you know do my face and

black they thought it was inappropriate

and it would be disrespectful to black

people but I say that it's not I like

that people okay

first Wow second it is obviously not

that kids fault II didn't know any

better and finally if Martin Luther King

jr. could see that clip I legitimately

don't know whether he'd be thrilled or

horrified he might actually be both he'd

be like wow I really made a difference

to a point so so the benefits of truly

diverse schools are obvious the problem

is often just our willingness to do it

at all and to their credit some school

districts including Charlotte and now

looking for ways to fix things and there

are models small and large around the

country for what can work Boston has

long had a voluntary program to send

kids from the city to schools in the

suburbs it's tiny but it's wildly

popular and Louisville has created a

complicated school assignment formula

that has resulted in more integrated

schools it is not perfect and they've

had to tweak it a lot but it is worth

knowing that under that program

90% of kindergarten families still

received their first choice of schools

which is impressive because I doubt 90%

of those families even received their

first choice of kindergartner I mean

she's great she's great she she draws on

a lot of things but she's great she's

she's fine she's absolutely fine she's

no Dylan of course because as we all

know Dylan is the best and everyone

should be invested in those sorts of

solutions because because while this

always gets framed as an issue about

parents and their children

it's actually about adults and everybody

because kids grow up and those little

doctors soldiers police officers and

superheroes asking you for candy

tomorrow night well in a decade or so

they might be actual doctors soldiers

police officers and assistant directors

of human resources

and there are massive and multiple

benefits for all of us if they

interacted a lot more from an early age

and I know this seems like a lot to ask

but in the words of a small white child

dressed as a dead civil rights leader I

have a dream

you

once the envy of all employees who work

in open-plan offices I would take a king

beaded curtain just so I don't have to

directly observe Carol clipper nails do

it at home Carol what this year one

particular wall has gotten a lot of our

attention I will build a great great

wall on our southern border at the Trump

walk beautiful walk I will build the

greatest wall that you've ever seen they

ever put my name on I want a gorgeous

wall the Trump wall will that be a

beautiful one yes Donald Trump wants to

build a wall on the US Mexican border

and based on his tone he also wants to

that wall the was such excited

fixture of his speeches of so popular

among his supporters one man even wore a

spandex war costume one of his rallies

and I mean that's kind of incredible the

only group of people more excited about

barriers are high school health teachers

oh that's right cool guys and cool girls

when you're horny there is nothing

better than a good dental dam it feels

exactly the same it doesn't it really

doesn't

the border wall is one of the few policy

proposals Trump has talked about in

detail so instead of mocking or

dismissing it out of hand tonight let's

take a series proposal by a serious

presidential candidate seriously and

first let's put aside the potential

racism and xenophobia involved here we

can come back to that later and instead

let's focus on the practicality of

whether and how it can actually be done

and let's start with the cost when Trump

first started talking about this he said

it would cost a lot but not a lot a lot

let's say the world costs 4 billion you

know they say 10 billion that means 4

billion if you know what you're doing ok

so so so he's saying he could build a

wall at 40% of what it would cost others

which I would say is an insane magic

trick if I thought his tiny fingers

could wrap all the way around a magic

wand but since then his estimate has

grown the wall is going to call six or

seven billion walls probably eight

billion dollars a wall gets built it's

gonna cost ten billion dollars to build

a wall okay it's a lot of money to wall

the walls gonna cost ten billion dollars

maybe twelve depending okay so we've

gone from four to twelve billion dollars

Donald Trump's margin of error is the

entire GDP of Moldova but still fair

enough we're now at 12 billion dollars

but but to truly know the real cost

we're gonna need to know what the wall

is going to be made from now if only

Donald Trump could explain that to me

like I'm a child you're going to build

the wall what's it going to be made out

of

hey that's a good question lift him up

here bring him up here gonna be made of

hardened concrete and it's gonna be made

out of rebar and steel okay first first

Trump is holding that child less like a

human being and more like a cat's he

just gave a bath to but but second

second to be fair rebar and steel okay

that is a clear answer I appreciate that

now now the amount we would need would

depend on the height of the wall

unfortunately Trump has been unclear on

that suggesting numbers ranging from 35

to 90 feet so let's work with his lowest

estimate at a 35 foot tall wall which

Trump has said we would need around a

thousand miles off now according to one

estimator and construction economists

that would cost 10 billion dollars for

the concrete panels and 5 to 6 billion

for steel columns including labor plus

another billion for concrete footing for

the columns and a concrete foundation so

that's at least 16 billion dollars

we're already four billion over his

largest budget and we've only just

gotten started here because those

materials are heavy and you're gonna

have to transport them into many areas

that are currently inaccessible to

construction vehicles so that same

expert estimates another two billion

dollars to build roads so that 20-ton

trucks can deliver those materials and

that's not even getting into another 30%

or so for engineering design and

management so now we're up to around

twenty five billion dollars anywhere

from two to six times Trump's estimates

but wait because we're still not done

all of that is just building a wall the

Congressional Budget Office estimated

for a similar project that wall

maintenance costs would exceed the

initial construction costs within seven

years so it's a big dumb thing that only

gets more expensive over time it's like

getting a pet walrus you think it's

stupid now what until you learn what a

bucket of sea cucumbers costs

you've not prepared for that but but

whatever the cost is Trump claims he has

got a way to pay for it Mexico is going

to pay for the war

going to pay for the war Mexico is going

to pay for the war Mexico is gonna pay

for the wall and they're gonna be happy

about it of course they are of course

that people love it when you make them

pay for they don't want that's why

everyone is so happy when their cable

company bundles together cable internet

and landline that will come in handy

when I need to call my cell phone

because I can't find it and that's about

it but is Mexico going to pay for the

wall because the current Mexican

Treasury Secretary has said Mexico under

no circumstance is going to pay for the

wall that mr. Trump is proposing and two

former Mexican presidents were even

clearer Mexican people we are not going

to pay any single cent for a such a

stupid wall as you care I'm not gonna

fail you for that I think the best part

of that clip is the fact that he even

took the extra effort to swear in

English hey this may be my second

language but I want to make absolutely

sure youth understand it but when Trump

was asked about these comments he

responded with characteristic diplomacy

the wall just got 10 feet taller believe

me ten feet tall come on things don't

get bigger just because you're angry if

that were true Alec Baldwin would be a

hundred feet tall by now now to be fair

to be fair here Trump has thought

through how he will get Mexico to foot

the bill we have right now a fifty eight

billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico

that's why the wall gets built by the

way that's why they're gonna pay for it

okay I see I think Mexico will pay

because we have a trade deficit I

understand unfortunately that's

literally not how anything works because

well yes we did buy fifty eight billion

dollars more in goods and services from

Mexico than they did from us last year

that money doesn't belong to the Mexican

government it's earned by Mexican

businesses it's not lying around in some

centralized scrooge mcduck

been labeled dumb Americans money do not

spend on border fence let's put all this

aside and let's say we did find the

money where would we put a border wall

now your instinct says on the border but

even that is actually more difficult

than it sounds and we know this because

in 2006 George W Bush scientist secure

Fence Act which called for the

construction of 700 miles of fencing

along the border a project which

incidentally then senators Barack Obama

and Hillary Clinton voted for which is

terrible although keep in mind that

millions of you voted for Taylor Hicks

in 2006 so we don't be quite so quick to

judge

so patrol that fence that vets ran into

a lot of problems though for instance in

large stretches of Texas the border

consists of the Rio Grande and typically

you can't build a wall along the river

as a 1970 treaty prohibits building

anything that may cause obstruction of

normal flow of the river and for that

and other reasons some stretches of the

border fence were built considerably

inland and as towns like Brownsville

Texas have learned that can be a problem

this here is the Rio Grande River as

cuts all the way you can see it makes a

natural Crescent there this is Mexico

all back here here's where the walls

built so all of this golf course is now

stuck in between Mexico and this border

fence it's true that golf course was

stuck between the u.s. border fence and

Mexico in a space that like the case of

Diablo Pajarito occurred over isn't

really American but sure as isn't

Mexican

as the ridiculousness of this situation

was not lost on the people who played

there you realize when you're golfing

here that you're in them you're not

really in the United States or Mexico

here

I don't care where I am as long as I'm

off course you think it's helping with

security no I think I think that woman

just said in two words what I'm taking

20 minutes to say in this piece does the

fence help no stupid I look Texas became

a real problem for constructing that

fence because in Texas unlike in other

states there is no federally owned

buffer along the Mexican border meaning

the land is mostly owned by private

citizens like the loop family who owned

a ranch in Texas and discovered that

three-quarters of their land would

suddenly be on the other side of the

fence

when Homeland Security asked the loops

to sign away rights to their land for

the fence they said no way I'm not

finding anything at this point

nothing this is not possible so the

government used the power of eminent

domain and condemned their property Wow

and the loops were not alone hundreds of

property owners were sued by the federal

government so the fence could be built

perhaps the only silver lining here

might be that historically in America

when the federal government takes your

land and treats you terribly

you at least get an offensive football

team named after you so I guess one day

we can all look forward to the

Washington loops hey it's a sign of

respect that respecting their heritage

why can't you understand that and the

fences damage didn't stop there because

Michael Chertoff then Secretary of

Homeland Security signed a document

giving his department the authority to

waive 36 laws to build the fence

including the Endangered Species Act the

Safe Drinking Water Act and the Native

American graves protection and

repatriation Act he even welded parts of

the fence himself wearing an American

Eagle facemask and he looks like a

member of Daft Punk

if Daft Punk played nothing but Lee

Greenwood covers

and that Native American grave laws came

in horrifyingly handy as this Native

American leader explains fragments of

human remains were found in heavy

equipment tracks on the Christian ranch

archaeological site a site now crossed

by barrier barriers and the border road

imagine a bulldozer in your family

graveyard I mean say what you will but I

think imagine a bulldozer in your family

graveyard is definitely the worst verse

of John Lennon's Imagine it's not my

favorite it is not my favorite and by

waiving the protections for wildlife the

fence has posed dangers to the survival

in the u.s. of everything from Jaguars

to pronghorns to pygmy owls and look how

shocked they look by that fact although

although I will admit they do

permanently look like you've just

murdered their entire families Trump

might well argue having a wall is worth

all of this because it will act as a

fortress to stop people and drugs

flowing across the border but let's look

at that because the most recent

authoritative estimate suggests nearly

half of the unauthorized migrants in the

u.s. entered legally through a port

eventually like an airport or a border

crossing usually with visas that they

then overstayed a wall can't stop that

it's like wearing a condom to protect

against head lice you could do that but

that's not really how you keep the thing

you're worried about from happening

which is not to say that there are not

some people crossing the border where a

wall would be but what a wall really

stopped them what the Border Patrol says

and I've spoken to a lot of their people

is look first of all if you build a

30-foot wall all its gonna do is create

a market for 31-foot ladders of course

of course that's right and I by the way

remember when you're looking for a

31-foot ladder avoid Werner climbing a

werner ladder is like dousing yourself

in cooking grease and climbing a pile of

tetanus do yourself a favor and get into

walt ladder and i'm not being paid to

say that i'm just a fan

a very happy customer and ladders are

not the walls only weakness watch as

Donald Trump inadvertently stumbles his

way into a key realization so you take

precast plank it comes 30 feet along 40

feet along 50 feet long there's no

ladder going over that if they ever get

up there they're in trouble cuz there's

no way to get down maybe you're up yeah

this may be a rope yes yes your

brilliant plan has been undone by

mankind's third invention and as for

stopping drugs walls and fences have not

posed much of a challenge to cartels in

Mexico police have discovered a tunnel

believed to have been used to smuggle

drugs into the u.s. using this makeshift

cannon they were shooting packages small

packages of marijuana across the border

these men were actually using a catapult

to launch drugs across the border other

smugglers have kept it a bit simpler

than that they just get somebody with a

really good arm who throws it over the

fence like a football okay okay well

we'll say if they're looking for a new

recruit

I know Peyton Manning is currently

between jobs but let's face it for many

people efficacy is beside the point

this wall is about making us feel safer

and here is where the racism and

xenophobia that we put aside at the top

of this piece really needs to be brought

back because while other politicians

have supportive barriers at the border

Donald Trump has been uncommonly clear

about who we need to be protected from

when Mexico sends its people they're not

sending their best they're bringing

drugs they're bringing crime they're

rapists and some I assume are good

people

Trump Trump sounds like an angry

villager running through the town square

yelling werewolves Run For Your Lives

though some I assume are good werewolves

but they're here to kill you with maybe

a few exceptions but mostly werewolves

run run

we're werewolves love me and I love

werewolves but they're here to kill all

of us but but about that because while

yes individual undocumented immigrants

have committed horrible crimes so

obviously have American citizens and in

fact researchers consistently find that

immigrants are less not more crime prone

than their native-born counterparts the

crime rates among immigrants once here

are relatively tiny digits which is

something Donald Trump should frankly

understand given that he has ten of them

attached take these minuscule you wish

to say that the idea of the war is not

still comforting for some people or as

one man who actually lives near the

border puts it this was put out to

illustrate to Joe whoever up in Dubuque

or someplace they see a picture of this

and they're overstuffed butts and an

overstuffed chair looking at a to big TV

think oh yeah that'll stop them well of

course it doesn't this guy is amazing

on the fat cat out of touch

metropolis that is Dubuque Iowa but even

if it does make the people of Dubuque

feel safer given everything we've seen

is it worth it because remember we

calculated earlier that this could

conservatively cost twenty five billion

dollars excluding the cost of both

maintenance and the land under it that

works out to around seventy seven

dollars per person and here is where I

would like to make a counterproposal to

Donald Trump's wall plan if the main

thing is going to get us is a warm sense

of satisfaction inside I suggest instead

of building that wall we use the money

to buy every man woman and child in

America a parmer waffle iron these

beauties retail at $75 apiece so we'd

still have nearly a billion dollars left

over and just to be clear this isn't one

per household this is one per person you

have five people in your family you got

five waffle irons coming your way

not only is this cost-effective unless

you are a really sick this waffle

iron plan would not kill a single pygmy

owl I know what you're thinking John

this is a stupid idea but is it is it

really yes

obviously it is but is it significantly

stupider than Donald Trump's wall

because this waffle iron plan will cost

less it'll do nearly as much to keep out

immigrants and drugs it won't harm our

relationship with our third largest

trading partner if it is racist it's

only toward Belgians and and unlike

Donald Trump's wall

this makes king waffles what kind of

country do we want to wake up to one

that spends billions on an impossible

impractical symbol of fear or one that

smells like breakfast

exactly

as you know our show is dedicated to

covering the biggest news of the week

whatever that news may be we have a long

proud one-week history of doing that so

what was the biggest news story of this

week we begin in Oklahoma tonight with

an execution that didn't go as planned

a convicted killer from Oklahoma dies

after a botched execution

okay okay okay I know what you're

thinking you're thinking white you know

you're not gonna really do a comic take

on the death penalty right it's your

second episode I haven't even decided if

I like this show yet

well you're right don't change the

channel we don't have to talk about the

death penalty no one is forcing us to in

the application of the death penalty in

this country we have seen significant

problems I think we do have to as a

society ask ourselves some some

difficult and profound questions do we

do we really have to do that can you not

just answer those question for us

because I do not want to talk about the

death penalty and judging by the noise

that you make when you talk about it

neither do you what happened in Oklahoma

is deeply troubling

I know that sound that's the sound of a

man drowning on dry land desperately

hoping for Biden to suddenly walk out

into the gopro's garden in an open road

oh god John Oh Jose here thank god

you're here ah let's lighten the mood

everyone let's talk about Benghazi okay

okay so let's do this then let's talk

about the death penalty and before you

turn this show off there was a YouTube

video this week of tiny hamsters eating

tiny burrito it's as magical and as

uncomplicated as you think and if you

make it to the end of this story I

promise we will watch it together okay

so you have to stay with us you have to

stay with us to get it okay so the death

penalty should it exist and what should

its limits be can someone give me a

broad almost infantile guideline of when

they think it's appropriate the Supreme

Court has already told us that the death

penalty is constitutional I will do

believe in the death penalty but but

only with respect to those who are

guilty of committing the crime okay

bones idea

we shouldn't execute innocent people I

think most people would probably agree

with that you sir are a regular Atticus

Finch but but executing the innocent is

not really the tough question here is

whether we should be executing the

guilty and let me acknowledge right up

front that I come to this as a bit of an

outsider Britain does not have capital

punishment so in a way I really don't

know what I'm talking about

but in another way I really do know what

I'm talking about because before 1965 we

didn't just have capital punishment we

literally went medieval on people's

asses the history of capital punishment

in Britain is a long and bloody one

since the Middle Ages laws condemned to

death have variously faced the

boiled alive burnt at the stake or hung

drawn and quartered yeah we did that we

boils people and in the grand tradition

of British cuisine if anything we over

boiled them we boil them up

we we loved killing people so much we

kept coming up with new inventive

techniques that look like they were

designed by the marquis de sade and

named by willy wonka this is the head

crusher the small and seemingly

innocuous thumb biter originates in 14th

century Scotland these devices have

almost childlike names like penny

Winkies that's right

penny wink is a delightful English

cousin of the throaty tugtug and the

jolly shocky buzz-buzz tickly wickley

since I know I know that all of this is

still technically horrifying but that's

kind of the point because whether you

are boiling people alive or putting them

to sleep with a tiny injection

administered by a puppy dressed as

Winnie the Pooh in the end you are

getting the same result and here's the

thing just because the British people

don't have the death penalty anymore

doesn't mean that we don't want it back

recent polls suggest that at least half

the population would choose to have it

reinstated which makes complete sense

because the death penalty is one of

those things that is natural to want but

you shouldn't necessarily have the death

penalty is like the McRib when when you

can't have it it's so tantalizing but as

soon as they bring it back you think

this is epically wrong should this be

allowed in a civilised society and by

the way there is your new slogan Magrib

you are welcome you are welcome you can

have that for free that's yours

because because there are things about

having the death penalty which might

make you a little bit queasy what does

the United States have in common with

Iran Iraq and Saudi Arabia the answer is

the death penalty according to Amnesty

International those four nations and

China are responsible for 82 percent of

the world's executions look this is

gonna seem like a gross simplification

but any list that contains Iran Iraq

Saudi Arabia and China is not a list you

want to be on ideally you want to be on

one of those lists that Finland is on

Finland Finland is on all the good lists

like countries with the best pastries or

best countries to host your overseas

lesbian wedding and I know I know what

some of you are thinking but John I hear

you saying that most Western countries

no longer have executions but if someone

committed a heinous crime I would still

very much like to kill them okay well

let's start with if there have been 312

DNA exonerations in this country since

we've been doing forensic testing one

life in parole how things which were

once considered complete airtight

evidence against somebody are now sort

of being viewed as junk shut science

isn't it interesting is interesting

really the word that you're looking for

there Cooper facts found on Snapple caps

are interesting that the Statue of

Liberty's nose is four feet six inches

long hot that's an interesting fact

but facts like innocent people are

potentially executed by our government

on a regular basis and not so much

interesting as horrifying put it

this way if you found that on the bottom

of a Chobani lid that would like I can

tell you of Chobani even harder to

swallow than it already is and look look

statistics suggest that false

convictions aren't all that rare I this

week we are learning from the

Proceedings of the National Academy of

Sciences a study that shows four percent

of death row inmates are innocent

I think you might be using the wrong

tone 4%

well the outrage about this must be off

the charts I remember a certain Texas

governor who felt that for individual

cases of voter impersonation in the last

decade was a moral issue important to

address thank any person who does not

want to see fraud believes in having

good open honest elections transparent

well we take it to the Supreme Court to

the Supreme Court over a voter

impersonation rate essentially close to

zero percent so a potential executing

the innocent rate of 4% must really eat

away at Rick Perry your state has

executed 234 death row inmates more than

any other governor in modern times have

you have you struggled to sleep at night

with the idea that any one of those

might have been innocent no sir I've

never struggled with that at all nope I

never struggled with it in fact I sleep

great like a big muscular baby 14 hours

or not legs in the air with a mobile

above my head crying when I myself

I'm a big baby I sleep like a baby but

ok ok let's imagine for a moment a

magical world where you could be sure of

someone's guilt what are the arguments

for killing them then is it that it's a

deterrent to others there is no credible

evidence that the death penalty is a

particular deterrent to violent crime

although to be fair the death penalty is

an amazing deterrent to fishing without

a license

listen Todd I'd love to go with you but

is it worth it you've got a wife and

children so what about the argument then

that we shouldn't have to pay to house

and feed a convicted killer an average

death penalty case

cost the state millions of dollars in

California alone since 1978 the total

cost of enforcing the death penalty has

been over four billion dollars that's

308 million dollars for each of the 13

executions carried out in fact it costs

up to 10 times more to give someone the

death penalty than life in prison so

what a death sentence is really saying

is hey this is America and the way we

treat the most despicable members of our

society is by spending the entire budget

of the Lord of the Rings trilogy on them

so what what we know now is the death

penalty is expensive potentially kills

innocent people and doesn't deter crime

and here is where it gets hard harder

than is potentially appropriate for a

comedy show late on a Sunday night but

if we are going to answer difficult and

profound questions as the president told

us to the toughest one is probably if

someone is guilty of committing a

horrible crime and the family of the

victim want the perpetrator executed do

we want to live in the kind of country

that gives that to them I would say no

you might very reasonably say yes or at

the very least

but

but it's a question that is going to

need an answer and in the meantime a

much easier question is do you want to

watch a YouTube video of a tiny hamster

eating a tiny burrito it's at this point

at this point you have earned it

and that is how you end a comprehensive

segment on the death penalty

astroturfing which sounds like a new

teen trend of artificial grass

while eating cascade pods that's right

the teens have moved on from tide it's

all about cascade now astroturf ping is

the practice of corporations or

political groups disguising themselves

as spontaneous authentic popular

movements it's basically fake grassroots

that's why they call it astroturf II

it's a very funny very clever name

now you're probably familiar with

astroturf II as a concept from C ads by

groups with a generic populist sounding

names like Americans against food taxis

delivering weirdly specific messages

like these Washington is talking about a

new tax on Jews rates of soda they say

it's only pennies

well those pennies add up when you're

trying to feed a family

Washington if you're listening but

doesn't seem like much to you can be a

lot to us

tell Congress no taxes on juice drinks

and sodas well it won't surprise you to

learn that Americans against food taxes

was not started by regular Americans

pooling their resources together to take

out a large ad buy on national TV about

their number one problem priority a

proposed soda tax no it was a front

group for the food and beverage industry

which makes a lot more sense soda

companies have a lot of money at least

enough to convince the LeBron James to

pretend he drinks sprite sprite diabetes

you can taste and and well you might

think well yeah but that's obvious I'd

never fall for astroturf like

that

don't be quite so sure because with dark

money surging in the wake of decisions

like citizens united astroturf

techniques are now becoming more

sophisticated effective and dangerous

and they are not going away so tonight

we thought it might be useful to take a

look at some of those techniques to help

us better spot them in the future

let's just start with the names

themselves because sometimes groups are

created with deliberately misleading

names for instance the group save our

tips which purportedly speaks for

waitstaff is an anti minimum wage

increase group funded by restaurant

owners the National wetlands coalition

worked on behalf of oil companies and

real estate developers and the American

Council on science and health has been

funded by among other things

fracking interests soda companies each

cigarette companies and chemical

manufacturers so it's pure straight-up

opposite world it's like if this show is

called funny time happy hour with

shuttle honks John Oliver

it's just demonstrable false we can't

back that up and look it's not

always easy to spot exactly what the

group's motive is especially with an ad

like this don't eat here

what's with your people tossing money at

the Humane Society of the United States

these HSUS losers aren't even affiliated

with your local pet shelter for more

information go to humane watch.org that

is a very strange ad because first of

all if you're going to have a talking

dog what would you make him such a gruff

asshole hey I'm Tony and I'm mad

the Humane Society's a bunch of losers

and if you disagree you can suck my dark

dick

and second second who would take out an

attack ad on the Humane Society a rival

even humane er society puppy mills

self-loathing dogs it's impossible to

say for sure all I can tell you is that

ad is the work of Rick Berman

a PR expert who's known in the industry

as dr. evil he is known for his defences

of controversial products from

secondhand smoke to trans fats to payday

loans he's also created nonprofit groups

that have fought regulation of all of

those things in fact it's one of those

groups the concentr the Center for

Consumer Freedom which was credited on

that Humane Society attack ad so if is

the Center for Consumer Freedom a front

group full Berman's corporate clients is

it at all relevant that Rick Berman has

shown up at events for the pork industry

and industry which has been targeted by

the Humane Society in the past for the

use of gestation crates or as Rick

Berman insists on calling them maternity

pens I can't say I legally can't say I

want to are badly wanted but I've been

explicitly told I can't you can probably

guess but I can't say it out loud what I

can say is that Berman rejects any

accusation that he runs front groups for

corporate clients saying there is no

front because there is total

transparency which is a little odd

considering we don't know who's behind

many of his campaigns and that message

of transparency does seem to

significantly change whenever he's

behind closed doors because here is

audio of Berman pitching his services to

a group of oil executives people always

ask me one question you said how do I

know is that I won't be found out as a

supporter of what you're doing we run

all of this stuff through nonprofit

organization

that are insulated from having to

disclose donors total anonymity see

transparency but look look he is right

there is total anonymity and just as a

general rule if the most common question

you get asked is how do I know no one

will find out on doing business with you

that's not a great sign if the same

privacy guarantee that Hardee's gives

all of its customers don't worry none of

your friends family or coworkers will

ever find out that you've been doing

this now go and enjoy your monster

thickburger before the horse meat gets

cold

but astroturfing is more way more than

just funneling money through nonprofit

front groups groups can also recruit

questionable experts to lend their

arguments credibility there are multiple

examples of this but my favorite

concerns a group called citizens for

fire safety a few years back health

officials in California wanted to remove

a requirement that furniture contained

chemical flame retardants as they had

been linked to cancer but citizens for

fire safety produced a burn surgeon dr.

David heimbach who argued for keeping

all of those flame-retardant

requirements by telling them a pretty

memorable story 7 week old baby was in a

crib laying on a fire-retardant mattress

on a non-fire retardant pillow mom put a

candle in the crib candle fell over the

baby sustained a 50-percent burn the

entire upper half of her body was burned

oh this is a tiny little person no

bigger than my Italian Greyhound at home

she ultimately died after about three

weeks of pain and misery in the hospital

now that sounds horrifying but there are

some weird things about what he just

said first I don't know why he felt the

need to compare the size of a baby to

his Italian Greyhound

everyone knows what size our baby is

nobody's never seen a baby so wait it's

like a person but smaller tell me more

doesn't use stilts how does it board a

bus what I'm picturing is something

about the size of five hamsters taped

together a very small lawnmower a mine

around the right ballpark here but

second if part of you there was

wondering hold on

who puts a candle in their baby's crib

you're not alone journalists with the

Chicago Tribune wondered the exact same

thing and they soon discovered that two

years earlier home back and testified

before a different California panel

telling a weirdly similar story I will

tell you about a child I took care of in

April mom had a candle for sitting at

beside the bed left the room for seven

minutes for reasons we don't know the

child that candle turned over the child

sustained an 80 percent burn okay so now

this is starting to sound a little

suspicious how many people are putting

lit candles in and around their baby's

cribs oh I just put little Ethan to bed

I put plenty of lit candles in his crib

as a nightlight and I balance several

sharp knives and open cancer pain filler

right on the crib wall so he has

something to look at look look home back

wasn't done because just a year later he

was testifying before the state

legislature in Alaska and guess what a

six week old baby that I took care of

earlier this year mother went away there

was a candle on the bureau somehow the

dog knocked the candle onto the crib and

the little girl sustained this seventy

five percent very devastating burn wait

so now there's a dog involved all of a

sudden what kind of dog would do such a

thing wait a second I know exactly what

kind of dog a gruff needlessly Italian

dog like tongue

by God but God as if as if sensing that

lawmakers there were questioning his

motives

the very next centers the home back said

completely unprompted was this I am not

in the pocket of anybody that makes a

specific flame retardant now so be fair

he's actually right about that he was

not in the pocket of someone that made a

specific flame retardant he was however

in the pocket of citizens for fire

safety who paid him $240,000 for his

help and who it turned out only had

three members which were the three

largest makers of flame retardants in

the world so I call it liar liar pants

chemically incapable of catching on fire

oh and what Northey when a reporter

called the medical examiner's office

they had no record of any burn victim

matching heimbach's description

whatsoever so one of them did the next

logical thing i thought the best thing

to do was just to call him at home i

said those kids you talked about did

they all die in your hospital he said it

wasn't factual it was anecdotal and i

said but that's not what you testified

and he said well I wasn't under oath

okay okay

well first of all you're generally

expected to tell the truth even when

you're not under oath and second of all

anecdotes aren't the same as lies I saw

Keri Russell walking out of a bakery

that's an anecdote it's not a good

anecdote but it is an anecdote I saw

Keri Russell riding a dragon out of a

bakery that is a lie although admittedly

would be a way better story and look the

real problem there is home backs lies

worked that flame-retardant bill in

California initially failed thanks in

part to his testimony and and the final

and paps most controversial tool in

astro surfing relates to something that

our current president actually loves to

complain about I'll tell you what you

take a look outside

these are paid protesters folks the

protesters are paid a lot of money by

the DNC it turned out that the

protesters were used to have

we're bought for $1,500 apiece we have a

protester by the way were you paid

$1,500 to be a thug

now I can't walk it quite out there is

Trump angry or is he excited he's just

stumbled onto a job opportunity that

John Julie and Eric would actually be

qualified for but for what Russ specific

accusations were nonsense

hey demonstrators do exist which Trump

should frankly know himself because his

campaign reportedly had actors who were

paid $50 to cheer for him and his

campaign announcement but but paid

demonstrators are one of the most

infuriating tools of astroturfing just

just look at what happened last year in

New Orleans

a company called Entergy needed city

council approval for a controversial

power plant which it got not long after

a public meeting where by sheer chance a

bunch of huge power plant fans in orange

shirts turned up now it later emerged

that a PR firm working for Entergy hired

a company called crowds on demand which

recruited actors to supports in the

plants they did this with a facebook ad

which offered and I quote 60 to $200 e

dues to help with a gig for three hours

which in itself right there is a red

flag dollar e dues sounds like slang for

money that you'd find in a Mark Twain

novel called even for the 1800s there

are way too many n words in this crowd

of demands even provided talking points

such as folks this is 2017 we had a boil

water advisory here last month and I'm

tired of feeling like I live in a third

world country and it seems like some of

the people there took those notes and

ran with them I'm tired of feeling like

we're living in a third world country

this is the United States of America its

2017 going on 2018 and we have to worry

about these frequent water boil

advisories and so on and so forth I have

to be concerned that a grandmother or a

son or a pet could possibly drink or

take in some brain-eating ameba

yeah I'll give him credit for that last

but the brain-eating ameba bit was all

his own he was just riffing hard at that

point now now that man insists that he

believed everything he said and that he

wasn't paid by crowds on demand although

you should know that another person

there who does admit to being paid said

he received instructions that read a few

things to keep in mind one tell nobody

will being paid to tell nobody you're

being paid three media will be present

do not talk to them for tell nobody

you're being paid and five if somebody

approaches you don't tell them you're

being paid which are and this is true

word-for-word the vows in a traditional

Scientology wedding now if you look

they're beautiful vows and you should go

now if you are wondering who is behind

crowds on demand let me introduce you to

their CEO Adam Swart the answer to the

question what if a lukewarm bottle of

smirnoff ice was a person now now he's

he's pretty unrepentant about what his

firm does have you ever provided

protesters for an event of course

demonstrators of course do you see

anything wrong with that personally nope

do you ever feel like you're tricking

people though into getting behind

something that they may have not gotten

behind if they didn't see all this

activity there we don't trick people we

engage them yeah yeah but you engage

them by tricking them don't you both

both of those things can be true at the

same time it's like someone saying I'm

not masturbating in the middle of this

Pinkberry

I'm just engaging the police department

you're actually doing both and one

doesn't make the other okay now of

course what's whole ruse is predicated

on people holding their nerve and not

giving the game away in real time but

amazingly that has happened in the small

town of Camarillo

I think the city needs a shake of

citizens aren't shy about expressing

their opinions but one chilly Wednesday

night in December Prince

Jordan Tyson city officials say this man

stood out this case is clearly common

sense because for three minutes he told

the City Council what he later admits

was a lie I'm just a concerned citizen

coming up here and speaking to you but

he's not he's a self-described

struggling actor from Beverly Hills it

goes by the name of Prince Jordan Tyson

okay no I don't believe it I do not

believe it does anything about this face

this face say struggling actor from

Beverly Hills to you I'm sorry this

story just doesn't check out but

incredibly it's true because while they

know Toya's pjt initially claims to be

from the area he soon had a crisis of

confidence culminating in this forty

minutes later

Tyson came back to the podium Prince is

back for one of the strangest moments

the City Council has ever seen I don't

agree with the reason I'm here and I was

paid to be here how much were you paid

hundred bucks how much $100 you're

idiot Prince you just broke

ground on Tim Barnes rules one two four

and five now you won't get those

hundred-dollar e dues which could have

gone toward changing your name to

literally anything else or getting a

haircut that doesn't make you look like

an out dente Owen Wilson when you add

all of this together faith groups hiring

fake experts and fake crowds which

managed to affect real world change it

gets pretty dispiriting and it can do

real damage that goes way beyond the

narrow issues that each group is trying

to influence the very existence of

companies like crowds on demand mean

that something authentic can now be

tainted in fact conspiracy boards now

regularly and wrongly cite crowds on

demand as providing everything from paid

protesters for Charlottesville to crisis

actors for the Las Vegas shooting and

that is hugely dangerous because the

consequences of this cannot be that

everyone assumes that anyone who doesn't

agree with them is astroturf you know

what while skepticism is healthy

cynicism real cynicism is toxic and

because this problem isn't going it away

going away it is now even more incumbent

on us to use our judgment diligently if

the Ray Liotta of docks is telling us

the Humane Society is terror

it's probably worth us all asking why

why who might have trained him and what

do they stand to gain and unfortunately

until we find out a way to force

astroturf groups to be more transparent

and accountable that's about all we can

do right now astroturf is a serious

threat to our public discourse and it is

critical that we are all much more aware

of its dangers

and since astroturf furs have left all

their tools lying around at the very

least we might as well use them to fight

candle fire with candle fire and deliver

a heartfelt message we're all Americans

real people definitely not actors were

just a coalition of Concerned doctors

mothers teachers and kidnappers and we

think you deserve the truth about

astroturf furs here are the facts

astroturf furs are responsible for every

shark attack in American history wonder

all the B's have gone after jurors shot

him in the face and according to the

bipartisan Institute of factual science

studies every single astroturf fur has

killed at least one puppy with their

bare hands or maybe not we're not under

oath the point is that's what surfers

set this baby on fire that's not a dog

that's a real baby no bigger than an

Italian Greyhound

her name's Eleanor and she likes for

things but binky hood Bava corporate and

political transparency and not being on

fire and right now

Elinor is open for and if you're not

careful one day a pastor is going to

come to your house and like your baby

fire stop and structure they paid for by

citizens for fresh orange juice

you

state attorneys general and yes that is

the correct plural and if you already

knew that I'm sorry that high school was

such a rough time for you believe me I

know being a teenage grammar nerd is

something from which it is difficult to

recover and look I do realize that they

show about state AG's sounds like a

tedious prospect just watch the start of

this 2006 panel discussion on c-span in

front of an electrified crowd our panel

today features three distinguished and

very very different and bipartisan

attorneys general I gotta say that was a

bit of a dick move by the c-span camera

man there he didn't have to pan across

those empty seats but he did it anyway

as if to say look even the panel's

friends didn't show up and I'll tell you

what that panel did wrong actually if

you want a live audience to listen to

you talk about state AG's simply don't

tell them in advance we filmed this show

in front of a live audience

you think we told them what this shows

about of course not they were explicitly

told that this was a taping of the

Rachael Ray Show and I promise she'll be

out any minute now but look it is worth

the effort to learn about state AG's

because they are very important and yet

most of us probably don't know who ours

is although if you live in Indiana I am

very excited to introduce you to yours

please meet Curtis Hill AG by day

although by night something very much

different I was toying around with it

and discovered that I sounded sorta like

Elvis we're caught in a trap I can't

walk out

because I love you too much baby

we saw the Attorney General do all the

hits I don't know if you've noticed but

I don't look much like Elvis to be

honest I'd noticed that frankly it's

difficult to notice anything besides the

most sadistic inseam in the history of

tailoring that looks like a marshmallow

bisected with fishing wire and that's

all it looks like most ladies are

actually elected meaning they belong to

political parties and they run campaign

ads like this striking one from Michigan

when you're choosing Michigan's next

Attorney General ask yourself this who

can you trust most not to show you their

penis in a professional setting is that

the candidate who doesn't have a penis

I'd say so well certainly and arguments

although to be honest if you asking me

which candidate I trust most not to show

me their penis I'd have to go with

dickless Dennis he he can't show me his

penis why that mean old raccoon still

has it that woman is running for

attorney general in Michigan it's one of

30 states where voters will be selecting

their next AG on November 6th and those

elections are going to be unusually

competitive some estimate that more than

a hundred million dollars will be spent

on AG races this year that's up to three

times more than ever before so tonight

let's look at who AG's are what they do

and why they matter and let's start with

what they do because typically they

serve as a state's chief legal officer

and the people's loyal with

responsibilities ranging from a criminal

law enforcement to consumer advocacy to

and everything in between

the landmark multi-billion dollar

tobacco industry settlement in the 90s

the one that killed Joe Camel that was

thanks to state AG's this year's

blockbuster report on abuses by the

Catholic Church in Pennsylvania that was

thanks to a state AG you know who put

out that raging wildfire in Northern

California

that was firefighters use your head why

would state AG's have been involved in

that use your instincts here

the fact is the fact is though AG's

often work on politically neutral

matters and they still do but in recent

decades they've also become

significantly more partisan one small

sign of this is that while all AG's

belong to the National Association of

attorneys general or nag around two

decades ago Republicans formed a

separate committee just for them raga

and the Democrats followed suit with

dagger and I do know that rocket and

dagger sound like twins from Dutch

folklore that teach children about right

and wrong

Rocka always milks the cow when its

udders are swollen but darker is off

making nonsense with a goose

when darker is given no dinner this is

justice but arguably the most

high-profile way in which this job has

become more partisan is the extent to

which a GS belonging to one party have

teamed up to bring lawsuits against the

federal government now that used to be

relatively rare but starting in the

Obama years the number of those sort of

lawsuits skyrocketed

it was Republican AG's who successfully

limited the Medicaid expansion of

Obamacare and suing the government

became a point of pride for AG's like

Texas's Greg Abbott what I do is I go

into the office I sue the federal

government and then I go home

I've sued the Obama administration now

25 times over the last four years yeah

but that is not the smirk of a guy who

just goes into the office sues the

government and goes home is it that's

the smoke of a guy who goes into the

office sues the government adjust the

office thermostat without telling anyone

steal someone's sandwich from the fridge

farts in the elevator and then goes home

now Apple has since gone on to become

governor of Texas but his successor Ken

Paxton was no less eager to sue the

Obama administration just listened to

his wife proudly describing Paxton's

love for lawsuits in what apparently I

legally have to call a song I'm a

pistol-packing mama yes I

I'm a pistol-packing mama

Esaias I'm a pistol-packing mama and my

husband sues Obama again I never thought

I would say this but I would honestly

rather listen to moose knuckle Elvis

Shirley Temple get up in his living room

in a too-tight onesie now

Paxton himself is actually a really good

example of how a state AG's political

views can significantly impact their

work

he told County Clerk's that they could

refuse to issue marriage licenses to

same-sex couples he was a lead plaintiff

in a lawsuit that shot down an Obama era

rule that would have made four million

people eligible for overtime pay and

when the Obama administration tried to

extend protections for transgender kids

in public schools

Paxton sued and said this any man that

decides that they wanted to clear

themselves to be female for the day can

walk into your daughter's locker room or

bathroom it now opens the door for

anybody no matter what they are and how

they're thinking they can change their

gender for a day and have the ability to

walk into a women's locker room it's

just not right what the are you

talking about obvious bigotry aside

transgender people don't just switch

identity for convenience they are human

beings not read frogs that's right read

frogs

should the need arise can spontaneously

change from female to male I just hit

you with an unexpected frog fact in the

middle of talking about state attorneys

general I know what you're thinking

where the is Rachael Ray

in the next village I'm gonna write just

be patient be patient

she'll be here she's making frittatas

and you're all going to have a taste

now should be here just be patient

now now now Paxton has actually spent

almost his entire time in office under

indictment and is awaiting trial for

securities fraud but that is not evenly

ken Paxton related allegation I would

like to show you instead I'd like to

focus on one mentioned in a real attack

ad from his current opponent this is the

collin county courthouse where a dallas

attorney accidentally left a $1,000 pen

at the metal detectors this is Ken

Paxton the indicted Texas Attorney

General rummaging through the metal

detector trays and stealing that $1,000

pen and this is Ken Paxton the indicted

Texas Attorney General walking away with

a stolen pen vote Justin Nelson for

Texas Attorney General he will fight on

behalf of all Texans and he won't steal

no pain yes that's a relief although

thanks to that ad earlier I would also

like to know that he won't steal my pen

or show me his penis or for that matter

shown me his pen or steal my penis I

wouldn't need to know all his positions

on the penis pen show-steal continuum

still the larger point is state AG's are

increasingly partisan and when you look

at how ken Paxton has used his power it

is hard not to think that that is a bad

thing but partisanship can cut both ways

and now that Trump is in office

democratic state AG's are the ones

filing lawsuits against the president

and while you may have been unhappy to

hear people cheer for that

pistol-packing mama as husband suing

Obama I suspect it may feel a little

different hearing the Democratic AG of

Washington state say this we have 19

since the donald trump became president

we've filed 19 lawsuits against

administration so what do you say to

people who just think you have an axe to

grind against this guy why I plead

guilty

[Laughter]

you see it's interesting how your

feelings on soon the government can

change a lot based on who is saying it

it's like how I'm getting off here is a

fine thing for someone to say if they're

standing next to the door of a train but

a very rude thing to say if they are

masturbating on that same train

so look state AG's have a lot of power

and while many of us may not have been

aware of that corporations and other

special interests certainly have because

both rocker and dagger have been

increasingly aggressive about raising

funds and one way they do that is by

organizing events where they essentially

sell access to AG's ragga

especially has some pretty lavish

getaways where industries can mingle

with the AG's who are supposed to be

policing them as CPS found when it spot

on one in South Carolina we saw at least

nine state AG's rubbing shoulders with

representatives from Koch Industries Big

Tobacco payday lenders and the NRA the

dress code resort casual CBS News

reviewed 88 donations over $50,000 and

found more than half of the donors had

matters under consideration by a state

attorney general or had recently settled

now rocker says there is absolutely no

quid pro quo there so I guess those

groups simply donated substantial

amounts of money because they wanted to

chillax to the max at a resort casual

clambake with North Dakota Attorney

General Wayne Stenehjem oh yeah he's not

just the AG of North Dakota he's the

mayor of margarita blue Wayne

parties hard he's an animal

and look some state AG's have been

ridiculously cozy with corporations take

scott pruett former head of the EPA he

previously served as Oklahoma's AG where

he had a very close relationship with

energy companies he sued the EPA 14

times and wrote the agency multiple

letters about policies that threatened

to impact local oil companies like Devon

Energy but when a reporter obtained

copies of Pruitt's correspondence with

Devon he noticed a weird coincidence the

letters that scott pruett had written

were identical copies in most cases of

draft letters that Devon had sent him he

had taken those letters and simply put

him on a stationery and sentiment as if

they were essentially the state law

enforcement official opinion it was like

holy exactly like he said holy



and that sure looks like Pruitt let an

oil company do his work for him although

to be fair maybe he just happened to

think up the exact same words in the

exact same order that they did maybe you

find that plausible personally I find it

about as plausible as I do the idea that

the family in a quiet place stayed

silent for 472 days Wow no one thought

Eid for more than a year that could

really be the title of the movie because

that is genuinely incredible so so state

AG's are powerful increasingly partisan

and over half of them are on the ballot

this year and Republicans are very much

ready for this fight as Arkansas state

AG and chair of raga Leslie Rutledge

will tell you when it comes to the

Democratic AG's I can't speak to what

they do I know they raise a heck of a

lot less money than the Republican AG's

do because we have been crushing it ok

so first again a bit of a dick move by

the c-span Caravan they're undercutting

her claims of crushing it with a cruel

cut away to her audience candy crushing

it but the fact is she is right Raja is

really out raising dark and it seems

they are now locked in an arms race for

funds which just cannot be the

healthiest way for this system to

operate naughty raga naughty dagger if

you keep keep behaving like that your

parents will tell you to de see which

like your sisters

now interestingly Rutledge is one of the

AG's up for election on November 6th as

is possible pen thief Ken Paxton and if

you live in any of these highlighted

States you have got an Ag race to vote

for and it is really worth taking a few

minutes to research the candidates

especially because many people who do

actually vote end up leaving the AG box

on the ballot empty so your vote for Ag

may technically be even more valuable in

Texas one poll showed that 39% of

registered voters didn't name who that

they would vote for for Ag because they

and I quote haven't thought enough about

it which sounds terrible but that's

actually a cause for genuine hope

because remember that is where Ken

Paxton is running and if there is one

thing sure to damage Ken Paxton's

reputation it's an awareness of Ken

Paxton's reputation so so please before

November 6th just think about your AG

race you can do it you've got nine days

left and I know that we've all been

asked to think about a lot this year

from Supreme Court nominations to gun

control to the energy of Pete Davidson's

penis it's it's been a lot and now I am

adding research your state AG race to

your list but it is honestly worth it

also if you do it you'll frankly be

amazed at the kind of tidbits that you

might find if you live in Wisconsin just

google Brad Schimel $10,000 coins and

you'll learn about how your AG managed

to spend ten grand of taxpayer money on

coins reading K AE D which stands for

his actual personal motto kicking ass

every day if you live in Arkansas Google

Leslie Rutledge karaoke 2016 so you can

see our friend from before absolutely

crushing it on stage

[Music]

wait did that guy just say sing it

Leslie I'm not sure that's encouragement

I think that might be an honest plea

sing it Leslie sing it

don't just drone it a rhythmically and

an inconsistent volume the bands in E

major and you're in H try and bring it

into the known musical universe Leslie

and look if you're in Michigan and even

if you are not please google Bill

Schuette e 1989 video here's their

current AG but he's not actually up for

election because he's running for

governor but it is still worth googling

that so you can watch him creepily

hitting on a woman behind the camera I

would be happy to move closer to the

land anything some things that may not

let you run the camera on admire your

tenacity appreciate your spirit of

Vincent van Gogh Rembrandt Toulouse

Lautrec oh that is rough to watch I

don't know how she got through the

interview without punching him in the

dick

but point here is a point here is taking

just two minutes to research your state

AG is a valuable use of your time and if

you are thinking that you don't have two

minutes you actually do because it's

11:28 right now I'm not saying goodbye

until 11:30 so go to vote for one one

org right now where you can find out if

there is an election in your state and

if so who your AG candidates are

seriously do it now you will not be

missing anything

I promise nothing entertaining is going

to happen for the rest of this show in

fact to help drive you away for the rest

of the broadcast a bagpiper will be

playing Leslie Rutledge's favorite song

she thinks my tractor's sexy take it

away

[Music]

yes

believe it or not these bagpipes make

this song even more unlistenable than it

already is

that is an ungodly noise no disrespect

turn this show off now and research your

AG and if you haven't already been

repelled into action I'll happily add an

accordion into the mix oh yes the sweet

sweet sound of a bagpipe are called into

x2 sounds that come together

what pop-tarts and fish gum two bunks

for what one.org

right now because I promise this just

isn't gonna get any better and don't

push me on this mentally sound

think again don't join me

should be watching this show anymore

[Music]

coming tonight

[Applause]

that we're never going to pay for

charters

[Applause]

how are you somehow the worst

ingredients in all this

energies because these guys are bout to

get louder

[Music]

Public Defenders the only people who

appear in court more frequently than

former child stars even if you have

never come into contact with the public

defender you will know them from their

important cameo in the Miranda warning

speech you have the right to remain

silent you have the right to an attorney

give the right to an attorney give the

right to an attorney you have the right

to an attorney you have the right to an

attorney yes apparently even Garfield

knows he has the right to a public

defender and he's going to need one too

because he just murdered a lasagna and a

person the right to a lawyer is a pillar

of American jurisprudence but it's a

right that we've only had since 1963

when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled

that any person who is too poor to hire

a lawyer cannot be assured a fair trial

unless a lawyer is provided for him it's

an idea so obvious you can't believe

there was ever a time that we didn't

have it like corn on the cob holders

that are shaped like corn on the cobs no

one should ever have had to come up with

those they're essential to the fabric of

American life the problem is our public

defender system is currently massively

overburdened depending on the

jurisdiction anywhere from 60 to 90

percent of criminal defendants need a

publicly funded attorney and the system

is creaking under that weight right now

there are about 20 public defenders

handling up to 250 cases in New Orleans

for example each public defender handles

roughly 350 cases a year

public defenders in Fresno County often

work on a thousand cases a year when

state guidelines say they shouldn't be

doing more than a hundred and fifty

thousand cases in a year that's nearly

three cases per day those are Gerard

Depardieu wine consumption numbers

at breakfast and and with caseloads that

heavy public defenders cannot possibly

prepare an effective defense a study New

Orleans a few years back found that the

city had some part-time defenders who

could only spend an average of seven

minutes per case and that is not long

enough to prepare anything

if I only had seven minutes to prepare

this show I definitely would not be

talking about public defenders right now

I'd be desperately trying to fill time

by listing the Muppets in order of

ability I'll do it now Fozzie first

obviously obviously you go fuzzy first

most attractive thing is a sense of

humor don't you gotta go Ralph

you've got to go role then you know what

I'm going Swedish chef and I'm finishing

up with Sam the Eagle because you know

he's into some freaky business this is

just the beginning of the problems some

places don't even have a public

defender's office and and some counties

just contract cases out in bulk to the

lowest bidder and at its worst this can

result in a system known as meetin and

pleadin where the vast majority of

defendants plead out and never even go

to trial 90 to 95 percent of all

criminal cases state and federal are

resolved by plea bargaining now just

think about that about 95 percent of

criminal cases never make it to trial if

law and order reflected reality their

episodes would be pretty short it

basically just be how does your client

plead guilty your honor and then this

[Music]

and as a viewer you would justifiably

feel cheated by that and look it is easy

not to care about this it's easy to

assume that if someone is being

represented by a public defender

they're probably guilty but many are not

and some only please because they feel

they have no alternative look at her

face Stewart

she was arrested in a drug sweep but

claimed she was innocent she faced a

10-year sentence and was stuck in jail

because she couldn't afford bail

she said her court-appointed lawyer

urged her to take a plea deal and she

will ultimately agreed please will fire

your probation you know just just let me

go home to my kid she admitted to a

crime she denies committing just to

spend time with her children that is

horrifying especially because I would be

willing to commit a crime just to not

have to spend time with any children

they are loud cesspools of bacteria with

nothing interesting to say oh you want

to grow up and be a princess I'll tell

you what happens to princesses actually

google diana + truth do it doo doo Biltz

google it actually now after omer pled

guilty the prosecution's case collapsed

and the other defendants who didn't take

a plea deal had their charges dropped

but oma could not take her plea back so

she had to spend five years on probation

during which she was ineligible for some

form of public assistance and wound up

homeless and that is the problem with a

system that can a lot as little as seven

minutes to helping people make decisions

that can affect you for the rest of your

life our public defender system is

dangerously under-resourced one report

found out that 40% of all county based

public defenders have no investigators

on staff that's 40 percent of lawyers

forced to sit at their desks googling

where to get exonerating evidence and

hitting on feeling lucky

and the offices those desks are in could

potentially lack basic standards of

workplace health and safety tough to do

your job when you're competing with

countless roaches crawling around your

office but that is the work environment

and ordered by employees at Augustus

public defender's office and it's so bad

that the office had to close early today

and this infestation is nothing new

oh it's been going on for four years

that office is getting to a point where

roaches are outnumbering than lawyers

and unless one of those roaches happens

to have a law degree from the University

of Rochester and can help take on some

clients that's going to be a problem as

for New Orleans their public defender's

office has actually put up a

crowdfunding page to help make up their

budget shortfall and it's currently only

raised 19 percent of its goal and look

nobody should be in jail because a

Kickstarter didn't meet its goal if

anything some people should be in jail

because a Kickstarter did reach its goal

like this one for an actual giant

inflatable Lionel Richie head YouTube

gentleman should be locked up all night

long all night all night but despite all

these enormous challenges there are

still some amazing lawyers like Travis

Williams he frames every acquittal and

puts it on his wall but guess where he

puts his losses I'm gonna get the last

name of every case I've lost tattooed on

my back right now it's only five and

hopefully it won't get hopefully I want

to feel my back though that's to go but

since the lot since Elena's going to

wall I decided the losses have to go

somewhere they're going my back but they

don't give me felt he tattoos the names

of the cases he's lost on his back that

is a truly heroic lawyer he's like

Atticus Finch only real and not as it

turns out a horrible racist

screw you Fucci Gulf come knockin Birds

the point is many public defenders do

heroic work despite facing overwhelming

institutional obstacles including this

incredible incident involving a Florida

judge not pissing me off

just sit down I'll take care of I don't

need your help right to be here if you

want to fight let's go out back and I'll

just look around

that is clearly a disgrace although I

will say folks like that would make jury

duty a lot more interesting Your Honor

we have reached a verdict we find the

proceedings to be fling awesome

incidentally that judge returned to the

courtroom and called seven cases without

the public defender being present and

he's still on the bench and look a bad

judge can come and go as the head of

programming at NBC will tell you but

access to a lawyer is supposed to be a

constitutional right and it is

increasingly under threat

for instance in four states you can make

so little that you qualify for food

stamps but still not be poor enough to

get state-funded representation and in

at least 43 states you can be billed for

a public defender meaning in these

states we have a system where

conceivably you if you cannot afford an

attorney one will be provided for you

provided that you pay that attorney

which is absurd you can't tell people

something's free and then charge them

for it this is the American judicial

system not candy crush and and for what

this can look like on a human level meet

Larry Thompson in 2010 he was arrested

in Florida for driving with a revoked

license which was a felony charge

because he'd had multiple driving

violations before Larry was sent to jail

where he applied for a public defender

which in Florida incredibly requires a

fifty dollar application fee he couldn't

afford to pay that or his bail so he was

stuck in jail for 59 days at which point

he gave up and pled no contest to get

out and was released on time served but

in Florida if you use a public defender

and have found guilty even by plea you

then Oh attorneys fees and costs

regardless of your ability to pay so

Larry now old not just the $50 public

defender application fee but also an

extra $100 fee for having used the

public defender and even another fee of

$100 to pay the prosecution's costs

which is like taking like a bully taking

your lunch money and then charging you

an additional lunch money reallocation

fee but they still weren't done on top

of those and other fees for the cry

pled no contest to the court then added

partial payment fees each month for the

next several months

bringing Larry's tab to six hundred and

seventy five dollars and that all brings

us to about a month ago when Larry was

actually arrested for contempt of court

as a result of not paying those fees and

arrests incidentally for which they

charged him a two hundred and ten dollar

administrative fee at this point they

may they may as well have just slapped

on an irony fee for good measure because

it turns out having no money in Florida

can be really expensive or one

more thing when they arrested Larry he

was receiving hospice care for a

terminal pulmonary condition and was so

ill that gel was forced to send him to

the hospital where he was watched by two

guards and chained by his ankles to his

hospital bed luckily he was eventually

released and his debt was paid by donors

who heard his story but he still

understandably could not quite believe

what had just happened to him I never

knew they would actually arrest the

person in my condition well not being

able to claim money because I have a

favorite so I can't see them I keep

arresting the old man over to take me

back to jail it charge me 250 more

dollars that I have to agree to I guess

I'm sitting in jail when I can't get

oxygen in jail like I needed so they dig

me actually an issue in me a distance

none of things makes any sense

it doesn't even make fiscal sense

because the state of Florida did collect

the eight hundred eighty five dollars in

fines that Larry owed them but in doing

that they spent thousands of dollars

needlessly imprisoning him and surely

Florida could have used that money for

something they badly needs like I don't

know rehab programs for meth-addicted

swamp raccoons

I'm assuming accurately but but the

point is 50 years after the Supreme

Court gave everyone the fundamental

right to an attorney even if you can't

afford one we now have a system where

the most vulnerable people are

potentially being charged for access to

a hideously broken system and we either

need to fix that or at the very least

update the Miranda warning in our cop

shows to reflect reality

you have the right to remain silent the

right to remain silent you have the

right to remain silent anything you say

can and will be used against you in a

court of law

you're the light you're an attorney

you're gonna afford an attorney one will

be provided for you I did it alright

we're not done I'm not done I'm not

finished that attorney may have 300

other cases that he or she is working on

that's not a joke literally 300 other

cases potentially have a total of seven

minutes to prepare your defense do i

short seven minutes is no short seven

minutes it Billy Joel's scenes from an

Italian restaurant is 37 seconds longer

and that attorney that attorney that

attorney may be exhausted unable to

think straight the attorney is likely to

be grossly underpaid or working in an

office crawling with cockroaches you

know what really blows that attorney may

pressure you to take a guilty plea

statistically statistically

statistically there's a 90 plus percent

chance that you will take that guilty

plea an attorney may get challenged to a

fight in the hallway by a judge that

guess where I don't know yes

come on guess Florida of course it was

Florida how could it not be fun one more

thing that attorney that is provided for

you may not be free if you lose you may

have to pay them you might even have to

pay the prosecutor is that

constitutional its constitutional as

you piece of

and all this assumes that we can even

pay for that lawyer how's the

Kickstarter campaign doing now do you

understand your rights as I have

explained them to you know what no

basically

you

you

[Music]

voting for adults one of the few

remaining activities for it you still

get a sticker the midterm elections are

just two months away when every citizen

of voting age will have their chance to

be heard even this guy thing is the

category and when you're ready Edgar

fish love this law sorry Edgar but the

category was things are the answer we

were looking for was fish loop it's it's

the thing you use when you want to

a fish facially but a lot next time

Edgar the fact is while that fish pucker

may be able to cast the votes a

surprisingly large amount of people are

barred from doing so it's estimated that

more than six million Americans are

barred from voting because of felony

disenfranchisement laws it's true six

million people are unable to vote

because at some point in their life they

committed a felony that is a lot for

perspective that's like if you took all

the people who bought a copy of Robin

Thicke's divorce opera Paula and then

added almost six million more people

look if any of you are thinking this

point well who really gives a if

convicted felons can't vote you frankly

wouldn't be alone they've committed

crimes are they the best people to judge

some of these laws that are to be passed

would we rather live in a society where

there are no consequences for our

actions I just think that they've done

something wrong so I don't really think

they should be allowed to be voting in

our president and stuff like that oh oh

you don't do you you think if someone

makes a mistake you should follow them

for the rest of their life whether they

were convicted of marijuana possession

or went to brunch dressed like a TJ Maxx

Janis Joplin I get it I get it the fact

here is many lawmakers actually agree

with her here is Mitch McConnell arguing

that keeping felons from voting is a

public safety issue we're talking about

rapists murderers and robbers and even

terrorists or spies do we want to see

convicted terrorists who seek to destroy

this country voting in elections

okay first terrorists are not voting are

they they're all about making giant

violent points that get everyone's

attention not lining up in a public

school gymnasium to write in Isis for

this

school boards and second the most recent

analysis found only 18% of felony

convictions were for violent crimes of

any sort meaning the vast majority were

for nonviolent offenses like property or

drug crimes and for those who have

served their sentence but are still

unable to vote this situation is

understandably frustrating at what point

do we break the cycle at what point are

we able to say hey you know what

I am citizen enough you want me to work

you want me to pay taxes you want me to

make sure I take care of my family but

yeah I can't vote so am i citizen or am

I not a citizen yeah he's got a point

because that man is suffering taxation

without representation and historically

that's been a bit of a sticking point

for America I'm pretty sure I learned

about that in school something about the

American savages through tea into the

water without even having the common

decency to add a splash of milk so so

tonight so tonight let's look at felony

disenfranchisement and one state in

particular because these six million

disenfranchised voters are not evilly

distributed around the country in most

states people with felony convictions

automatically regain their voting rights

at some point but there are a few where

they do not and the worst state of all

concerning this and arguably everything

else is Florida around one and a half

million of its citizens nearly 10% of

its adult population have completed

sentences for felony convictions but

still can't vote and given the

iniquities of our justice system that

burden is disproportionately felt by

african-americans because in Florida

over one in five black adults cannot

vote that is staggering it may be the

dumbest thing about Florida which is

frankly impressive considering stories

like these only in Florida would an

underwear clad man go for a walk in the

rain with his pet goat also if you could

tell there he's um he's playing a

harmonica check out this video showing a

genius steering his motorcycle with his

feet in Jacksonville only in Florida

does a creature this adorable become a

bloodthirsty fur demon all of a sudden

he jumped on the kayak in two seconds

later he jumped on me the viral video

shows Robbie Stratton running through a

convenience store with an alligator in

his hands no wreck

action of that happening at all at all

this store sells a good liquor okay

everything about that guy is absolutely

fascinating but I think I'm most

interested to the fact that he was drunk

at the store where he bought the liquor

so did he buy the liquor leave drinking

fetch an alligator and then returned to

the same store did he drink the liquor

at the store at which point an alligator

walked in or did he get drunk and then

meet a sober alligator was having a bad

day once it have a couple of drinks and

the guy said I know just the place

alligator I don't know the point is it's

Florida all options are equally

plausible here's the thing the fact is

Florida is the disenfranchisement

capital of America so how did that

happen well for starters a post-civil

war changed their constitution stripped

all convicted felons of their voting

rights for life

and while Florida's governor can restore

those rights the current one Rick Scott

seen here auditioning for the role of

happy pencil in all my nightmares he has

made this process much more difficult

because what the governor before him

made regaining voting rights close to

automatic for many nonviolent offenses

Scott implemented a system where you

have to wait five to seven years just to

apply to get your vote back then submit

an application then wait more then in

many cases have to travel to Tallahassee

which no one should ever have to do

under any circumstances to argue your

case in person these obstacles are

ridiculous and unnecessary and this is

how Scott justified them look if you if

you are a convicted felon and part of

what you did you lost your rights and so

you ought to you know there ought to be

a process if you're gonna get those

rights back and I think it's fair to the

rest of the citizens of the state and

it's they'll see a process that they

didn't they know will work right except

there is a process for paying your debt

to society and getting your rights back

it's called

serving your sentence you're

just tagging on at the end it's

like someone finishing a triathlon and

we can start to then say no it's a

quarter con now you have to learn manual

it doesn't really seem fair and and it's

honestly worth taking a look at this

process because it's absolutely insane

applications are judged by a clemency

board made up of Rick Scott and members

of his cabinet seen here looking like

the only local news team that you

somehow know aren't each other

and and if you do end up in front of me

you're given ten minutes to prove that

you have turned your life around

they then question you before making a

decision that seems completely arbitrary

and it seems that way because it is

Scott begins meetings by making that pre

fully clear this is a board of clemency

okay we there's no law we're following

the law are been followed by the judges

so we get to make our decisions based on

our own beliefs there's no standards

each of us have the right opportunity

make a decision the way based on what we

believe this is this is a court of mercy

it's not a court in this if there's no

when if you walk up and say I deserve

something that's not how this works

we this there's no there's absolutely no

standards so we can make any decisions

we want you know I'm sure that's true

it's just weird to hear it set out loud

in the same way that would be weird to

give the CEO of Kraft say we don't

actually know what Velveeta is it fell

from space in the 1950s and it's been

spawning in a lab ever since before we

package it we take out the teeth and ice

but we're starting to think it might

make it angry and look because there are

no formal standards the committee can

decide what's important and can focus on

things as petty as moving violations

what we're trying to figure out is is

that have people change their lives

right right that's so so getting traffic

tickets all the time so if you sit up

here your first reaction as well do they

really respect the law right right I

mean that might be your first reaction

to be honest my first reaction is why

rick scott's glass is not near the eyes

part of his head and how have they not

fallen off his nose by now

it is not just your driving record under

scrutiny your personal life is very much

on the table and one board member

Florida CFO Jimmy Patronus seems to have

a specific idea of where that personal

life should be conducted because there

is one question that he asks a lot y'all

go to church you go to church you go to

church together

ma'am where do y'all go to church go

Church and go to church do you go to

church now if the answer to that

question is important that is up

and if it's not why are you constantly

asking it either you are factoring

religious habit into your evaluation of

whether someone should be able to vote

or you're making a list of people's

houses that would be easy to rob on a

Sunday morning and neither is a good use

of the panel's time and once you've

jumped through all of these hoops your

fate is in the hands of a panel who do

not have to explain their reasoning to

you just watch Leon Gillis he had served

time for robbery and drug convictions

but had been clean for eight years and

was running a drug rehab program when he

made his case to the board in 2011 Rick

Scott actually commended him for the

progress that he'd made and then said

this so at this point I'm gonna deny in

restoration of civil rights and can I

answer your question yes sir

how long is there I'm not sure and you

know I think every key every case is

different if I'm doing everything I'm

supposed to do and I'm trying and I'm

making sure that I do the right thing

I'm supposed to do then how long am I

supposed to wait I can tell you that in

that answer but if today and not I don't

feel comfortable doing it okay thank you

and that was it he refused to restore

someone's civil rights without

demonstrating much more of a reason than

I don't know I guess I'm just not

feeling it right now and the thing is

even if this process was perfect which

it is not it can't handle the volume

that the panel only makes meets four

times a year and there are too many

cases for them to review also while

Scott's predecessor restored the Voting

Rights of over one hundred and fifty

five thousand people in his four-year

term Scott is only averaging around 400

a year and that is meaningful especially

in a state where elections tend to have

very narrow margins Trump only won

Florida by a hundred thousand

folks and President Bush famously won it

by just 537 but there are actually

there's actually some genuinely good

news here Florida has a chance to fix

this a real chance there was a

constitutional amendment on their ballot

this November

that would bring Florida in line with

many other states if it passes people

with felony convictions except in the

cases of murder or sex crimes would get

the right to vote after completing their

sentence that could give as many as 1.4

million people the right to vote but it

is by no means a foregone conclusion the

amendment needs a 60% majority to pass

so if it's okay with everybody I would

like to speak directly to the people of

Florida for a second

hi there Florida let's let's try to get

comfortable with each other shall we

I know that we make I know that we make

fun fun of you a lot Florida because of

all the stupid things that happen where

you live and you'll probably expected me

to steer away from all that and appeal

to your innate goodness and sense of

reason but I'm not going to do that

instead

I'd like to Double Down and suggest that

it's precisely because of all that

glorious stupidity that you should

innately appreciate the value of second

chances I mean come on Florida your

Florida a state that's seen the

headlines Florida restaurant no longer

allows monkey Mondays after animal bit

eight-year-old boy and Florida besties

allottee law does not ban oral sex with

animals and Florida gas station dropped

suspect appeared to have drawn on beards

which I would say is probably true given

that this was the beard and yes yes

Floridians you do make mistakes but it's

also in your nature to help one another

recover as you can tell from the

headline Good Samaritan helps Florida

man who accidentally shot himself in the

penis you can't throw for each other

even this song your state song speaks to

your ability to screw up and bounce back

the original lyrics did this have to be

changed because they were too racist and

somehow it still sounds racist today

even in instrumental form the point here

is there's November Florida you have got

a real chance to remedy a mistake and do

something genuinely good for over a

million of your citizens so please on

November 6th for one day just one day

don't take your goat for a walk in your

underwear stay away from any bitey

otters draw a fake beard on yourself and

go cast a vote on behalf of all your

fellow Floridians who are unable to

please do it Cheers Florida Cheers

[Music]

you

you

tonight this entire show is basically

going to be one long recap of one very

long week and and one event in

particular meaning that sadly there's

going to be no time to talk about Trump

insisting that the UN was laughing with

him at him which it absolutely wasn't

nor is that going to be time to tell me

- what was clearly the most fun story of

the week this well the Philadelphia

Flyers having a mascot fans are saying

what that's 7-foot talk ready

Brittany unveiled today in front of

group of kids probably scarred for life

yeah yeah those kids should be scarred

for life

gritty is horrific every single

photo of him is appalling I mean look at

this one that is a nightmare how about

this one

that is simply psychotic Griff he looks

like the end result of the orange

McDonald's fry guy hooking up with

grimace and we've been over this a

million times before on this show if

you're a McDonald's mascot you do not

have sex with another McDonald's mascot

new genetics are too similar and their

kids always turn out winners

very very weird incidentally it's not

like gritty has any business being a

hockey mascot apparently he hasn't

really figured out the navigate on the

ice yet he felled multiple times in his

debut last night the Pittsburgh Penguins

tweeting lol okay - which really

responded sleep with one eye open

tonight bird

holy gritty calm down they're just

engaging in some inter team banter and

you've gone straight to I will murder

you in your sleep

and look there is absolutely nothing

that I would love to do more tonight

than then talk about gritty all night

long from the fact that he's already

done a Kim Kardashian style photo shoot

to the fact that and this is true

someone has already got an actual tattoo

of him on their body interestingly that

someone Jimmy Carter

unfortunately though the fun we just had

must now stop because instead we need to

talk about Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court

nominee and walking crushed be occur on

Thursday

Christine glossy Ford who was a cute

governor of sexually assaulting her in

1982 came before the Senate Judiciary

Committee to deliver some powerful

testimony I am here today not because I

want to be I am terrified I am here

because I believe it is my civic duty to

tell you what happened to me

while Brett Cavanaugh and I were in high

school right and she did just that

describing in deep detail her

recollection of how a drunk Kavanagh

pinned her down tried to remove her

clothing and put his hand over her mouth

which he tried to scream she insisted

that this could not possibly be a case

of mistaken identity

because she was a hundred percent

certain that it was him and after her

opening statement

she don't took questions which sometimes

took an odd turn like when the

prosecutor to whom the Republicans had

outsourced their responsibilities seized

on a polygraph test that Ford had passed

did you pay for the polygraph yourself I

don't think so

okay do you know who did pay for the

polygraph not yet no I believe you said

it hasn't been paid for yet is that

correct

let me put an end to this mystery her

lawyers have paid for her polygraph

as his routine as his routine don't you

try and brush her question aside she

just cracked this case wide open

she found the missing piece of the

puzzle specifically a puzzle that reads

who cares thoughts testimony was

brave and compelling and seemed to

affect many on the committee including

Republican senator Orrin Hatch who chose

to express his admiration in a far from

ideal way and he found dr. Ford credible

pleasing you should not use the word

pleasing to describe a sexual assault

survivor painfully recounting one of the

worst moments of her life you honestly

shouldn't really use it to describe

anything maybe maybe watching milk mix

into your coffee except you know what

not even then because the moment you say

watching this milk is pleasing you come

off like a creep who's waiting for

everyone to leave the room so he can

his coffee the point is by

lunchtime on Thursday it honestly seemed

that Cavanaugh's nomination could be

finished even Fox News was implying as

much this was extremely emotional

extremely raw and extremely credible and

nobody could listen to her deliver those

words and talk about the assault and the

impact it had had on his life in her

life and not have the her heart go your

heart go out to her this is a disaster

for the Republicans that is Fox News

calling Ford's testimony a disaster for

the Republicans and not like one of

those Puerto Rico disasters you know

this time one they might actually care

about but then

then came Cavanaugh testimony and it is

worth looking at it in detail tonight

because in every regard it could not

have been more different from fours a

for starters while she was remarkably

composed in discussing traumatic details

Cavanaugh came straight out of the gates

weird in his opening statement not just

denying all her allegations but almost

breaking down while attempting to paint

a folksy image of his time in high

school I worked out with other guys at

Toby's house he was the great

quarterback on our football team and his

dad ran workouts yeah he's crying at the

memory of lifting weights at his friend

Tobin's house I hate to say it but I'm

starting to think that men might be too

emotional for the super alien corpse

he'd be really pretty if he just smiled

more and it wasn't just memories of a

high school quarterback that was making

him tear up I've always had a lot of

close female friends I remember talking

almost every night it seemed to my

friends ami or Julie or Kristen for

Karen the Suzanne or Maura or Megan or

Nikki the list goes on okay

that's not testimony though is it that

is a plaintive spoken word cover of

Mambo number five

ramallah sandra and rita and as i

continue you know they're getting

sweeter but when Cavanaugh was not

choking back to use he was starting to

get noticeably angry arguing that he was

the victim of a giant conspiracy this

allegation was Unleashed and publicly

deployed over dr. Ford's wishes and then

and then as no doubt was expected if not

planned came a long series of false

last-minute smears designed to scare me

and drive me out of the process before

any hearing occurred crazy stuff gangs

illegitimate children fights on boats in

Rhode Island I mean come on do I seem

like exactly the type of person who

would get into a fight on a boat in

Rhode Island

seriously you tell me when you picture a

fight on a boat in Rhode Island

do you just picture two of me yelling at

each other and exactly this pitch and

volume is that what you say but if you

wanted my hair cut you would tell your

father to give you the fight on a boat

in Rhode Island I would like to see you

say that to my face on a boat in Rhode

Island and that's all I have to shout

about that you

[Applause]

remember what you've just seen was him

reading from a prepared statement it got

even stranger once he started taking

questions did you consume alcohol during

your high school years yes we drank beer

my friends and I the boys and girls yes

we drank the air

I liked beer still liked beer we drank

beer the drinking age as I know it was

18 so the seniors were legal senior year

in high school people were illegal to

drink and we drink yeah we drank beer

and I said sometimes sometimes probably

had too many beers and sometimes other

people had too many beers

we drank beer we liked beer yeah I get

that I do I am I get that loud and clear

Bret's but but the question isn't really

do you like beer is it it's how much do

you like it just like how the question

in Jeffrey Dahmer's trial wasn't do you

like people it was do you like people to

a really problematic extent and when

pressed on his drinking Kavanagh became

either dismissive or outright hostile

and it was at those moments you got a

real sense of who this man actually is

what do you consider to be too many

beers I don't know

you know we whatever the chart says I

like beer I don't know if you like beer

senator um what do you like the next one

is Senator what are you oh you're saying

there's never been a case where you

drank so much that you didn't remember

what happened the night before or part

of what happened that's you're asking

about yeah blackout I don't know have

you

could you answer the question judge I

just so you that's not happened is that

your answer

yeah and I'm curious if you have okay so

first aside from being deeply

disrespectful have you is just dot the

answer of an innocent person if you ask

someone if they ever blew a dog and they

go I don't know of you that person blew

a dog he blew a dog in in all

likelihood not just one either and that

surly tone was emblematic of Cavanaugh's

demeanor throughout the hearing not the

tone of a man who hopes to one day have

the honor of serving on the Supreme

Court but the tone of someone who feels

entitled to be honest and frankly can't

believe that you're being such a dick

about this and that actually does make

some sense because this is a man who has

had every imaginable advantage his elite

high school and this is true has its own

nine hole golf course now am i saying

that someone who went to a school with

its own golf course should not be on the

Supreme Court yeah yeah I think I am but

here we are I'm gonna stand by it but

the catalogue didn't just rely on

belligerence to refute Ford's charges he

brought evidence specifically a calendar

from 1982

about which he was and I know this will

shock you weirdly emotional why did I

keep calendars my dad started to keeping

detailed calendars of his life in 1978

he did so is both a calendar and a diary

Christmastime we sit around and he ails

us with old stories old milestones or

weddings old events from his calendars I

know that it may seem cruel to make fun

of a man crying over his late father's

calendars but what if I were to tell you

that his father is still alive

and was sitting right behind him and

that is why I am now completely

comfortable saying that every Christmas

we'd gather round and dad would

regardless with old events from his

calendar is the single weirdest

thing I've ever heard anybody say

Cavanaugh Jeb said his dad started

keeping calendars in 1978 when Cavanaugh

was 13 meaning he would have been 14 at

the time his dad had even a single

calendar to read to his children fraud

and an adult man reading last year's

calendar to his 14 year old son is

literally the saddest Christmas I could

imagine other than being one of the

innocent people who gets murdered in the

movie die heart that is literally the

only other example and the truth is

Cavanaugh's calendar may not have

actually helped him because while he

told the panel he never attended a

gathering like the one dr. Ford

describes in her allegation in fact his

calendar shows at least one similar

events with at least two of the people

Ford named in her letter and Cavanaugh

misrepresenting the truth actually

became something of a really troubling

pattern for instance he repeatedly made

this strong claim to poke holes in Ford

story I just want to emphasize all four

witnesses who are allegedly at the event

have said it didn't happen including dr.

Ford's longtime friend miss Kaiser

except this 53 year old frat pledge is

actually significantly mistaking the

facts there because in reality three of

those people merely said that they

didn't recall the party as described and

Ford's friend miss Kaiser did

specifically say she believes Ford's

allegation and the fourth person there

is Cavanaugh himself so Cavanaugh just

wildly mischaracterized evidence and

that is one thing a judge really

no not to do is basically that and don't

tuck your robes into your blue jeans

because it's objectively a bad look then

there no was the fact that for all of

cabin last talk of his wholesome teenage

years spent respecting women for their

friendships and doing sick reps and

Tobin's dad's house his high school

yearbook tells a very different story

for instance he and his bro friends brag

about be Renata alumni referring to a

girl that they knew now Kavanagh claims

that that was completely asexual and

just clumsily intended to show affection

and that this she was one of us which is

a little hard to believe given that a

Renata only just found out about it and

said the insinuation is horrible hurtful

and simply untrue and P if it was just

affection for a friend where's the

Alumni Society for Amy or Julie or

Kristen or Karen or more especially

[Applause]

Cavanaugh had similarly implausible

explanations for other terms in the

yearbook specifically those commonly

associated with drinking or sex have you

I don't know if it's buffed or boofed

how do you pronounce that Jai refers to

flatulence we were 16 let's look at

beach week

Ralph's Club biggest contributor what

does the word Ralph mean in that that

probably refers to throwing up I'm known

to have a weak stomach and I always have

devil's triangle drinking game

the term devil's triangle is commonly

known to refer to a threesome involving

two men and one woman so I'm just not

buying that unless all your drinking

games were named after widely recognized

sex acts Oh doggy style drinking game

you pour vodka in a bowl and you lap it

up while wearing only a dog collar a

fist thing drinking game that's gripping

a Shiraz in each fist and toasting the

progress of feminism

sixty-nining absolutely drinking game

that's listening to Bryan Adams hit song

summer of 69 while uneventfully drinking

a beer on the porch even c-span callers

we're not buying this whole drinking

game defense

go ahead Carl hi I just wanted to echo a

few things that another color said which

is that a devil's triangle is certainly

not a drinking game it's an encounter

with two men and a woman bloody well go

next to Mary in Bronxville New York I

like to imagine that that guy calls in

every day to describe what a Devil's

Triangle is and that was the only day he

stood even a chance of getting all the

way through his explanation well it may

seem unbelievably petty to give this

much attention to our high schoolers

yearbook you have to remember that to

some extent many were watching this

hearing to try and ascertain who was

more trustworthy was it the terrified

psychology professor who blew up her

entire life to relive her trauma on a

national stage or was it

Judge animal house who seemed to be

sweating making up drinking games before

members of the Senate and yet for some

senators cavernous poor performance was

completely immaterial as they had

already made up their mind Orrin Hatch

taking a break from being pleased made

the broad case that it was ridiculous to

even ask questions about an events that

took place such a long time ago

this is a national disgrace the way

you're being treated

there's been no whisper of misconduct by

him at a time he's been a judge what we

have are uncorroborated unsubstantiated

claims from his teenage years now that

is clearly a shitty disingenuous

argument though although I will give

hatch credit for invoking the phrase

teenage years with the voice of a

thirteen-year-old whose balls are

literally dropping mid-sentence now as

for Lindsey Graham he turned his

performative disgust at the process up

to 10 this is the most unethical sham

since I've been in politics and if you

really wanted to know the truth you sure

as hell wouldn't have done what you've

done to this guy

you're looking for a fair process you

came to the wrong town at the wrong time

my friend okay first of all Lindsey

Graham sounds like the least

intimidating sheriff in the entire Wild

West you turned back around and get back

on your horse mr. meyen is what you're

looking at is the soft tender little

baby face of justice you came to the

wrong town at the wrong get on your

horse look second Lindsey Graham is not

actually wrong there he looks like a dog

that's not allowed to be within 50 feet

of a playground but he is not

technically wrong this process was

deeply flawed but that is because he and

the Republican majority designed it that

way if they wanted to avoid a he-said

she-said situation they absolutely could

have but it said they only called two

people so we only heard what he said and

what she said a much fairer process

would have involved gathering evidence

and hearing from others like Cavanaugh's

classmates in particular his high school

friend mark judge who forged says was in

the room during the alleged assault but

that is not how Republicans chose to set

up the hearing and fall Cavanaugh's

emotional appeals about wanting his name

cleared he was repeatedly asked about

whether he supported an FBI

investigation and he consistently dodged

the question judge Cavanaugh will you

support an FBI investigation right now I

I will do whatever the committee wants

to personally do you think that's the

best thing for us to do you won't answer

look senator I've said I wanted a

hearing and I'd said I was welcome

anything you'll welcome

anything just say you will support an

investigation you've been accused of a

heinous crime that you insist you did

not commit if I will Cavanaugh I would

be desperately trying to prove my

innocence in every possible way FBI

investigations polygraph tests sworn

affidavits from not only mark judge but

also all my other boys from g-town prep

I'm talking about Tobin Timmy squee PJ

come rug Chuck smirk see dubs dirty Pete

fat Andy Swift of the horndog bow

nowit's boner which his older brother

Jay money and dick you know you

know character witnesses look at this

point let's actually pull back and look

at the picture of Cavanaugh's character

that we now have because even if you

don't think he's guilty of sexual

assault or even if you think that it's

impossible to say whether he is because

it happened in his teenage years even

then there should be plenty in what we

saw this week - cause you real concern

because a key part of the job that he is

up for is judgment and temperament and

this week we saw Cavanaugh talk over the

top of Senators dodged questions and

conflate doesn't recall something

happening with denies something happened

which is again a important

distinction for a judge not to mention

he repeatedly wept at the concept of

calendars and there was one more

important moment that I would argue is

disqualifying in and of itself because

ideally a Supreme Court justice should

make decisions independent of politics

Cavanaugh himself has stated the court

must never be viewed as a part as an

institution and he is right about that

and yet in his opening statement a

document he had time to draft and

consider his tone was positively

trumpian this whole two-week effort has

been a calculated and orchestrated

political hit fueled with a parent

pent-up anger about President Trump and

the 2016 election fear that has been

unfairly stoked about my judicial record

revenge on behalf of the Clintons and

millions of dollars in money from

outside left-wing opposition groups now

that is absolutely horrifying and it is

worth taking him home right now to note

the norm that has just been shattered

because I know that we're all basically

calloused so people talking that way now

but we are supposed to have at least

nine people left in America who do not

talk that way and yet Cavanaugh just all

but came out and said that he's going to

approach his entire tenure as one giant

case of me versus the Lib tard

Cox

and this this brings me to the most

basic question that remains why why this

particular asshole what is he the hill

that conservatives are willing to die on

and I do know that for some of

Cavanaugh's most ardent supporters this

is a purely ideological issue senators

may not say it out loud but this woman

for Cavanaugh did being a gets in

personally as I went abortion to stop

even if it turns out he's guilty I think

I'm still gonna support him and I hope

he gets in because this could be a good

chance to overturn abortion okay so it's

fine it's fine to appoint someone who

has committed sexual assault to the

Supreme Court as long as they will

curtail abortion rights it's a starts

that prioritizes human lives as long as

you think life begins at conception

stops right before a sexual assault and

then starts right back up again

as soon as that assault is over now

obviously obviously I personally do not

agree with that

but even if ending legal abortion is

your ultimate goal

there are many conservative judges who

could deliver that to you without all of

Cavanaugh's issues because purely as a

judge there is nothing unique about

Kavanagh nothing he's not uniquely

qualified Trump reportedly picked him

from a list of 25 names provided by

outside groups like The Federalist

Society whose executive vice president

explicitly pointed out he had no

preference regarding the list is there a

leading contender for you no there's not

really not no it's the list is really

good they're not in order

you're just saying no no no you can

throw a dart at that list and in my view

you'd be fine Wow he answered that

question about Supreme Court justices

like he was just asked which pickle in a

jar

it's his favorite pickle I don't know

man they're all pickles it's a pickle

jar so if it's in this jar it's a

pic

but for some reason the Republican

leadership is continuing to push Cavan

our heart in fact on Friday Lindsey

Graham seem to view Kavanagh with even

more relish I've never felt better

about him being on the bench than I do

right now really you feel better now

than before Cavanaugh testified do you

really mean that or are you afraid that

if you don't say it cabin art will

challenge you to a fight on a boat in

Rhode Island because I do get that he

seems like the type the point is after

all of this I genuinely cannot see a

single good reason for pushing Cavanaugh

over a replacement candidate because you

know deep down any judge they choose is

almost certainly going to restrict

abortion rights you don't need to choose

an unhinged partisan with multiple

accusations of sexual misconduct hanging

over him so it feels like they're doing

this just to deliver a you to

Democrats and even more directly a

you to women because when this when this

week began the biggest fear for many was

that the committee would not believe

Christine Blasi Ford but by the time the

week ended it seemed that something

darker might have happened because it

seemed that response was oh we believe

you we just don't care and the tragic

thing is she knew this was a possibility

she said so explicitly during her

testimony once he was selected and it

seemed like he was popular and that was

a sure vote I was calculating daily the

the risk benefit for me of coming

forward and wondering whether I would

just be jumping in front of a train that

was headed to where it was headed anyway

and that I would just be personally

annihilated she knew publicly reliving

the most traumatic event of her life

could have absolutely no effect on

anything and yet she spoke up anyway it

is absolutely incredible the lengths

that some people will go to for a free

polygraph test look

look look here's the thing here's the

thing I am I am not saying that this is

a done deal just yet they were

desperately pushing Cavanaugh through on

Friday only for extraordinary pressure

to force the reopening of the FBI

investigation which by the way may well

end up being so limited as to be

essentially pointless but the fact is

only continued pressure has even the

slightest chance of stopping Cavanaugh's

confirmation and if he does as seems

increasingly likely make his way to the

court we should never forget how that

happened all what he represents we

certainly will not forget it on this

show you may know that for years we've

had an all dog Supreme Court with dogs

playing the justices from Samuel Alito

to Ruth Bader Ginsburg right good dog

good dog dunk die good dog good dog

sit sit and don't die now now now since

2017 it's actually been a mostly dog

Supreme Court because kneel course hich

is represented on it's by a lobster and

that's because his seat was stolen from

Merrick Garland's there for like a

lobster he does not belong there but

Cavanaugh Cavanaugh if he is seated

doesn't even deserve that treatment he

deserves something that constantly

reminds people who he is something

hostile consistently UPS unsettling

temperamentally unpleasant and that

screams who the allowed this to

happen so I pray that we will not have

to use this but if we do I see no more

fitting embodiment of Cavanaugh than

this

[Music]

yes that's right

just actual Supreme Court

have to deal with Cavanaugh animal

Supreme Court should not have to deal

with this new tainted carpet swatch that

appears to be tweaking on bath socks

I truly hope it does not come to this

and look there is still a chance that we

can stop it so please call your senators

tomorrow and tell them you do not want

to be looking at this for the next 30

years 10 off the bench

you're not even confirmed yet no I don't

want a beer

I don't want to be in your big weirdo

get off that bench you entitled monster

you

fatal we're so used to it it has become

a fixture of American life down here too

short one minute you got three girls in

the jacuzzi

next minute somebody's in jail and you

have to bail them out that's what

happens down into short

the other thing that happens down at the

shore

chlamydia just a medically astounding

rate of chlamydia and it's heart

America's bail system sounds pretty

simple if you're charged with a crime

the court might ask for an amount of

money as bond and then return it to you

once you show up for trial and if you

have that money it's no big deal but if

you don't you can be in big trouble just

look at one example a man called nig

well he was arrested for driving with a

suspended license the court set bail at

$1,000 and he had a choice pay it all

await a trial in Rikers Island I don't

let me well and his wife take the story

from there a wooden bush Rikers on my

worst enemy

cuz it's rough it was hard and it's a

bomb I had to try to borrow money from

this person and this person and this

person should try to get him out he told

the judge I can't afford a thousand

dollar bail so he really didn't have a

choice but to plead guilty now whether

he was guilty or not the fact is a

non-violent offender spent time in

Rikers because he didn't have a thousand

dollars and this is a systemic problem

increasingly bail has become a way to

lock up the poor regardless of guilt

because we go Nick what was a family man

who posed no danger to society

whatsoever and he was stuck in Rikers

whereas millionaire Robert Durst who'd

been accused of murder in Texas had a

completely different experience at the

bail system I had been told by the

detective that you've been charged with

murder bail has been set at 250 thousand

dollars but was your intention when you

put up the $250,000 to run away Oh

goodbye $250,000 goodbye Jail I'm out

I'm out

that of course is an excerpt from robert

durst children's books

goodbye jail goodbye money

goodbye bail I killed them all but

goodbye jail of course of course

the problem is the frequency and cost of

bail have risen dramatically and it is

disproportionately hurting the poor in

fact in 2013 an analysis of New Jersey's

jail population found that nearly 40%

were being held solely because they

couldn't meet the terms of their bail

which is crazy jail is supposed to be

for dangerous criminals in 40% of a

group don't meet the basic criteria to

be there that should change your

perception of what that group is if 40%

of the Girl Scouts were grown men you

feel weird about buying cookies from

them so so what happens if you can't

make bail well much like a game of marry

kill with crosby Stills and Nash there

are a few terrible scenarios

option one you sit in jail and again if

you're poor as this defense attorney

explains that has immediate consequences

our clients work at jobs where if you're

absent you're fired

our clients live in shelters or in

transitional housing places where if

you're not there for the night your

place is gone so there are a lot of

different ways in which incarceration

even for a short period of time can

really destroy someone's life

exactly jail can do for your actual life

what being in a marching band can do for

your social life even if you're just in

for a little while it could destroy you

destroy that many defendants who can't

afford bail favor option number two

simply pleading guilty even if you're

not as a former public defender explains

you sit in jail because you can't afford

to pay your way to freedom and you're

often confronted with a deal that goes

like this plead guilty get out maintain

your innocence and go to trial stay in

and poor people are regularly choosing

to admit guilt just to get out of there

which isn't good the only time that's

appropriate is in a Catholic

confessional what what do you mean is

there anything else I don't know I

masturbated into a kiwi fruit is that

what you're they just let me leave I

have stuff to do

and the problem is if you do plead

guilty to a crime you didn't commit that

has its own downsides because

unfortunately on a job application next

to the question have you ever been

convicted of a crime check yes or no

most don't then leave four pages of

blank space to explain the social and

economic inequalities inherent in the

legal system and that brings us to your

final option commercial bail bondsmen

you know the people who make amazing ads

like these ruffies bail bonds has busted

out all over Middle Tennessee I ain't

going out like this

Oh my culprit bill balls cuz they got

calling me Miriam Jesus break bail bonds

for 10:00 to 9:00 to 302 that you're

locked up in the frame yes

well I will say it is a little weird

given that Jesus pretty memorably I

think was not bails out I mean he did

eventually escaped custody but it was a

real workaround of the system here here

is how that system works no bail

bondsmen promised the court to pay your

bail if you fail to show up for a trial

in exchange you pay them 10 to 15% of

the bail amount which they then keep

regardless of how your trial goes so if

your bail is $5,000 and you're found

innocent then you've basically just paid

a 750 dollar fee to a bondsman for doing

absolutely nothing wrong and paying $750

for absolutely nothing should be

reserved for one thing and one thing

only

six-month gym memberships that's it

you're not going to use it Gerald you're

gonna use the treadmill twice and that's

it this is learning to speak Korean all

over again - and if you don't show up

for your trial bail bondsman routinely

hire bounty hunters to track you down

and they have a frightening amount of

power in all but four states the

companies are legally allowed to take

almost any measure necessary to capture

a client including crossing state lines

and breaking into homes it's a dangerous

business for everyone involved with few

rules and little oversight oh they're

not kidding in 18 states anyone can

become a bounty hunter regardless of

education training or prior criminal

history becoming a bounty hunter is

basically a lot like becoming a social

media expert all it takes is want to get

bad enough and not caring about whether

strangers hate you or not

but but then the news that any idiot can

be a bounty hunter shouldn't really be

that surprising to you if you've ever

turned on A&E and stumbled across at

this I am along

Oh God when I say they know what I'm

saying

[Music]

the only way this guy will get away from

us is if it kills himself right now

and jumps into a pool of sharks okay

okay I hate to be a stickler over

chronology dawg

but how do you kill yourself and then

jump into a pool of sharks but that's

the kind of attention to detail job that

makes me worry about you operating as an

unregulated vigilante now that show was

so popular inspired pretty much every

other Bale business to pitch themselves

as a reality show just click around

online and you will find sizzle reels

for a veritable smorgasbord of similar

shows we're coming to get you the

natural high you got to think like I do

you like that and we get quicker than

that you want tough you want action meet

big Benning they call it a teddy bear

Denyce huntress it doesn't stop there

there's also Richard the screwdriver

Richard out the other Richard Alison the

greco-roman wrestler Caroline the one

who took up archery after watching The

Hunger Games and don't forget Jennifer

the arthritic alpaca in a bowler hats

actually you know what I now regret

making fun of that now that I'm seeing

the cast I get the appeal I want to see

those characters grow clearly these

shows are in a competitive marketplace

and the problem is when people try to

stick out ideas like this happen

so what do we do differently we don't

just gonna hurt without this each week

two new teams about waters

[Music]

go head-to-head welcome to the most

dangerous competition on television

belches okay first of all first of all

the most dangerous competition on

television is the Bachelorette those

women have left and they've lost lovers

are awarded but it's also a risk it's a

risk she's put herself on the line she's

there for the right reasons and second

it says something about how comfortable

we all are with how our bail system

works that a TV show where people with

guns hunt humans for sport seems

legitimate because we just think well

they're just doing their actual job and

when you give bounty hunters this kind

of power bad things happen

veteran Jean Travis says he was sitting

with his wife on his Bethpage front

porch next thing he knows his barn is

being searched and Travis has a stun gun

pointed at his back the intruders mark

Drummond and his wife Angela bounty

hunters who police say had the wrong

home clay was shot by one of the

bondsman

he was then transported to Ermac where

he died was a bounty hunter justified in

tasing a Midwest City homeowner last

Saturday was another justified in

shooting his dog police say the

videotape they took says no yeah the

video says no basic human decency says

no even a magic 8-ball having seen that

with saying holy I can't believe

you're even asking me

our current bail system makes no sense

and it does a lot of harm and the

frustrating thing is we've known this

for a long time just watch this TV news

special from 1964 yes the jails are

bursting at the seams a problem of great

concern to New York City Commissioner of

Correction and across remaining in jail

because you can't get bail is really

being punished before you're even found

guilty as far as I was concerned that

was not just that was destroying our

concept of justice that's right

this problem has been obvious since it

was considered okay to wear a

wastebasket on your head

look here's here's the good news there

is a better way and it's already in use

in our federal courts and in Washington

DC judges in Washington are allowed to

set money bail only if the defendant can

afford it the results have been far

fewer people spending time behind bars

we are the only city in America where

tonight at our Jail there is not a

single man or woman who is sitting

because they don't have the money to

meet their money back and it's a

testament it's a testament to the state

of our justice system that that

qualifies as bragging because that

should be the norm

he's like a bus driver showing up at

school saying 23 kids picked up 23 kids

dropped off I pitched a perfect game

pretrial services works like this after

you're arrested specialists assess if

you if you're dangerous or a flight risk

if a judge decides that you're not you

can go home and they may monitor you

with things like drug tests or ankle

monitors they even call you to remind

you of your court date it's a system

built on interviews pre-arranged

appearances and trusts much like

Scientology marriages only in this case

much more effective and pretrial service

programs have succeeded around the

country in places ranging from Oregon to

Florida and it is a truly frightening

state of affairs when Florida is a model

for progressive change it shouldn't be a

judicial example for anything did you

know by the way that under Florida law

if you possess all the 5 grams of meth

you can marry it that's a fact that's a

legal fact that's an actual photo that

ran in a newspapers wedding section in

Florida and yet and yet even counties in

Florida recognized our money bail system

is broken and not only is pretrial

services better it's cheaper a recent

assessment of one system showed it

costing only 1/10 as much as keeping

someone locked up which makes sense

because

calling someone to check in costs

virtually nothing this message brought

you by your mother your mother

she brought you into this world and we

got to your king bollocks once in a

while so if pretrial services are fair

up better and cheaper why aren't we all

using it or maybe because thanks to

reality shows we think that this is what

justice looks like we're gonna hunt this

gun down bad dog so so maybe we just

need a new kind of reality show to get

us used to the alternative you want up

you want action meet Steve Carr

he's one of the most respected pretrial

services caseworkers in the United

States so let's see okay it looks like

you were ticketed with public urination

no priors seems like a one-off sort of

thing can we count on you to be back

here in six weeks for your trial of

course great we're done here no this is

a routine thing statistically he's

virtually guaranteed to turn oh we're

done here

we're done here Steve by hand grenade

to the crack team of legal enforcers

meet Deborah hello this is Debra from

pretrial services I'm just calling to

remind you about your upcoming court

date this Thursday well you're welcome

I feel like it I can't you know

back to work and then there's Brett so

all these are risk assessments this is

all computerized but you know I keep a

yeah a hard copy just in case that's why

they call him the Annihilator

and finally Gerald the guy in charge of

urine tests clear if there's something

in there that's illegal

I will sniff it out so that's what I do

I'm a piss sniffer

we got one because this fall we'll be

bringing you all the thrills and

excitement of pretrial supervision if

this elite team brings people to justice

well we don't bring them to justice it's

more like we make arrangements for them

to bring themselves to justice ignore

that this show is full of high-stakes

drama pray I don't get you for Secret

Santa this year

Debra and interoffice romance gerald is

a blood

uh-huh yeah she wants me and if it were

to follow their cats I would hit that I

would knock the bottom out most

we take you closer to the action

[Music]

pretrial services coming this fall to

A&E it's cast effective mother

[Applause]

you

We're gonna talk about
the media,

specifically, one increasingly
influential member of it,

Alex Jones,

the Walter Cronkite of shrieking
batshit gorilla clowns.

(CROWD LAUGHING)

And I know you may be thinking,

there is nothing more I need
to know about Alex Jones.

Because you've probably seen
crazy clips like this.

ALEX JONES:
What do you think tap water is?

It's a gay bomb, baby.

And I'm not saying people
 didn't naturally

have homosexual feelings.
 I'm not even getting into it.

You think I-- (GUFFAWS)
I'm like shocked by it,

so I'm up here bashing it
because I don't like gay people?

(YELLS) I don't like 'em
putting chemicals in the water

that turn
the friggin' frogs gay!

Do you understand that?

(GRUNTS) Crap!

Wow. If he is that upset about
a government conspiracy

that is not happening,
just imagine how upset

he's gonna be when he finds out
about one that is actually is.

Like the fact
that the government

is turning raccoons bi-lingual.

Oh, that's right, they're all
fluent in French now

and they will be working
that into conversation.

And that famous clip
is by no means and outlier.

Jones is a charismatic performer
who gets charged up

on a regular basis,
so there are plenty

of lesser known outbursts
like this...

My spirit is close than evil
and I feel it

and my whole spirit just goes...
(SCREAMS)

They call that crazy,
that's not crazy,

that's my will,
my human spirit saying,

"Crush those
that would hurt the innocent!

Go after the enemy,
build a civilization,

be honorable!

Crush the snakes under
your feet!"

Well, at least now we know
what Friday Night Lights

would've looked like
if they'd given Coach Taylor

-a nasty PCP habit.
-(CROWD LAUGHING)

Go after the enemy!

Crush the snakes
under your feet! (SNIFFS)

Clear ice, full house.
I've got the snakes everywhere!

Stop those snakes,
motherfuckers. (SCREAMS)

(CROWD CLAPPING AND CHEERING)

Now look, ideally, ideally,
the first thing you should know

about The Alex Jones Show,
is nothing.

But, unfortunately,
it is an important part

of a lot of people's
media diets.

An estimated six million people
listen to his radio show

or watch it online every week,

and we know at least
one Jones fan seems to be

current Russian Ambassador
to the United States,

-Donald Trump.
-(CROWD LAUGHING)

He-- he supposedly called Jones
after the election,

has tweeted content from
Infowars and one of its editors

and just a year and a half ago,
even appeared on his show.

TRUMP:
 I just wanna finish by saying,

your reputation's amazing.
I will not let you down.

You will be very,
very impressed, I hope

and I think we'll be speaking
a lot.

The only thing that could've
made that moment any grosser

is if Nigel Farage, Bill Cosby
and Phil Spector

-were all on the same call.
-(CROWD GROANING)

So look, it is no wonder
that Jones has been getting

a lot of coverage, recently.

We even mentioned him
on our first show of the season,

back in February
and in his response to it,

he seemed a little annoyed
with me.

Your ratings are in the toilet,
you're a joke,

they brought you back,
revamped...

out of the gate,
to attack yours truly.

After you lectured us
that Donald Trump

could never win,
over and over again,

as you know,
you're the intellectual,

everybody knows a British accent
is intellectual.

(CROWD LAUGHING)

You know, there's no facts
behind it.

And now, you make fun of me
out of context,

and I'll go,
"Look at this loon!"

Hey boy, people want legitimacy,
they want real.

They want to hear somebody
that can speak to 'em

and touch 'em inside.

-(CROWD GROANING)
-Okay, okay, I--

A few things there.
One, don't call me boy.

And two, my British accent
does not sound intellectual.

Believe me, I sound
like a chimney sweep

passing through a wood chipper.

But-- but I will give him this,
Jones is right,

that too often, people don't
present him in his full context.

So tonight,
we are going to do that,

and let's first set aside
the key context,

that Alex Jones has repeatedly
used his show

to fuel speculation
that the Sandy Hook Massacre

was staged by the government,
which has been deeply hurtful

for the parents of those
children over the years.

That is disgusting
and should be disqualifying

in terms of ever taking
him seriously.

Sadly, doing things
that disqualify you

from being taken seriously,

doesn't really seem to be much
of a thing anymore.

But-- but there is a piece
of context,

you may be less aware of

and that concerns the nature
of Jones' show itself.

It is four hours long,

and if you tune
into the whole thing,

your most shocking discovery
might be how frequently

and shamelessly he pitches
products that he sells.

In fact, remember that clip from
him earlier,

yelling about snakes?

Let's just go back to that
and play it out a bit.

Be honorable! Crush the snakes
under your feet!

(SIGHS) Get behind me, Satan!

(PANTING) Now before I go
any further...

before I go any further...

we gotta fund this operation,

we got the very best
nutraceuticals out there.

I don't know if I can run this
for another week or so,

we wanna run this
through the end of the month,

that's like 11 days.

'Cause I don't want it
to sell out before more gets in

Woah! That is a hard turn
to have to make.

(YELLS) The Satan-worshiping
deep state globalists

are gonna murder you
and your entire family!

Open your eyes, sheeple,
they are coming for you,

they're coming for all of us!

(CLEARS THROAT)

But first...

-McGillicuddy's Oatmeal.
-(CROWD LAUGHING AND CLAPPING)

The perfect way
to start your day.

And look, that clip
is not an anomaly.

In one week of recent broadcast
on his sight,

we found he spent nearly
a quarter of the time,

either talking about
or playing ads for his products,

or pointing you
to the Infowars store.

And if you have never gone
shopping on Infowars, you are in

for whatever the exact opposite
of a treat is.

Because there's the kind
of survival gear

that you would expect
alongside more surprising items

like organic shampoo,
body wash and deodorant

as well as products like
Combat One Tactical Bath Wipes

a ten-dollar pack
of moist towelettes

that can be used anywhere
needed,

including the perineal area.

Which, if you're wondering,
is this region, right here.

-(CROWD GROANING)
-That's right, Alex Jones

is trying to sell you
sloppy wet rags for your tait.

And-- and when you are done
wiping down

the area between your genitals
and anus

with a glorified wet nap...

why not pick up
a Bill Clinton Rape Whistle?

Which, according to Infowars,
should be used

to let Bill know
you're in the crowd

and that you know the truth.

That truth, by the way...

You just spent six dollars
on a whistle.

Oh, that's right we bought this
and by the way our order came

with a free
"9-11 was an inside job"

-bumper sticker...
-(CROWD GROANING)

...that we most assuredly
did not ask for. And look...

radio hosts doing ads
is not inherently unusual,

but since 2013,
Jones has increasingly focused

on promoting his own products,
which he sells on his site

under his Infowars Life brand,

particularly, vitamins
and nutraceuticals,

which I believe are the result
of the word, "nutrition"

fucking the word
"pharmaceutical" from behind.

(BED CREAKING)

I'm pretty sure
that's what it is,

but this-- this is a big part
of Jones' business.

Two thirds of his funding
reportedly comes

from selling his products
and they are a lot of them.

And the reason I know that
is we bought a whole bunch.

Now, let me break them down
for you.

There is a Super Male Vitality,
a Super Female Vitality,

"Wake Up America Patriot Blend"
coffee, Lung Cleanse,

Brain Force Plus,
something called DNA Force

that cost 120 dollars a bottle,

and Child Ease, a herbal blend,
which, according to Infowars,

is "designed to sooth the mind
and bodies of children"

which is a profoundly,
creepy phase.

And then, there is Caveman True
Paleo Formula with bone broth,

a chocolate flavored drink mix,
made from bee pollen, stevia

and the dust
of chicken skeletons.

Now, according to Infowars,
it is one of the most popular

new health trend
in the world today.

And by the look on Jones' face,
it tastes

exactly as good as it sounds.

You pour that in on a couple
of ice cubes.

And folks, it tastes...

when it's creamy and thick,
I think, better than Ovaltine.

And it has got all the bone
broth and so much more.

This is why, the ancients,
they believe were--

had such better bones,

were so much healthier,
you can look it up.

This-- you could freeze this
and this will be better

than, like,
bluebell chocolate ice cream.

Mm!

(CROWD LAUGHING)

(LAUGHING) Okay!
Okay, I know for a fact

that Alex Jones did not enjoy
drinking that glass of Caveman.

Because, I have got a glass
of Caveman, right here.

And I can confirm to you
that it tastes...

(COUGHING)

It taste exactly how you imagine
a drink would taste

that's made from chocolate
and domesticated bird corpses.

It-- it comes at you in waves.

And that is not the only time
that Jones has used himself

as a guinea pig to sell
his own products.

And a warning, now,
to our younger viewers,

the following footage of a man
graphically too comfortable

with his own body,
may be disturbing.

Just ten minutes
before we taped this,

I decided to do this
'cause I haven't done this

in a while.
We took photos... a year ago,

And then again
 about six months ago

and the weight loss
 is dramatic,

already from what happened
 before.

(CROWD LAUGHING)

Okay, so you're redder...
and you're wearing a belt.

The only thing I can discern
happened

between those two photos

is that you walked shirtless
in the sun for two hours

to a belt store.

You-- you could flip those
two photos around

and the effect would be
exactly the same. Also...

And look, to be fair to Jones,
he does have a medical expert,

who consults on many
of his supplements,

Doctor Edward Group III,
who looks like the lead

in a Director DVD
Kato Kaelin biopic.

But he's actually even less
impressive than that.

Here he is in an Infowars ad

explaining the importance
of one of the products.

GROUP: If you're suffering
 from abdominal pain,

allergies, even like headaches,
 anemia,

weakened immune system,
 gut problems, depression,

hair loss, uh... excess gas,

muscle pain, nervousness,
I mean, all of these things,

if you look at some
 of these conditions

and then us opening up
 our borders

and all the other countries
opening up our-- their borders,

you're just dealing with
 a mass amount of parasites

or are harmful organisms.

You can type in
 "refugees spreading disease"

I mean, the CDC is going crazy
right now.

Actually, I'm pretty sure
that if you type,

"refugee spreading disease"
into Google and press enter,

it just takes you
right to the Wikipedia page

for xenophobia, which,
at the end of the day,

is a real time saver for you.
But despite the fact

that Doctor Group looks like
what would happen

if Tom Petty was machine washed
instead of dry cleaned...

(CROWD LAUGHING)

... Alex Jones swears by him.

In fact, he's been
pretty defensive

about Doctor Group's
credentials.

It doesn't matter you've got
degrees from MIT

and everywhere else
and a bunch of other degrees,

the media makes fun of you
and says that you're an idiot.

-(SIGHS) That's right.
-I mean literally they say

we cannot sell coffee,
it's a fraud.

That's right, that's right.

I-- I've been
a research scientist

for a long time, I do have--

I am MIT alumni
and I can tell you

that I do research
all the time--

Okay, stop.

A-- Look, let's break down
that "bunch of degrees"

Jones mentioned.

Group does have
a Doctor of Chiropractic degree

from Texas Chiropractic College,

but, while he listed-- lists all
these other schools on LinkedIn

we checked and he didn't
graduate from any of them.

In fact, we asked him
and he admits,

he does not have
an undergraduate degree.

And as for whether he's
an "MIT alumni,"

he only completed a non-degree
certificate program there,

in fact, just to be sure,
we contacted MIT,

and according to them,
"It is not accurate to say

he has a degree from MIT...
and calling him an alumni

would be inaccurate
and misleading."

(CROWD LAUGHING)

Which does make sense
when you think about it.

Because this man doesn't look
like an MIT alumnus.

He looks like
a fifth-year senior

at the University
of Falling Off a Surfboard.

So-- so just to clarify Alex,

that is what we are making
fun of, when we make fun

of Doctor Group.
Well that, and, the fact

that he looks like
what would happen

if Iggy Pop got "The Rachel."

(CROWD LAUGHING)

And look! Jones can inflate
Doctor Group's credentials

all he wants. He says a lot
of crazy shit on his show.

But it is noticeable
that when it comes

to selling his supplements,
he can sometimes show a caution

that is pretty out of character.
Just watch him

bend over backwards
to repeatedly qualify

what he says,
seconds after he said it.

Maybe you've had
back pain before,

maybe you've had nerves
that were cut off.

This creates tingling, this--
A lot of people have

their feeling come back.
I'm not gonna make claims

if this research is true.
Organically based bio PQQ,

but it's not
technically organic.

(CROWD LAUGHING)

The other stuff's synthetic,
(INDISTINCT) are lab-made.

This is made
from organic sources...

but the bacteria is GMO.

I'll just tell ya up front...

but it's not like
the super high-tech stuff.

It's a bacteria that's just
been bred,

to be able to then secrete
and produce.

It's just like beer is bacteria,
it's a lot of good bacteria,

obviously, but this one--

that's how the Japanese do it.
But it's bio-identical.

This stuff is only found
in comets.

And in trace amounts
in blueberries.

(CROWD LAUGHING AND CLAPPING)

Wait. Wait.

OK, so let's break that down.

It repairs nerves
but maybe doesn't.

It's organic but not really.

It contains GMOs, which is bad,

except for when he's
selling you something

and you can only find
its ingredients in comets.

Oh, and blueberries.

And it's the drop off
after that last one

that is really incredible.

You can only find this stuff
in dinosaur bones

and in trace amounts
in Ritz bits.

And look, Jones's products
don't come cheap.

For instance, he sells
this one fluid ounce bottle

of Vitamin D3 for 29.95.

But consumerlab.com,
a supplement watchdog,

points out that you can buy
the same amount of D3,

from other sources,
for less than four dollars.

But Jones will often give you
a hard sell.

Sometimes, he'll tell you
his products are different

than the ones that you can find
in stores,

and sometimes,
he'll go even bigger.

It is absolutely
in the crystalline form,

the strongest, you absorb it.

So, folks, don't go out
to the store and get iodine

from, say,
one of the big chains.

It'll kill you!

Woah! Wow! I honestly
did not know

that you could imply
your competition kills people.

Four out of five dentists
prefer Trident gum

and the fifth dentist is dead
because he put a piece

of Wrigleys in his mouth
and that's basically suicide!

And to hear Jones tell it...
to hear Jones tell it,

his products are marked up

just enough to keep
his business going.

As he explained
in his recent appearance on,

Rationalizing Low Ratings
with Megyn Kelly.

It may cost 45, 50 million
dollars a year, around that.

How much money is being made?

Well, the money that's made

is pretty much put back
into things.

Okay, so that is remarkable
for two reasons.

First, 45 to 50 million dollars
is a lot of money.

And second,
Jones would have you believe

that every penny they earn
is being plowed back

into a show that looks
like it was filmed on the set

of a low-budget porn parody
of itself.

In fact, as he frequently tells
is audience,

he needs them to buy more
to keep

his truth telling crusades
solvent and growing.

JONES:
 We need to fund ourselves,

and we find ourselves
 by you buying the products.

We're at a shortfall now
because of the massive,

sustained economic attacks
we're under, but the listeners

in just two weeks
have almost narrowed that gap.

I could have to sell my house...

to keep this place running
three, four months.

I could have sponsors
every segment.

I don't do it.
I plug enough to fund things.

Fund us, give me the energy

and I will attack the enemy.

Exactly! It's like
an NPR pledge drive

for people who hate NPR.
Because to listen to Jones,

Infowars is perpetually
on the edge of disaster.

He even has a link
on the Infowars store,

where you can just
give him money,

to help fund the fight
against tyranny.

And contributors
have left comments like,

"Twenty-five dollars
may not be much,

but I know
every little bit helps."

But Jones seems
to be doing a bit more

than just keeping his head
above water.

Ex-employees describe
a thriving business

with one saying,
"He can sell 500 supplements

in an hour...
It's like QVC for conspiracy."

And in one of those clips
we showed earlier,

we noticed he's wearing
what looks like a Rolex watch

worth around 8000 dollars.

Which... cool.

And, y'know,
as we looked around,

we noticed he also seems to have
another two different Rolexes.

And you know... cooler.

And here's the thing,
that is honestly fine.

He can have fancy watches.

There is nothing wrong
with him getting paid.

I get paid to make this show.

But it does fight
with his message

that he needs you
to buy products

to help keep his show going.
And even Alex Jones

seems to be
a little self-conscious

about that disconnect.

But don't worry,
he's reconciled it

in a truly amazing way.

I wear a blue sports coat
and a Rolex

because it's a symbol
of middle-class

and humanity having prosperity
and promoting human prosperity

for respect
of empowering humanity

and stealing the image
of a man in a sports jacket

with a Rolex,
that is the satanic image.

So, I dress as a Satanist,

so that I can enter their world
and show you

that none of it means anything.

Oh bullshit!

How stupid do you think
your audience is?

Okay, you bought a Rolex

so you could dress up
like a Satanist.

What are the other two for?

And incidentally tormenting
the parents of Sandy Hooke

should comfortably get you
into the satanic club.

I believe that's the easy pass
to whatever hell's version

of the champagne room is.

And look, so, at the start
of this piece,

I promised Alex Jones
that I would put his statements

in context, because he is right

that if you place small clips
in isolation,

he looks like a loon.

But if you play them in context,

he looks like a skilled salesman
spending hours a day

frightening you about problems
like refugees spreading disease

and then selling you an answer.

Remember that gay frog clip
at the start?

He did a follow-up show,
explaining how chemicals

were being placed in the water
to feminize society

and reduce the population,

and then immediately
segued to this...

We shell five different brands
of the very best water--

water filtration systems
 out there.

They're amazing,
 they cut out 99.99 percent

of the glyphosate,
 the herbicides,

the pesticides, the fluoride.

I mean to an untrained eye,
it sure seems like

he was using the idea
of a gay frog

to sell his products, which,
incidentally is the same mistake

-the WB network made.
-(CROWD LAUGHING)

And-- and listen, listen!
I'm not saying-- I'm not saying

the only reason Jones is talking
about the globalist,

systematically feminizing us,

is to sell over-priced
nutraceuticals

so he can buy luxury watches,
but if I were saying that,

it certainly wouldn't be
the stupidest conspiracy theory

that you've heard
so far, tonight.

So, if Alex Jones wants
his words in context,

this is it.

The fact that he happens to sell
so many solutions

should really re-contextualize
how you think

about what he is claiming
are problems.

Think about it like this.
How would you feel,

if at the end of this segment
that may well have made you

feel a little dirty, I tried
to sell you something

to wipe that gross feeling away?
Would you question my motives?

Well, I certainly hope not,

because that's what we are doing
right now.

(CROWD CHEERING)

Come with me. Come with me
because I'm proud to say

that we've been working
with a leading medical expert,

and I would like you
to meet him right now.

Please, please welcome
Doctor Ted Group III.

-(CROWD CHEERING)
-Doctor Ted.

Ah, so happy to be here.

We-- we're so happy
to have you, doctor.

A-- and we are-- we are here,
the doctor and I, to offer you

the John Oliver Moisture Armored
Tactical Assault Wipe.

The first tactical wipe
for use, exclusively,

on the perineal.

That's right.
Uh, for goodness sake,

don't use this anywhere else.
You're gonna wanna just focus...

-Right.
-...on this area right here.

-JOHN: OK.
-DOCTOR: Right here.

Now... now... now Doctor,

Doctor, how is this going
to make people feel better

about what they've seen tonight?
How...

Well my studies show
that when you vigorously apply

this taint wipe,
it causes a sensation

that distracts the brain
from whatever it had previously

-been thinking about.
-(CROWD LAUGHING)

OK, and again,
you've got degrees from MIT,

and everywhere else,
and a bunch of other degrees.

The media makes fun of you
and says that you're an idiot.

-They do.
-(CROWD LAUGHING)

Just-- just for the record,
you did go to MIT, right?

Well I've definitely
physically been there.

That's... that's essentially
the same.

That's what I've been telling
everybody.

Now-- now you can actually
buy one of these wipes

at infowipes.com
for one million dollars.

This is real.
They are actually available

for a million dollars apiece,

and don't even think
about buying a similar wipe

in a store, because those wipes
will kill you.

Yeah, also, these wipes
have the power

to heterosexualize frogs.

So uh, that's very nice to have,

'cause that's been
a real problem

-what with all the refugees.
-(CROWD GROANS AND LAUGHS)

And look-- look, this tactical
taint wipe has demonstrated

incredible results,
hasn't it, Doctor?

Absolutely, it sure has.

Look at this photo of me.

And now look at this photo of me
 forty-five minutes later...

-after applying the taint wipe.
-(CROWD LAUGHING AND CLAPPING)

You-- you're much redder there.

-I'm so much redder!
-So much redder!

-So disturbingly red!
-So much...

So, if you want to spend
a million dollars

on a taint wipe,
go to infowipes.com,

and if you're thinking, "Well,
no one's going to do that,"

all I will say is, people pay
Alex Jones 45 dollars

for a jar of chocolate flavored
chicken juice,

so anything is fucking possible.

[Music]

the police who as these Montana cops

show frequently have to deal with

humanity at its worst

what's the first amendment what's the

first name Dan right we're at it what's

the first amendment you don't even know

ah Constitution yeah yeah Constitution

absolutely read it and live by it let's

have a seat in the back of the car

let us see Ron Paul 2012 and he's as

perfect it's it's not like he needed to

say Ron Paul 2012 that was implicit in

everything he said up to that point but

it's certainly nice to have it confirmed

now as you know the police have been at

the center of a great deal of

controversy lately it's been impossible

to escape from the black lives matter

movement to Colin Kaepernick's protest

to mary j blige awkwardly singing a

Springsteen song at Hillary Clinton is

it a gun is it a nice is it or wallet

this is your life you can hear kill just

living in your American skin

oh hello me thank you

Oh God Oh God

Hilary would have won my undying respect

if she just looked mary j blige straight

in the face and said I support your

message but that was awkward as and

I wish you hadn't done it that would

have been honest now now the trust

between police and the communities they

serve

is clearly a cornerstone of civilized

society unfortunately that Trust has

been rocked following a series of

controversial police shootings from

Elton Sterling to Philander Casteel to

Tamir rice to so many others I literally

cannot mention them all and cumulatively

these deaths taken with countless

smaller incidents of police misconduct

have led to a common refrain listen I

just want the police to be held

accountable we just want the system of

policing to be held accountable those

police need to be held accountable the

same way that you gonna hold me

accountable if I broke the law whenever

they mess up whenever they commit a

crime whenever something goes wrong I'm

too much serious stuff like murder and

whatnot

these guys never get prosecuted now

those are valid frustrations although as

a quick sidenote murder and whatnot

would be an amazing CSI spin-off that's

a watchable show right there so police

accountability is what we're going to be

talking about tonight and before we go

any further I should say as the police

will tell you they have a difficult

dangerous challenging job no reasonable

person would disagree with that but

that's all the more reason for ensuring

that it's done to the highest standard a

cake decorator has a challenging job but

the worst thing that happens if he

up is you end up wishing someone a happy

anniversary and yeah well that's

obviously not ideal who knows maybe it's

their anal versary too

the police will also argue that what

they have is less an institutional

problem than it is an individual one

there's been some bad apples out there I

think that but I don't think that that

is indicative of the entire police

department yeah you got bad apples but

you got bad apples and every occupation

just like any business you're gonna have

some bad apples they're out to protect

you and that's what policing is about

are there bad apples yeah okay

that is a weirdly blasé attitude because

bad apples can erode trust fast Snow

White

wasn't afraid of apples before she took

a bite out of that one really bad one

but I'm telling you the next time an old

lady comes out there with a piece of

fruit snow is gonna get the can up there

and that argument it's just a few bad

apples has some real problems for a

start it doesn't address bad laws and

policies that good officers are made to

enforce which we've touched on multiple

times before criminal justice is kind of

our show's signature bit it is to us

what assessing the shape of your poop is

to dr. oz also you can't claim there's

just a few bad apples when no one knows

exactly how many there are there are

nearly 18,000 different police

departments in America and they are not

great about reporting or sharing data in

fact even some surprisingly basic

questions are hard to answer as the head

of the FBI admits we can't have an

informed discussion because we don't

have data people have data about who

went to a movie last weekend or how many

books were sold or how many cases of the

flu walked into an emergency room and I

cannot tell you how many people were

shot by police in the United States last

month last year or anything about the

demographics how is that possible we

have numbers for almost everything we

have ratings for how many people watched

Jeremy Piven in mr. selfridge the

government even tracks how many people

are killed by falling TVs each year a

number surely inflated by people who are

watching mr. Selfridge and said I choose

death and then pull the

down on top of it in fact the best

numbers on police misconduct come from a

researcher named Philip Stinson who

accumulated over a decade's worth of

data by setting up 48 google alerts in

2005 Google Alerts and his stats are

truly chilling out of thousands of fatal

police shooting since 2005 only 77

officers have been charged with murder

or manslaughter and to date only 26 have

been convicted and while the truth is

many police shootings are justified 26

seems suspiciously low so how can that

be the number well broadly speaking most

investigations of police misconduct

faced a few obstacles and the first one

is big misconduct is often investigated

internally by officers colleagues which

does not inspire confidence although if

you listen to the police chief in

Bakersville California the system is

just fine

you're absolutely confident that

structure of review is entirely

impartial

I am I these guys are experts in the

field they reported ahamed they're

investigating they have hundreds of

years of law enforcement experience

combined and so I have the utmost

confidence in these individuals here's

the thing their combined experience is

not a thing that automatically makes you

do a better job our staff has a combined

347 years in television and that doesn't

mean we won't just throw off load of

raisins on a desk and call it

entertainment and and and unsurprisingly

the DOJ has consistently found flaws

with internal investigations in

Cleveland investigators admitted they

intentionally cast an officer in the

best light possible when investigating a

use of deadly force and in Miami

investigations took so long that at

least two officers shot and killed a

suspect while still under investigation

for a previous shooting and there should

never be a second one of anything before

you figure out whether the first was

justified call it the Dolphin Tale to

rule how is there a second one of these

I thought Harry Connick jr. ate the

dolphin at the end of the first one I

don't know for sure I haven't seen it

but no one has and that's the

point and in Baltimore the DOJ report

included the story of Joe crystal a

detective who had reported to fellow

officers for alleged excessive force and

was labeled a rat with one colleague

leaving pictures of cheese on his desk

which is almost charming until you learn

how far some others went he found

himself cut off he says he didn't get

back up in dangerous situations

someone even left a dead rat and his

windshield was like their way of telling

me you know you don't belong here this

is what we think of you ouch

leaving a dead rat on an officer's

windshield is definitely hostile unless

of course that officer is a police cat

in which case it means welcome to the

force whiskers we're lucky to have you

enjoy the rat but police accountability

doesn't just suffer from an unwritten

code of silence that code can be

enshrined within state laws or union

contracts as well for instance one

reason it can be hard to spot problem

officers is that in many jurisdictions

policies allow disciplinary records to

be destroyed in Baton Rouge a sustained

complaints can be stricken from your

record after just 18 months and in Mesa

Arizona when a journalist started

demanding records a police chief

actually made an internal video

reminding his officers that there was a

way for them to clean up their past

I don't want anybody have to relive a

problem that's already been adjudicated

that they've already been disciplined

for that has already seen the scrutiny

in the public eye so perjure files

according to policy make sure that

there's that the things that you don't

want in there aren't in there that seems

wrong you should not be able to erase

parts of your past that are damning this

is an official police file not like

Volkswagen corporate history that

somehow starts after World War two yeah

Nazi cars the choice of the Nazis

and deleting records is not an officer's

only option to escape their past

sometimes after an incident they'll

simply resign and move to another Police

Department this happened so much people

in law enforcement called them gypsy

cops in South Carolina TV station looked

into one officer who spent a total of

nine years on the job working for nine

different departments three of them in

just one year and in one case he left in

spectacular fashion deputies believe

Yarborough's driving ability was

compromised and they said they

discovered a half-empty bottle of rye

whiskey and a baggie of assorted pills

in his patrol cruiser according to the

state records Yarborough said I'm not

taking no drug test

I guess I'll resign holy I'm not

taking no drug test

I guess I'll resign is a sentence you do

not want to hear from a police officer

it's barely appropriate coming from a

roadie leaving Aerosmith and gypsy cops

have been involved in tragic incidents

in the Tamir rice case the officer who

shot the twelve-year-old had been in the

process of being fired from his previous

job before resigning

but the Cleveland Police missed that red

flag when hiring him because they didn't

read his personnel file which detailed

an incident during weapons training

where he had a dangerous loss of

composure leading his supervisor to

conclude I do not believe time nor

training will be able to change or

correct these deficiencies that is the

kind of performance review that should

keep you from getting hired at Staples

let alone a job where you're given a

f--king gun that cop by the way was

never even charged like many such cases

his never made it past the grand jury

which seems inherently surprising until

you realize local prosecutors and cops

have to work together all the time which

can get very complicated as a former

prosecutor I can tell you you work with

the police you rely upon the police you

trust the police the police are in your

office reviewing evidence examining

evidence preparing for trial and then

have to turn around and prosecute them

to prosecute you exactly for a

prosecutor to go after a cop they work

with is incredibly awkward

I can't think of anything more

inherently awkward other than of course

this oh thank you oh god oh god it's not

getting any better nothing in Hillary's

life has ever been more awkward than

that and think about what a high bar

that is an even when cases go to trial

officers have a major advantage which is

that juries tend to have a natural

predisposition to trust them police

officers truly get a presumption of

innocence whereas most criminal

defendants don't come in with any

presumption of innocence you're swimming

upstream usually a judge will toss the

case at a preliminary hearing or a grand

jury will refused to indict so you never

even get the trial and jurors just do

not come in with any belief whatsoever

that officers can commit a crime they

just don't it's true many people see a

police uniform and automatically think

trustworthy unless of course it includes

a sleeveless shirt and a boom box in

which case they think stripper and

sometimes weight gym from middle school

and under under the law the police

generally have a certain amount of

leeway regarding lethal force meaning

that fatal shootings can be considered

legal even if they are unnecessary or

disproportional there is even a

shorthand for such cases it's lawful but

awful which I believe is also the legal

definition of Woody Allen's marriage I

think that's it

who are you angry with here

put the booze back in your pockets and

on top of all this officers can bring in

expert witnesses who can present nearly

any situation as a potential threats

take dr. bill Nowinski who runs

something called the force Science

Institute for years he has testified on

behalf of police officers here he is

providing a rationale for why it may be

okay to shoot someone that has a knife

knives can actually be more dangerous

than a gun they don't have to be

reloaded they can be used at close

distance we know that a stab from a

knife or stab or a cut can be extremely

quick hey come on

that is not the motion you make when you

are stabbing someone that is the motion

you make when you are a teenager

magician finishing a trick is this your

card but but there is no doubt there is

no doubt a knife is a dangerous weapon

but what if someone doesn't have a knife

dr. Lewinsky could force still be

necessary when someone is unarmed first

of all it's significant to know that

unarmed doesn't mean they're not

dangerous in fact a fist may have been

the very first weapon that human beings

used against each other I measured

strikes on human beings by other humans

and the strikes can occur at a speed of

four or five or six strikes in a second

and some of them really hard what is he

talking about the only type of fist is a

match for a weapon is during a game of

rock-paper-scissors and even then it can

be defeated by paper with four reasons

which make no sense to me whatsoever but

that's not the point

look look defendants are allowed to call

expert witnesses of course what is weird

is lewinsky has appeared before grand

juries which is where prosecutors are

supposed to present their best

unchallenged case for an officer's

indictment so why would they let

Lewinsky in there they're essentially

shooting their own case in the foot

which is presumably justified because

feet were the second weapon ever

invented

unless we've we focused heavily on

trials here but in a perfect world there

would be enough accountability

throughout policing that the blunt

instrument of a trial would very rarely

be necessary so how can we fix all this

well for starting a body cameras have

increased transparency and Trust in many

places in Rialto California after just

one year of using them the number of

complaints filed against officers fell

by 88% and the use of force drops by

around 60% and when Baltimore's trial

run of a body camera program ended their

Police Commissioner begged for their

return police officers want cameras I

think this is just a moment where

everybody wants cameras I was speaking

to some folks just before we came in

here and apparently we had a couple

police officers who were turning in

their body worn cameras and they were

asking you know when can i when can we

get these back right and these cops

aren't M night Shyamalan if they plead

with you to let them have a camera again

you should give it to them give it to

them and body cameras are obviously just

one solution other cities have tried

requiring officers to file separate

reports every time there's a use of

force or they've used early intervention

systems to try and spot problem officers

or they brought in outside prosecutors

to handle controversial cases the

problem is police unions fiercely fight

any attempted reforms just listen to

James Stewart head of the biggest police

union in Newark where the DOJ found that

three-quarters of police stops had no

legal justification to listen to him if

anything the police are being too

scrutinized I don't know where the

problem started but there is an

animosity or a lack of trust you know as

soon as there's any sort of physical

force exerted by a police officer

everybody's got their cell phones out

you know they want to catch us doing

something wrong when you got the cop out

there in the street facing all this

negative opposition day in and day out

does it come a point when the police

officer is gonna say hey you know what

maybe he doesn't have to go to jail yeah

maybe I'll take the path of least

resistance maybe I'll put the blinders

on as I'm driving by the corner where

the ten guys are hanging out okay yeah

there is a lot to unpack there first

throwing a ten

and threatening not to do your job

because you face public criticism is

pretty childish you think Steven Seagal

gave up on his movie career just because

people said mean things of course not

just this year he starred in end of a

gun the perfect weapon the Asian

connection code of honor and sniper

special ops why cuz he's a king

professional that's why and he commits

to his job but but but more importantly

when you say you might ignore 10 people

hanging out on a corner yeah

maybe do that because that's not

typically a crime in in some cases 10

people on a corner is just a king

yardsale still for many people

Stuart's argument that you know for

police to be effective they need to be

given broad leeway to use force is very

appealing

it's especially appealing for those of

us who for whatever reason are fairly

confident that that force won't be

applied to them but it is worth looking

at the actual cost of that trade-off

because a lack of trust in police

accountability leads to a lack of trust

in police and we now have reached the

point where there are schools who host

classes like this one to teach kids how

to safely interact with law enforcement

I want you to repeat after me I want you

to say officer am I free to go

one more time officer Oh am I free to go

the hope is with this simple advice

teens can protect their rights and maybe

their lives that is so

depressing especially when you realize

that's probably the only class where

nobody will raise their hand and say

when are we ever going to use this and

when you see something like that it

makes it hard to buy in when someone

dismisses police misconduct issues like

this they're out to protect you and

that's what policing is about our abed

apples here yeah but here's the thing

about that the phrase isn't it's just a

few bad apples don't worry about it the

phrase is a few bad apples spoil the

barrel and we currently have a system

which is set up to ignore bad apples

destroy bad apples records persecute

good apples for speaking up and show

all dangerous emotionally unstable

apples around to the point that children

have to attend key Apple classes you

cannot look at our current situation and

claim that anybody likes them apples

Nuclear waste.

The worst type of garbage
for raccoons to get into.

Now, it's a substance
that we all know is dangerous

thanks to movies like this.

NARRATOR: They tormented him
 until he had a horrifying

accident and fell into a bag
 of nuclear waste.

Melvin became
 The Toxic Avenger,

the first superhero born
 out of nuclear waste.

-His face is so terrifying...
-(SCREAMS)

NARRATOR:
...we can't show it to you now.

You'll have to see the movie
 for yourself.

Honestly, you really don't need
to see the movie, 'cause...

his face isn't really
that terrifying. This is it.

I mean it's bad, but its--
it's so ugly,

it's almost cute again.

It's like-- it's like someone
melted a candle shaped

-like a pug.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

But-- but the point here is

nuclear waste, the radioactive
and toxic byproducts

from making nuclear energy
and weapons is

a serious health hazard,
and America has a lot of it.

ANCHOR: There are more than
 71,000 tons of nuclear waste

stranded
 at the nation's 104 reactors.

Put all those
 spent fuel rods together,

and you get a pile
 as big as a football field

and more than 20 feet tall.

Or you could put them
in a pile as big

as two football fields
and ten feet tall

or half a football field
and 40 feet tall.

Or 20 football fields,
one foot tall.

The point is, we have a lot of
nuclear waste and it's very fun

-to play with.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

And look, that is just the waste
from nuclear energy.

We also have more than
100 million gallons

of hazardous liquid waste
from producing weapons.

And you may live closer
to nuclear waste than you think.

One out of three Americas lives
within 50 miles

of high level nuclear waste.

Some of which, like plutonium,
is lethally dangerous,

and will be-- will be around
for an incredibly long time.

NARRATOR: Even microscopic
 amounts of plutonium,

if ingested, are deadly.

One of the characteristics
of it is it has

an extremely long half-life.

Plutonium 239, for example,
has a half life

of about 24,000 years.

It's true, 24,000 years and that
just scratches the surface.

It takes ten half-lives
for plutonium to become harmless

so that's 240,000 years.

A unit of time more commonly
known as one English patient.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

And as any adult with
an American girl doll collection

eventually finds out,
if you wanna keep something

around for a disturbingly
long time, you have got to find

an appropriate place to put it.

"I cannot live
with your murder dolls anymore.

Felicity stares at me
while I sleep!

She stares at me!"

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS, CHEERS)
-"She stares unblinking!"

And look,

I'm not the first person
to make this point.

Look at this news report
from 1990.

NARRATOR:
 Almost half a century

after nuclear power
 was harnessed,

there still is no agreement
 on where to store the waste.

"We have built the house,"
 said one critic,

"and forgotten the toilets."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-A home...

with no toilets. Or as a realtor
selling a Brooklyn loft

is calling it right now,
"artisanal composting."

Wait.

You're suggesting that
I shit in that potted plant

while you and I both know that
I will do that

'cause this is convenient
to public transport,

and has both northern
and eastern exposures.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

But look, it-- it has been
27 years since that clip

and our country still doesn't
have a nuclear toilet.

And that is
our subject tonight.

Why do we not have
a nuclear toilet?

And it's actually easy
to understand how we got

into this situation.
Because during World War Two,

we rushed to develop nuclear
weapons because we were trying

to defeat the Nazis,

who, fun fact, pretty much
all Americans agreed were bad

-at the time.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Anyway, the-- the thing is,

we didn't really have
a plan on what to do

with all the radioactive
byproducts that we produced.

And this initially led us

to some mind-blowingly
stupid solutions.

For instance, for years,
we actually did this...

MAN: They loaded the, uh,

radioactive waste and it was
in barrels, 55 gallon barrels,

of, uh, radioactive waste
with concrete poured over it.

It's funny, the ocean
don't glow out there

outside of Red Bank, New Jersey.
(CHUCKLES)

Really. 'Cause we dumped
a lot of barrels out there.

-(AUDIENCE GASPS)
-That is true.

We didn't just dump barrels
of radioactive waste

in the ocean, we did it
off the coast of New Jersey.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

That is so horrifying!

I'm surprised that Jersey Shore
was the title of a lighthearted

MTV series, and not the name
of a harrowing documentary.

An entire generation of children
was born without thumbs,

a phenomenon known
to locals as...

-"The Situation."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

And, incidentally,

not all of those barrels sank.
In fact, in 1957,

when two barrels were
caught floating off the shore,

naval aircraft were summoned
to strafe them

with machine-gun fire
until they sank.

That's right.

They shot barrels full
of nuclear waste

with machine guns!

That's got to be one of the most
terrifying sentences ever said

out loud, right after,

"Donald Trump is
the president now,"

and, "Wait, wasn't Felicity
on a different shelf

when we went to bed last night?

Oh, my God!
Felicity is a waking nightmare!"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Oh!

Well, the truth is, tossing
barrel-fulls of nuclear waste

into the ocean and shooting them

with machine guns is actually
preferable to at least

one genuine other idea
that was thankfully rejected,

and that was blasting it
into space.

A concept
with a pretty clear flaw.

WOMAN: Unfortunately,

we don't have a great record

with getting rockets
 out into the atmosphere.

If any one of them blew up,

that would basically contaminate

a large portion of the Earth
 with radioactive material.

(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

WOMAN: So that's probably
 not a great idea.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Yeah.

You're right. That's probably
not a great idea.

I mean, a really great idea
would be also filling

the rockets up with confetti,
so at least that way

if there's a horrific accident,
there's also a party!

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Now, over the years, we have
dumped nuclear waste all over

the country and in many places,
there've been frightening leaks.

Take the Savannah River Site
in South Carolina,

where waste from poorly-stored
material leaked

into the ground water.

And just watch this alarmingly
laid back man explain

the consequences of that.

MAN: There are radioactive
 alligators on the site.

(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

MAN: Radioactive materials are
 in the sediments.

-(ALLIGATOR HISSING)
-(CLANGING)

MAN: It's gonna go
 up the food chain and...

there's gonna be
 radioactive alligators.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Yeah.

Radioactive alligators!

They even have names,

Tritagator and Dioxinator,

after two of the wastes
that poisoned them.

And that's actually very clever,

because if I had
to give them names,

I don't know, I'd probably
have gone with something like,

(SCREAMS) "Holy Shit! A Fucking
Radioactive Alligator!"

And, "Oh No, Fuck Me,
There's Another One!

What Nightmare
Hath God Wrought?"

And it's not just reptiles
who've been impacted

by nuclear waste.
Researchers are now studying

an area in North St. Louis
County, Missouri,

where tons of waste
from the Manhattan project was

improperly stored,
some near a creek

that winds through
residential communities,

and people who live there have
noticed some alarming trends.

JENELL WRIGHT: I got on Facebook
 in order to reconnect

with people from high school...

And we all immediately
 started noticing that so many

of us were sick.
 We've discovered that

the Department
 of Veterans Affairs

officially recognizes around 21
cancers associated with exposure

to ionizing radiation,
 and compared that list

to what we had.

We had all of those cancers,
 every single one.

That is an incredibly
depressing thing to discover

on Facebook and it's-- it's hard
to know how to respond.

I mean, you definitely
don't want to use

the "like" button, because...

then it looks
like you really like the fact

they just got cancer.

Now, there is
that new sad emoji,

which would really be perfect

if you hadn't already cheapened
it by using it to respond

to the news that Chris Pratt
and Anna Faris were separating.

I mean, it is sad. It is sad.
But it is not "21-cancer" sad.

It's "nine-cancer" sad.
Tops.

The point is, thankfully,
60 years ago,

our government
and the scientific consensus

came up with a solution.

In 1957, the National Academy
of Sciences issued a report

urging the creation
of a permanent storage facility

deep underground.
Basically, a nuclear toilet.

And while we did build
a repository

for lower-level waste
in New Mexico,

we still haven't built one

for the most dangerous,
high-level waste.

And, as a result, it's
essentially been left

wherever it was made.
Which is not good,

because those facilities
were not built

with the idea that they would be
storing waste indefinitely.

So, to continue the toilet
metaphor,

we've basically been shitting
in bags,

leaving them
all over the house,

and praying
that they don't leak.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

And the most frightening
example of this is

the Hanford Site
in Washington state,

which created two third
of the plutonium

in the US arsenal
and is currently storing

56 million gallons
of highly toxic

and radioactive waste
underground.

And over the years,

there have been so many issues
at Hanford,

that they've achieved
a dubious honor,

as one local
new-station reported,

with an almost prideful tone.

ANCHOR: The most contaminated
 place in the entire

Western Hemisphere isn't
 at a polluting factory

or an old chemical plant.

It's right here
 in Washington State.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
Oh!

"It's right here!
We did it guys!

Washington State, home
to the most contaminated place

in the Western Hemisphere,

thousands of acres
of apple orchards,

and several of Ted Bundy's
grizzliest murders. We did it!

Right here!"

There have been a string
of problems at Hanford,

from explosions,
to toxic vapor releases,

to over a million gallons
of waste

leaking out of their tanks
over the years.

It has been so bad,
the government has had

to pay out nearly
one and a half billion dollars

in compensation to thousands
of workers for illnesses

stemming from exposure
to radiation

and toxic chemicals there.

A local news station has done
a series of reports

on Hanford, and after a tunnel
collapse this May,

they found some of
the infrastructure there is

almost comically badly
put together.

ANCHOR: Mistakes during
 construction are factors

in the dangerous state
 of the tunnels.

They're 55 and 60 years old,

well beyond their expected
 life span.

In addition, wood beams holding
 up the tunnels are eroding,

and what corrodes timber beams?
 Radiation.

Yeah!

You can't build something
out of wood and expect it

to last forever. You're supposed
to have learned that

from the second dumbest
of the Three Little Pigs.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Hanford... Hanford is
a gigantic problem.

And even though it hasn't
produced anything for 30 years,

the Department of Energy
still spends

nearly two and a half billion
dollars a year

on cleaning it up, which is
close to ten percent

of its annual budget.

And it is pretty weird

to find out that a place
you just heard about

is getting that much
of the DOE's money.

It's like finding out that half
the Department of Agriculture

budget goes to this moose
named Gordon.

I mean, I don't know
the right amount,

-but that seems like a lot.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

And in case you're thinking,
"Well I'm definitely glad that

I don't live near Hanford,"

remember there are nuclear
power plants storing waste

all over the country,
lots of it in so-called

"spent fuel pools."

That's where nuclear
fuel rods are supposed to be

temporarily placed to cool down,

and then put
into dry containers,

and then moved

to permanent
underground storage sites.

But remember,
we don't have one of those.

And in many places those pools
are just accumulating

more and more rods.

And while experts say
it's highly unlikely,

if a Fukushima-like accident
happens at one of those,

the results could be
catastrophic.

ANCHOR:
 The northeast has a number
 of nuclear power plants,

including the Indian Point plant
 just outside of New York City.

If any one of those
 were to have

a severe
 spent fuel pool accident,

you're taking away
 a lot of big cities,

a lot of farm lands,
 a lot of the United States,

for decades, perhaps centuries.

That's right,
lots of big cities.

New York, Hartford, Boston.

And that last one is
a real shame,

'cause as I understand it,
they only just got

un-racist yesterday.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-So...

I mean, at least they could get
to enjoy their new life.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-So...

So, look, it is pretty clear
we need to find

a permanent facility to store
our most dangerous waste.

And 30 years ago,
we actually settled on a site,

Yucca Mountain in Nevada.

Congress passed a law
designating it

as our sole candidate
for waste storage.

Now since then,
we've spent 15 billion dollars

prepping the site,

as you can see
from this rather upbeat video.

NARRATOR: Located
 about 100 miles

northwest of Las Vegas,

Yucca mountain is the most
 thoroughly researched site

of its kind in the world.

Experts throughout the world
 agree that the most

feasible and safe method

for disposing
of highly radioactive materials

is to store them
 deep underground.

That's right.
The best place

to put nuclear waste is
in a hole deep underground.

Much like Felicity.

Wait. Wait, if she's not there,
where is she?

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Ah, Jesus fucking Christ!

Fuck me!

Jesus! Fucking--
Get the fuck away!

(PANTING)

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

(PANTING)

-(AUDIENCE CHEERS)
-It's alright. It's okay.

I'm fine.

It's fine.

The point is...

So, Yucca mountain
is our permanent storage site.

So the problem is solved,
right? Well, no!

Because while the site
has been deemed safe,

and the people
in the immediate area,

Nye County,
actually support the project,

many Nevadans elsewhere
in the state

really don't want it.

And their former senator,
Harry Reed, lobbied hard,

eventually managing
to get Yucca shot down.

Now, to be fair, he did have
an alternative plan

for all the states sitting
on their nuclear waste,

but to put it mildly,

it was not exactly
scientifically-sound.

Leave it on site, where it is.

Leave it where it is,
and dry cast storage containers.

If you were smart,
what you would do is, uh...

leave this...

leave it where it is.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

"If you're smart,
what you would do is leave

the thing where it is"
is terrible advice

for dealing with nuclear waste.

Although, it is coincidentally

the title of Britain's
bestselling book on parenting.

-But... But...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Here... Here is the truth.

the scientific consensus
for decades

has been that leaving it where
it is is a really bad idea.

The shutted power plant
at San Onofre, in California,

is storing nuclear waste,
and it's on a fault line

right next to the ocean.

And that sounds like
something you learn

in the first scene of a movie
starring The Rock

that you watch on a plane.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-And look,

maybe Yucca is the best place

to store our growing supply
of radioactive garbage.

Maybe it's not.

I am not a nuclear scientist.
I just have the face of one.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-And... And our--

Our new energy secretary,
Rick Perry...

yes, Rick Perry...

has said that he is
optimistic about fixing

the whole problem,
which does sound great.

Although, he didn't exactly do
a great job

at dealing with this disaster.

♪ (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

Yeah, that was him
on Dancing with the Stars,

and on the basis of that,
managing volatile energy

is not really his forte.

But here's the thing.
We've been saying

that we are going to fix this
for decades now,

and we seem to be no closer
to a solution.

And let me show you something

that really drove that fact
home to us,

because we've
been researching this story

for a couple of weeks now,
and just yesterday afternoon,

we stumbled on a TV special
from 1977,

the year that I was born.

♪ (MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

NARRATOR:
 NBC News presents...

Danger! Radioactive Waste.

Yeah, this problem is so old

they reported on it back when
the news was kept

in an America-shaped vault
that you had to open

with a crank.

As we watched that yesterday,
we gradually

and chillingly realized that
by pure coincidence

it hits every beat of the story
that we just told you.

It opens with footage
of sailors throwing barrels

into the ocean.

It looks at the facilities
at Hanford.

It talks about radiation's
impact on workers

and on families
who live nearby.

And while it doesn't have
a radioactive alligator,

it does have radioactive cows.

Which is-- which is still good.
Although,

I did prefer our alligator.

I liked it when he went...
(HISSES)

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-But--

But the most chilling moment

in that documentary might be
the one where they sit down

with someone in authority,
and demand to know

exactly when this will be fixed.

NARRATOR: When you ask
when the problem will be solved,

you get answers like this.

WOMAN: What's the realistic
time table?

Realistic time table
is scheduled to have

a repository in operation
by 1985,

with the selection of the sites
by the end of 1978

for detailed work.

Exactly.

Nuclear waste is a problem
we were supposed to have dealt

with in the 1980's
and still cannot solve,

much like this Rubik's Cube
that I always carry with me.

You are my Jean Valjean,
cube, and, one day,

-I shall defeat you.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

And at the end
of that special, remember,

40 years ago, the correspondent
delivers this special message.

The waste
increases every minute.

The solution of where
to put it is years away.

And none of the previous
 solutions has worked.

We are accustomed
 in this country to act

only in times of crisis.

But with nuclear waste,

when the crisis comes,
 it will be too late.

And that was
from four decades ago.

We have already waited way
too long to resolve this issue.

And we are dancing
with trouble here.

So if any one says
the government

can just continue to wait,

they are much like
a house with no toilet.

Absolutely full of shit.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS, APPLAUDS)

our mom is going tonight concerns breast

implants some are against them others

believe they're fine in rare cases and

many believe you should be able to get

them whenever the you want

sorry did I say breast implants I meant

abortions tonight's main topic concerns

abortions before before you change the

channel before you change the channel I

know this is a polarizing topic although

interestingly when the website Vox asked

people in the street for their opinions

the issue wasn't quite as binary as it's

usually presented if I had to pick I

would say that I'm pro-choice but

personally I'm more on a

somewhere in the middle I wouldn't but

arcade choose for other people I'm

pretty car pro-life I think when the

cutoff point that's just my stance I'm

not the kind of guy like that I want

everyone to follow my stance okay well

not needing anyone to follow your stance

is a healthy attitude to abortion and

it's also a terrible attitude with which

to leave the Rockettes you do you

Bethany you do you girl you do you the

truth is people's opinions on abortion

make up a spectrum but most of us

believe it should be legal in at least a

few circumstances in fact only 19% of

Americans told Gallup they thought it

should be completely illegal and if you

are in that 90 percent you are frankly

excused from watching the rest of this

but but but do rejoin us at 11:29

because once I'm done talking about this

we'll all be watching a video featuring

a bucket of sloths and and I promise you

it is almost violently delightful but

but until that time the rest of us

really do need to talk about abortion

laws because wherever you are on this

spectrum whether you like me believe

that women should have the right to

choose or whether you believe abortion

should only be allowed in a few

circumstances then this story should

concern you and here is why since 2010

new state laws have contributed to the

closure of about 70 abortion clinics and

these four states are down to exactly

one abortion clinic each that's right

Mississippi now has four times as many

S's as it has abortion clinics and if

you're thinking how is that possible

well it's in no small part because the

key Supreme Court decision concerning

abortion is no longer Roe vs. Wade

it's the 1992 Planned Parenthood versus

Casey ruling that said states can create

restrictions as long as they don't place

an undue burden that places an a

substantial obstacle in the part of a

woman seeking an abortion meaning women

can be asked to jump through a few hoops

just not too many which might sound a

little less insulting if those weren't

also the rules for a dog agility course

and the vagueness of that ruling is

allowed states to introduce dozens of

what some have called trap laws or

targeted regulation of abortion

providers though their supporters to an

Erie degree all characterize them

somewhat differently this is really

about the issue of women's health we're

protecting women's health and safety we

are protecting women's health I just

wanted to reiterate that this is really

all about protecting the health and

safety of women yeah but when you're

that insistent about women's health it

starts to sound suspicious it's like

having a folder on your computer called

definitely not porn yeah you're not

fooling anyone you're asking more

questions than you're answering so so

let's take a look at what these laws

actually do for women's health

starting with Texas's hb2 which passed

in 2013 and had two key stipulations it

requires abortion clinics to meet the

same building standards as outpatient

surgical centers and requires their

doctors to have hospital admitting

privileges

okay now hospital admitting privileges

and high building standards sound great

until you realize what they actually

mean sort of how Moondance

sounds like a lovely night of romance

and whimsy but really means having sex

with Van Morrison and that's not what

you signed up for because the outpatient

surgical center requirements can be

difficult to fulfill as this Texas

clinic discovered explain again why it's

gonna be shut down because this isn't

wide enough yeah cuz right now the walls

that we have they're about three feet

wide and to being ASC it has to be eight

feet wide

now I'm not saying width isn't important

in fact in some circumstances it's far

more important than length is a thing

that I have hurt

penises I'm talking about penises but

that ain't thought requirement is wide

enough for two surgical Gurney's to pass

one another in a corridor which is just

not something that is likely to happen

at a small abortion clinic about 90% of

abortions occur in the first trimester

when they are generally non-surgical

procedures with no cutting and only mild

sedation they usually involve suction or

just taking medication neither of which

require a large surgical facility

you don't need an operating room to take

a pill which is a good thing because you

wouldn't want an entire surgical team

scrubbing in every time Larry King

needed a boner they'll get tired and and

as for Texas's law that doctors have

admitting privileges at a local hospital

a requirement 10 other states have also

passed that can shut a clinic down

because many hospitals for financial or

political reasons won't grant them to a

doctor who performs abortions and again

defenders of these laws will say they

have a simple purpose by requiring their

abortionists obtain admitting privileges

at local hospitals we are protecting

women's health yep but are you though

because it's worth noting both the AMA

and the American College of

Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have

argued there is simply no medical basis

for requiring local admitting privileges

which does make sense because hospitals

will see anyone they'll see you if

you've gotten an Elmo PEZ dispenser

stuck in your butt

they'll have questions for you but they

will see you they'll see you they'll

question you and later they may laugh at

you and while we are on the subject of

safety legal abortions have a mortality

rate of point zero zero zero seven three

percent that is nearly ten times less

than what one study found was the risk

for dying as the result of a colonoscopy

and let's agree by the way all of us

death by colonoscopy has to be one of

the worst ways to die right after having

your mother cachi masturbating and what

you're trying to pull your pants up you

fall and hit your head so your dad has

to carry your panceliss to the car to

take you to the hospital and the girl

next door you have a crush on tries to

help but she's laughing so hard at the

size of your penis that she closes the

door in your hand stopping your mother

who slams her foot on the gas dragon you

be

the car for several blocks while your

father yells your TV show is derivative

and you'll never escape the shadow of

John Stewart's

that's a general fear if admitting

privileges are so important for

continuity of care it is weird that you

don't need them in Texas to run a

birthing center even though one study

found that 12% of women admitted to

birthing centers wound up being

transferred to a hospital so Texas will

shut down an abortion clinic for having

walls too close together but if you want

to give birth in a tub surrounded by

mood lighting potpourri and the music of

Bon Iver no one will say anything other

than just take it down a notch and

proponents of these laws will point to a

few notorious cases like the clinic run

by Kermit Gosnell in Pennsylvania who

wound up being convicted of murder

although for the record his clinic had

not been inspected for 17 years which it

absolutely should have been they didn't

need new laws so much as they needed to

bother to enforce the ones they had

putting absurd new restrictions on all

clinics because of Kermit Gosnell is

like seeing that photo of a Taco Bell

employee licking the food and saying

okay all restaurants have to have

corridors that are eight feet wide

hold on that's gonna shut down most of

the restaurants in the country and

you've done nothing to address the root

problem here and some of these laws have

nothing whatsoever to do with clinic

safety like the ones that force doctors

like Willie Parker to actively spread

misinformation the state requires me to

cover some very basic information with

you first the state requires me to tell

you that if you're having an abortion

it's possible to having complications

there's a risk of bleeding there's a

risk of infection there's a risk of

damage to any of your organs but guess

what those are the exact same risk from

containing a pregnancy and going to turn

the final thing that I have to tell you

that I don't agree with but I have to

tell you in a way having an abortion can

increase your risk for breast cancer

there's not a shred of scientific

evidence to prove that they can require

me to tell you the first part but they

they can't stop me from giving you my

best medical opinion and that is that

there's no increased risk for breast

cancer from an abortion

it must be weird for a woman to witness

her medical professional forced to play

a game of good doctor bad doctor okay

time for your tetanus booster know those

cause autism well it's not a shred of

scientific evidence to prove that bad

doctor bad bad doctor in addition some

states have passed laws requiring

providers to show and describe an

ultrasound image whether a woman wants

to see that or not and when North

Carolina was defending such a law this

was how they attempted to soften that

the proposed law says if a woman wishes

not to see the ultrasound or hear the

fetal heartbeat she may cover her ears

and eyes and refuse to listen oh great

so North Carolina tried to give women

viewing ultrasounds the same option as

women trying to watch John Travolta's

performance in the new OJ Simpson show

oh my god oh my god what is he doing Oh

does he think Robert Shapiro was a sad

clown in Abbas Lerman movie I didn't

want to watch this why are you making me

and some other clinics enter into a

bureaucratic war as a result of these

laws take this clinic in Alabama it was

shut down after not being able to meet

the new building codes Alabama had

forced upon it but instead of giving up

the owner cashed in his retirement

savings to open a new facility that

complied completely with the law and

that is when Alabama started targeting

him directly I'm spared close to a

million dollars to meet all of their

requirements and you think you're done

and what are they trying to do they're

trying to pass another bill that said I

can't be in 2,000 feet of the school

they're treating me the patients the

physicians as sex offenders well they're

treating someone like a sex offender

when he clearly isn't one it's a move

that's now commonly known as I reverse

Cosby look

and look if you are thinking if you're

thinking the job look when a clinic

closes can't women just travel further

you should know there are now mandatory

waiting periods in 27 states some up to

72 hours between an initial consult and

an abortion so women can be forced to

either take multiple trips or plan the

shittiest three-day weekend imaginable

and if that's not possible they can end

up making desperate decisions listen to

one clinic administrator describe a call

from a patient's I told her you can come

to San Antonio we can help you here and

she said I can't I have I don't have the

means there's no way I can get to San

Antonio so what if I tell you what I

have in my kitchen cabinet and you tell

me what I could do I'll tell you what I

have in my kitchen cabinet and you can

tell me what I can do when your state's

abortion laws are forcing people into

the most depressing Quickfire challenge

in Top Chef history I think it's safe to

say they've gone too far because

here is the thing abortion cannot just

be theoretically legal it has to be

literally accessible and remember every

single one of us watching this right now

every every single one of us watching

right now agrees that it should be legal

at the very least in a few extreme

circumstances say hypothetically a young

girl has been the victim of sexual

assault well thanks to these laws this

hypothetical girl might have to travel a

long distance because there were no

clinics close to her and again thanks to

these laws the girl might be approaching

the point where her state won't let her

get the procedure at all well sadly none

of that is hypothetical and I'll let the

Texas clinic director tell you the rest

in order to see her I need to put her to

sleep and in order to do that I need a

nurse anesthetist and because this crazy

law it is impossible to find people to

work for us she's 13 years old and she

is a victim of rape and she drove four

hours from McAllen to San Antonio and we

had to turn her way and there was

nothing I could do to save her and so

now if she has a procedure that if is

huge

shoved all the way to New Mexico and pay

$5,000 and get there

and spend three days you don't never

happen we know about and at that point

we have sentenced a child to motherhood

now that specific provider whole woman's

health is actually at the center of a

Supreme Court case that will be heard

next month if it's a 4-4 tie the Texas

laws stand so the best hope is that

Justice Kennedy seen here in dog form

straightening his tie will see Texas

regulation as an undue burden this whole

situation is basically in his paws now

meanwhile Florida is drafting similar

trap laws and the law in Alabama that

would close that one clinic near a

school will be introduced to committee

later this week and if all this has made

you sad or angry then you should really

keep an eye on these laws and if you

don't have a problem with the current

situation then well it is 11:29 welcome

back

thanks for rejoining us 19% a quick

question what the is wrong with you

but but nothing up top know what putting

our size

I made I made a promise I promise

everyone sloths in a bucket and that is

what you are going to see although if

you are in that 19% I'm going to have to

insist that you cover your ears and eyes

and refuse to listen for everyone else

it is sloth apart you are very welcome

now I know I know this story has not

been the ideal way for anyone to go to

sleep on a Sunday night but but we

thought that this was something you

should really know about and the only

way that I can make it right is to give

you the absolutely ideal way to go to

sleep an actual sloth in a nightcap this

is thank you so much for watching the

show

with knives

Oh

Oh

yesterday marked the 50th anniversary of

the first Selma March one of the pivotal

moments which led to the Voting Rights

Acts but but voting rights in this

country much like John Travolta's hair

are still very much a work in progress

there are the obvious obstacles for many

Americans such as increasingly

restrictive voter ID laws but there's

also the less obvious ones as Congress

was reminded just this week as we

commemorate the 50th anniversary of the

march on Selma this week and the

subsequent passage of the Voting Rights

Act I want to once again call to the

attention my colleagues here in Congress

that there is still American citizens

today who do not have equal voting

rights these are citizens of Americans

island territories the US Virgin Islands

Puerto Rico Guam and the Northern

Marianas yes American citizens living in

u.s. island territories do not get to

vote for president that's the kind of

unsettling fact that deep down you

probably knew but chose not to think

about like the fact that the dog from

full house is definitely dead by now

you're proving my point

more than four million people live in

the US territories more than 98% of them

are racial or ethnic minorities and the

more you look into the history of why

their voting rights are restricted the

harder it is to justify because it goes

all the way back to an America first

acquired them the United States flag is

flying over these lands and so some

people said well doesn't that mean

American laws apply in 1901 the insular

cases basically the judgment of the

Supreme Court was that the new

territories were inhabited by quote

alien races and they may not be able to

understand anglo-saxon laws therefore

the Constitution doesn't have to apply

Wow

alien races can't understand anglo-saxon

principles I find that condescending and

I'm British

we basically invented patronizing

bigotry I do so wish we could explain

the concept of voting to them but during

me they're savage little coconut brains

would probably just collapse

I'm assuming it's coconut milk in there

will soon see wacky stick is not set off

some alarm bells for you the man who

wrote the lead decision in the first of

those rulings was justice Henry Billings

Brown who fun fact also wrote the famous

separate to put equal decision in Plessy

versus Ferguson and even he suggested

these exceptions to the Constitution

should only stand for a time as in a

temporary arrangement but it's been a

hundred and fourteen years it's like for

over a century America's computer has

been saying an update to your country is

available and we've been clicking

reminds me later again and again and

again so tonight let's look at voting

rights in the territories and we'll

begin in Puerto Rico whose citizens are

Americans a fact that comes as a

surprise to a shocking number of people

as we learned when Sonia Sotomayor was

named to the Supreme Court

Sotomayor a Bronx native is the daughter

of Puerto Rican immigrants she was a

first generation American the daughter

of Puerto Rican immigrants a daughter of

Puerto Rican immigrants she is the

daughter of Puerto Rican immigrants

she's the daughter of Puerto Rican

immigrants no she isn't she's the

daughter of Americans who moved from

Puerto Rico in Puerto Ricans are

immigrants anyone anywhere immigrant

broke could you help me immigrate

Apartments on Saturday I need to

immigrate a couch up two flights of

stairs Puerto Rico has more American

citizens than 21 US states but less

voting rights than any of them and

whether or not they choose to become a

state it's a little weird that while

they're making that decision they have a

delegate in Congress who can't do much

my constituents cherish their US

citizenship and have made countless

contributions to this country yet they

cannot vote for president have no US

senators and send one delegate to the

house who has a voice but no vote in

this chamber it's funny infantilizing

when discussing national legislation to

give Puerto Rico the same status as a

six year old voting on where the family

should get to go on vacation

oh what's that Timmy Narnia okay

Colonial Williamsburg it is there and

that you were heard Timmy you were heard

and the same voting rights restrictions

apply to the residents of Guam the

Pacific territory that unequivocally

sounds the most like a Batman punch

[Applause]

[Music]

there is there is nothing not to love

about Guam it is a beautiful island in a

strategically important location for the

US military

so much so their bases currently occupy

over a quarter of Guam's land and yet

the residents of Guam have absolutely no

say in general elections for their

commander in chief which is even harder

to swallow when you consider this

according to guan's Office of Veterans

Affairs at least one in eight adult

Guamanians is a veteran among the

highest percentages of all US states and

territories Guam gives a quarter of its

land and as much as an eighth of its

people to the US military at this point

the American flag should really just be

a guy from Guam waving an American flag

and yet due in part to their lack of

full voting rights those veterans are

shamefully underserved in 2012 Guam

ranked dead last in per-capita spending

on medical care by the US Department of

Veterans Affairs or the VA it's called

the PTSD program look here so it tells

me you to enter my address five options

here but the closest one so far looks

like Hawaii it's three thousand eight

hundred three miles point twenty two

miles that is disgusting the only person

who should have to travel 3,800 miles

for treatment should be a Beverly Hills

housewife flying to Colombia for

unapproved lip injections derived from

cobra venom but but the amazing thing is

just because Guam residents aren't

allowed to vote for president doesn't

mean that they don't go on hold a straw

poll every presidential election and

they're registered voter turnout is

actually higher than that of the rest of

America

and to misquote the words of the great

philosopher Lil Jon turn out for what

that's a great song but just just

imagine how it must feel to have the

desire to vote but know deep down you're

going to be ignored actually you don't

have to imagine it because let this

Gwang voter tell you it's terrible I

mean I I believe it's not fair you know

we're all citizens of the United States

I wish somebody change that okay that

sounds sad but at least on Election Day

that woman gets to wear the incredibly

special I voted and wish it had actually

counted sticker but amazingly Guam still

gets more respect from the US government

than American Samoa as was proven a

little while back when a u.s. member of

Congress was tasked with introducing

their delegates inai Faleomavaega the

chair recognizes the gentleman from

American Samoa mr. king hello and Binga

somolia listen I get his name is a

little difficult but you cannot

mispronounce American Samoa there's a

Girl Scout cookie like the state of thin

mint asipi that would be ridiculous but

watch how gracious Americans Somalia's

delegate was in his response Thank You

mr. speaker to American Samoa

that is class that I do not have because

if I were him I'd responded thank you it

is a privilege to be here in Waffle

tandino great United sporks of Eluga

boink

American Samoans not only lack voting

rights they lack a little something

extra to the US Constitution grants the

citizenship to everyone born on US soil

except in one jurisdiction American

Samoa

in the South Pacific it is a u.s.

territory but people who are born there

do not automatically get US citizenship

I think don't even get automatic

citizenship meaning the American part of

American Samoa is really just a title

that doesn't mean anything like People's

Choice Award nominee or social media

experts just devoid of meaning and that

fact is especially shocking when you

learned that American Samoa a territory

that cannot vote for a president who

could send it to war is also home to the

top Army recruiting station in the

country so now I'm thinking the American

flag should be a dye from American Samoa

waving a flag with a guy from Guam on it

waving the American flag and because of

their status as non-citizens many

veterans have to carry around a

humiliating reminder that they are not

equal in the eyes of the law so this

here is my US national passport the very

last page of the passport makes it

uniquely a US national passport and

makes me look like I'm an outsider I

think it did me if that means me as a

person I think that's right they're not

citizens but Nationals which means they

can't run for president serve on a

federal jewelry or depending on where

they live even become a public

schoolteacher so that they're kind of

like off-brand citizens they're they're

Americans in the same way that these are

fruit loops or this is dr. pepper you

could pretend is the same thing everyone

knows it's worse five American Samoans

are actually suing the government to

change this rule but the Obama

administration has fought them by citing

the insular cases from earlier which

suggest that American Samoans like all

residents of the territories can be

given fewer rights because they belong

to alien races differing from us in

customs and modes of thought and that's

a tricky argument to win in the face of

this kind of evidence where you from I'm

originally from American Samoa and what

do you do for a living I'm a soldier in

the US Army

I joined straight out of high school and

it was something to serve my country and

to give back I'm active service we just

got back from deployment to Afghanistan

for nine months all the way

[Music]

[Applause]

just to be clear that is an Afghanistan

war veteran moving an audience to cheers

and at least one judge to a partial

orgasm with a rendition of a Rihanna

song on a show called America's Got

Talent

if that's not American I don't think one

has ever existed of complicated issues

surrounding what the precise status of

all the US territories should be and

what the people who live there would

prefer but surely when it comes to

denying Americans the right to vote we

have to find a better reason than citing

a 100 year old legal decision written by

a racist that was always supposed to be

temporary and I'm not saying this will

be an easy thing to do I'm just saying

we've figured out a lot more complicated

things in the last hundred and fourteen

years think about it

we invented television we eliminated the

measles and then for some reason

brought them back again WrestleManias

and those things are logistical

nightmares and you know what else we

figured out how to fly and if we

can work out how to climb inside metal

Birds slip the bonds of this earth and

soar through the air to visit these

territories we should be able to work

out how to ensure the four million

people who live there get adequately

hurt

you

[Music]

Donald Trump the only president who

combines the sordid extramarital affairs

of a young JFK with the dead-eyed

puffiness of a post-watergate Richard

Nixon look I know we have talked about

Trump a lot on this show but tonight

we'd like to do it from a slightly

different angle and that is focusing on

his relationship with the world because

while we were away you may remember one

particular remark he made according to

the US president Africa is a shithole

that's right he said that he absolutely

said that except to be fair to him it's

actually worse because he reportedly

called Africa Haiti and El Salvador

holes which is just not okay and I do

acknowledge that I personally have

called Belgium a shithole multiple times

but in my defense a I'm not president

and be Belgium is a load some chocolate

gulag with no objective reason to exist

so you can see that it's very different

you can see that and look you probably

saw people on u.s. TV being justifiably

appalled by those remarks but what you

may not have seen is the response from

the countries he insulted honestly so

sure then she's like has he ever

we not sit home we people we just like

it is a yes because it doesn't

matter what you have he's still going to

the same hole we're the same worms will

eat into Wow

you know it says something about the

Trump era that the phrase the same worms

will eat into actually qualifies as a

hopeful thought I would honestly like

that crocheted on a pillow so I can wake

up to it every morning and look look it

is not like that's the only time that

Trump's remarks have caused an

international uproar he said that Korea

used to be part of China which outraged

South Koreans he claimed that Germany

owes NATO vast sums of money which it

does not and in the UK he retweeted

these anti-muslim videos from a

far-right British group which triggered

massive condemnation and instead of

fully apologizing for it he said it was

a big story where you are but it was not

a big story where I am and that is

exactly his attitude if it wasn't big

where I could see it then it wasn't big

so forget mastering foreign affairs

Trump may not have mastered object

permanence which you really need to be a

good president or even a good

baby and yet here is the crucial thing

the rest of the world continues to exist

whether Trump acknowledges or not so

tonight let's try and answer a few basic

questions at first what is Donald

Trump's foreign policy because it seems

to be little more than repeating a

single phrase America first America

first America first again America first

America first it will be America first

from now on

America first now if you are another

country watching that you may well be

wondering wait

when has America's attitude ever not

been America first they've been putting

America first since the day they arrived

in America very much second but say here

Donald Trump telling in recent years

we've been getting the short end of the

stick on the campaign trail he often

complained that America had become a

global punch line and promised that he

could reverse that the world is laughing

at us folks the whole world is laughing

at us they're laughing at this that's

what's going on in our country the world

laughs at us folks the world laughs at

us we're not gonna be a laughingstock

like we have been and we have been

believe me oh we're not going to be a

laughingstock anymore huh it is insane

that Trump this guy this guy this guy

thought he would end the laughter it's

like a flamingo in boxer shorts named

Phineas J rocket dump ran for president

under the slogan time to get serious now

for the record since Trump became

president if anything the world is

laughing harder than ever before because

while all US presidents do get made fun

of impersonating Trump has become an

international cottage industry Israel

has Trump kicking a Muslim man while

dancing lewdly to guns and roses Germany

has him dancing to Uptown funk

Spain has him flipping off the world and

again dancing like an idiot and there's

more here he is in Pakistan here he is

in Bulgaria here he is in Taiwan

here he is in Ethiopia here's a pretty

shitty one from Turkey where they're not

even trying

here's a Korean Trump and here's one

from an Italian comedy show see him born

in the USA on a stealth fighter before

being taken out with a bucket on his

head

are any of these funny I don't know is

anything about trunk funny anymore

somehow the world's most objectively

laughable human has become a comedy

graveyard when laughter goes to die and

in case you think any of that may have

been good-natured ribbing a recent

Gallup poll shows that the world's

approval rating of US leadership has

dropped to 30 percent after being at

nearly 50 percent just two years ago

that is a precipitous drop in popularity

is the equivalent of replacing gal gadot

in the Wonderwoman franchise with Matt

Lauer look I know I love the Donald

Trump and others may not give a

about what the world thinks about us but

they really should for a number of

reasons chief among them something

called soft power which yes I

acknowledge does sound like an erectile

dysfunction medication for chinchillas

so soft yet so hard but but basically

basically refers to the ability to get

others to do what you want them to do

without using carrots or sticks it's

kind of a country's brand and a nation

soft power can come from many sources

from your pop culture to the ideals you

express to your reputation and diplomacy

can play a major part in it even hard

power practitioners like Trump's own

Secretary of Defense Jim Mad Dog mattis

supports the soft power work that's done

by the State Department that is why a

few years back he gave a full-throated

defense of properly funding it frankly

they need to be as as fully funded as

Congress believes appropriate because if

you don't fund the State Department

fully then I need to buy more ammunition

ultimately now that is scary because buy

more ammunition is his way of saying

without diplomacy there will be more

Wars

he doesn't need more ammunition so he

can make more bullets earrings for his

Etsy store because he's not just

Secretary of Defense he also crafts

accessories for the elegant weirdo now

unfortunately though Trump has shown

little interest in soft power his

administration recently proposed a 29

percent cut to the State Department and

foreign aid and there are

any high-level vacancies at the State

Department to say nothing of our lack of

ambassador's from Belgium to Belize

South Korea to South Africa President

Trump has a problem

his embassies have no ambassador Turkey

Jordan Egypt Qatar and Saudi Arabia all

without ambassadors holy

South Korea Turkey and Saudi Arabia

those are countries where you really

need an ambassador it's not like Lipson

Stein where you can basically scrape by

with a sign that says never stop

Lichtenstein II and as for the

ambassadors that Trump has appointed

some of them are frankly not grapes when

Trump appointed Peter Hoekstra

ambassador to the Netherlands they were

a little upset over there as this

interview shows speaking of threat at

one point you mentioned in a debate that

there are no go zones in the Netherlands

and that cars and politicians are being

set on fire and then I didn't say that

that is actually an incorrect statement

yeah we would call it fake news okay

okay I didn't say that so and so he's

given himself some wiggle room there as

long as he didn't say exactly what the

reporter just claimed about no-go zones

and politicians being set on fire he's

technically correct the only thing in

the whole world

that would make him not correct is if

say video of him saying that cars and

politicians are being bird and that yes

there are no go zones in the Netherlands

there are cars being burned there are

politicians that are being burned and

yes there are no go zones in the

Netherlands it's pretty weird not to

recall saying out loud there are

politicians that are being burned in the

Netherlands it's not the kind of thing

that you do and immediately forget about

like driving to work or seeing the movie

the post I mean I have a vague memory of

walking into a darkened room eating Milk

Duds and thinking Meryl Streep is a

treasure but the rest is a complete

blank

but when Trump was asked about his

understaffed State Department he claimed

that it didn't really matter for one key

reason let me tell you the one that

matters is me I'm the only one that

matters because when it comes to it

that's what the policy is going to be

I'm the only one that matters the only

one that matters is me it's hard to tell

if Donald Trump is laying out a

diplomatic strategy or demanding that

daddy buy him an oompa loompa then his

actions are critical to our nation's

foreign policy and that brings us to our

next question how is his approach to the

world going and the answer surprisingly

is great and now this I'm kidding it's

been a disaster

in fact to give you a sense of how much

damage he can do in very little I can't

believe you nearly bought that he could

do a very little time just look at last

summer's back-to-back NATO and g7 summit

it was just three days of meetings in

which time he reportedly told European

leaders that quote the Germans are bad

very bad then shook Emmanuel krons hands

so aggressively it seemed like he was

trying to masturbate an elephants then

at the g7 conference the next day world

leaders unsuccessfully tried to convince

him to stay in the Paris climate Accord

and in the middle of all of that he gave

a speech where he failed to explicitly

reaffirm article 5 the basic principle

that NATO members should come to the aid

of each other when attacked affirming it

is routine for presidents and it was

even in Trump speech until being

apparently deleted at the very last

minute blindsiding top members of his

own national security team and after

witnessing Trump's erratic behavior for

just three days Angela Merkel was so

shell-shocked

she made this statement the times when

we could completely rely on others are

to an extent / I've experienced this in

the last few days and that's why we

Europeans must really take our fate into

our own hands that was the day after the

summit

I wasn't even supposed to give a major

speech that was at a campaign event held

in a beer tent and that means we're

probably lucky there was an event of any

kind otherwise she would have just

yelled out Europe is on its own at her

nephew's piano recital and this brings

us to our final question what are the

consequences of this well one big one of

them could be that there is a leadership

vacuum in the world so who will fill

that well in Europe the obvious

candidate is Germany but even they know

that there may be an issue with that

well whenever I talk to people in our

neighbor countries they mostly expected

sort of the leadership of Germany but on

the other side whenever I talk to the

people in these countries with a very

good memory what happened in the first

half of the 20th century they are very

reluctant talking about a German

leadership you're right you're right I'm

so glad that you brought that up because

I I didn't want to be the first one to

bring it up but you are absolutely right

when people hear Germany wants to take a

leading role in Europe most of us do

still think no they're still in timeout

and they know why they know what they

did not see Germany now now globally it

seems that China is set to be the

biggest beneficiary because they have

been aggressively seeking to increase

their influence and soft power something

that has not gone unnoticed a nation

head of government recently explained to

me that at every regional conference

Washington sends a couple of diplomats

whereas Beijing sends dozens the Chinese

are there at every committee meeting and

you are not he said the result he

explained is that Beijing is

increasingly setting the Asian agenda

it's true the u.s. is absent at many

important meetings and that doesn't even

include meetings that Jared Kushner was

supposed to attend but he couldn't find

a room and he was too shy to ask someone

and then he realized it was too late

anyway so he just killed an hour

wandering around the lobby pretending to

be on the phone

and the piglets China's increased

influence should be alarming because

they are an autocratic country you don't

necessarily want China setting global

priorities on things like human rights

and democracy and yet

Trump's reckless behavior is opening the

door to exactly that happening not to

mention the fact that what he's doing is

going to make it harder for him to

accomplish his own goals he wants to

contain North Korea or to do that you

might want to appoint an ambassador to

South Korea he wants Germany to spend

more on its military okay but maybe stop

publicly shaming Merkel if you want her

to be able to sell that idea back home

and it wants to contain security threats

like Isis and Al Shabaab in African

countries then maybe don't call African

countries shitholes truck can

say that he doesn't care because his

approach is America first but you need

allies to get anything done

foreign affairs is like sex if you

loudly announce that you will always

come first

you're going to have trouble finding

partners and as for on to other promise

that the world will stop laughing it is

not just comedians doing that it's world

leaders Australian Prime Minister

Malcolm Turnbull was a depressed in the

last year and he had himself a bit of

fun Donald I we are we and we

face pulse they're the ones we're not.we

we're waiting in the real balls get out

of the online bones

they also guy

that is a key ally using the fact that

our president is a pathological liar as

a punchline and crushing that room like

a fourth grader with a carrot stick

stuck up his nose anything think that

was grim let me show you one more clip

we found when we were looking for Trump

impersonators around the world this one

is from Russian TV with a comedian

making fun of Trump's suspiciously close

relationship to Putin and there is a fun

little surprise for you

just at the end Hillary the other day

Hillary asked me Donald do you love

Russia I answered yes I do I love Russia

but you have no evidence against me

by God that is as happy as I've ever

seen Putin ever I guess at least we now

know what type of humor that Putin likes

he likes the kind where he medals in

another country's election succeeds has

a joke about it made to his face in

public and then realizes it all worked

out no one can touch him that's the kind

of humor that Putin likes it just

creases him up look I know that all of

this is depressing because it seems like

America's reputation overseas is under

attack from its own president which is

just ridiculous soft power is an act of

salesmanship it's selling your brand it

is the one thing that Trump is supposed

to be good at and he's blowing

it

so as an immigrant who has fallen in

love with this country for what it's

worth please allow me to speak to the

rest of the world in America's defense

for a moment because Donald Trump does

not reflect America I mean to be to be

completely honest to be completely

honest who does reflect it a bit but the

point is America is not one thing it's a

beautiful mess of contradictions where

good and bad are mixed together on one

hand it makes Mountain Dew which tastes

like a honeydew melon was by a

radioactive cloud on the other hand it

also made this awesome bed shaped like

the Batmobile you can fall asleep in

that thing and be Batman if Batman

somehow got locked out of the Batcave

and had to sleep in his car but that's

the American dream right there America

is the country that came up with YouTube

which yes I know gave you in the world

that head Logan Paul but it also

gave you those videos of adults in t-rex

suits on dirt bikes ballet dancing

exercising and doing basic car repairs

and by the way that magnificent dinosaur

costume that's an American idea to that

the point is America is the country that

gave you Star Wars

you're welcome and Scientology who were

sorry about that and and sometimes

what's great and terrible about us is

just impossible to separate like look

Popeyes Chicken

it's objectively disgusting but I would

run across traffic to eat this but

the point is trevor is the worst of us

yes but he's not all of us if I did is

still America down to one sound it

wouldn't be the braying voice of Donald

Trump screaming America first it would

be the gorgeous voices of the New York

City gay men's chorus singing this song

[Applause]

that's right that's all star by

smashmouth a terrible stupid songs being

sung absolutely beautifully this should

be our new national anthem and so please

world

[Applause]

[Music]

embarrassment the country to incredible

dinosaur costumes

[Applause]

infrastructure it's our roads bridges

dams levees airports power grids

basically anything that can be destroyed

in an action movie

[Applause]

[Applause]

we if an alien species judged

humanity by our most popular movies

they'd think we were furious with

asphalt all the time the problem is

though when our infrastructure is not

being destroyed by robots and or saved

by Bruce Willis we tend to find it a bit

boring as you know infrastructure is not

a sexy or glamorous topic as much as I'd

like to think otherwise infrastructure

is not sexy infrastructure is not very

sexy

yes infrastructure like those men we

just heard from is important but not

sexy although to be fair that may just

be because Hollywood promotes

unrealistic standards of infrastructure

beauty that's not what a real Road looks

like real roads had curves so most most

people think infrastructure for I think

it's boring but but is it because I'd

argue that it's actually pretty

fascinating and I know that in saying

that I've basically become the rad youth

counselor trying to convince you that

Jesus was the Taylor Swift of his time

revelations is a breakup song to the

Romans guys who want another Mountain

Dew catch so let's talk about

infrastructure tonight and let's begin

with dams because dams are amazing

they're the most powerful device we have

for holding back liquid aside from the

idea of using a porta potti oh wait I'll

just wait forever

I cannot go in there America used to

love dams Grand Coulee Dam in Washington

State

biggest concrete structure Boulder Dam

stands today a modern Colossus the walls

of the new dam tower into the sky like

mighty modern pyramid yes and we built

those dams with ingenuity and brawn and

of course piles and piles of dead Irish

that of course we did they're good

workers and their corpses make a solid

foundation material that's an

architectural fact but these days

America's wants great dam system is in a

state of serious disrepair the average

age of the country's 84,000 dams is 52

years and many of them have problems

that stem from when they were first

built yes much like most Botox

recipients and competitive cloggers the

average Dam is 52 years old and probably

has something deeply broken inside of it

you would think a statistic like that

would terrify people into action but

amazingly many states are paying

virtually no attention to their dam

problems in 2007 the last year for which

statistics are available Texas had just

seven inspectors responsible for seventy

four hundred dams that's over 1,050 dams

per inspector the state was only able to

look at 239 dams Alabama doesn't even

have an Inspection Agency to monitor its

2,000 plus dams zero inspectors that

means that the state of Alabama has

exactly the same number of damaged

Spector's as the banned Alabama and it's

not just dams we're currently doing a

terrible job of maintaining all of our

infrastructure the nation's

infrastructure and bridges roads and

pipelines is sorely in need of

renovation collectively they get nothing

more than a d+ a d+ think about that

America got the same grade that a 10th

grade teacher gives a nightmare kid so

she doesn't have to deal with him for

another year

no no London we're not calculating the

surface area of our penises just give

him a d+ and say has family troubles I

cannot even deal with that again

and look to be fair that deep last grade

came from the American Society of Civil

Engineers who would clearly benefit from

more infrastructure spending so it's a

bit like having the state of our

nation's tennis ball assessed by the

American Society of golden retrievers

they're dangerously underthrown this

must change we've been such good dogs

such good dogs but other studies have

also found our infrastructure is lacking

the World Economic Forum ranks America's

16th in the world and we need to be

better because when infrastructure fails

bad things happen like last year when a

pipe burst and flooded the campus of

UCLA a water main break in West Los

Angeles turned the UCLA campus into a

river students walked through ankle-deep

water or in some cases tried to have fun

with the situation I've been chilling

here for 20 minutes trying to get the

best view yeah I actually just came from

the gym it's like I've never seen so

much water except for like lakes I got

[Applause]

it's not just incredibly expensive

it can also be lethal from the big stuff

like bridge collapses and dam failures

to the little stuff like potholes gone

at 53 years old al Li slammed his bike

into a pothole riding along Grizzly Peak

Boulevard in Oakland his wife Nancy says

a car then hit him head-on roads need to

be paved that's why we have

infrastructure that's why we pay our

taxes that's horrifying but the problem

is we only ever seem to talk about

infrastructure when something tragic

like that happens and the scale of this

problem is scary as the former Secretary

of Transportation points out according

to the government there's 70,000 bridges

that hadn't been deemed structurally

deficient yeah what does that mean it

means that their bridges that need to be

really either replaced or repaired in a

very dramatic way

they're dangerous I don't want to say

they're unsafe but they're dangerous

hold on when we're at a point where the

Secretary of Transportation is

struggling to decide between using the

word unsafe and the word dangerous we

might have a problem worth fixing and if

you want a glimpse into how close to

catastrophe we occasionally are take

this story from Philadelphia in 2008 two

contractors from the Pennsylvania

Department of Transportation stopped to

get a sausage sandwich and park their

cars under this bridge

unfortunately they wanted that sausage

sandwich because they saw one of these

piers with an eight-foot gash in it

about five inches wide and if they had

mortar the sausage sandwich there's a

strong likelihood that bridge would have

collapsed so there might have been a

disaster if those Philly contractors

hadn't wanted to stop for a sausage

sandwich which means we were fine we

were always going to be fine

but but but the scary thing is the scary

thing is what if the next crack pillow

in Philadelphia is next to a vegan

smoothie stand that bridge is going down

and people are going to die and it's not

just Philadelphia look at Pittsburgh the

city of bridges and its solution to one

that was dangerously deteriorating one

of these arch bridges actually has a

structure built under it to catch

falling deck see that structure

underneath it they actually built that

to catch in in the falling concrete so

wouldn't hurt traffic underneath it they

built a bridge under the bridge that is

a college sophomore approach to

structural engineering where the trash

was overflowing so I just started

putting it in the microwave problem

solved

I'm a legend and there are dangerous

bridges everywhere here in New York the

Tappan Zee Bridge is so notoriously

shaky one government official in charge

of fixing it cause it's a hold your

breath bridge and the only time we

should ever talk about hold your breath

bridges would be if for some reason beau

bridges were into auto-erotic

asphyxiation and you were trying to

remember which one he was is either

normal bridges or is he the hold your

breath bridges

it's important that I know this the

facts about the Tappan Zee Bridge are

frightening enough and yet the History

Channel felt the need to produce a

terrifyingly cgi filled account of the

worst case scenario some of the Tappan

Zee sound ations

are at risk and this is what could

happen if they eventually gave way

okay one one that's very frightening but

two why did the director assume we'd all

had such a strong emotional attachment

to the coffee cup King Bridge just

collapsed at this point we aren't just

flirting with disaster we're rounding

third base and asking if disaster has

any condoms and the crazy thing is ask

any politician from either side and

they'll tell you that infrastructure is

incredibly important everyone agrees on

this in fact at a recent hearing both

business and labor in the form of the US

Chamber of Commerce and the afl-cio

turned out to support infrastructure

spending and even they know how rare

that is if business and labor can come

before you United on this issue and we

are united on this issue despite our

sharp disagreements on a variety of

other matters I think that should tell

everybody something and tell them very

loudly he's right the last time business

and labor agreed on an issue it was the

issue of how dead should Jimmy Hoffa be

they both agreed pretty dead hey here's

how obvious our need is just two days

ago even a total idiot agreed we have to

rebuild our infrastructure crumbling

everything's crumbling and we're

rebuilding China okay now what's the

labor whatever the he was talking about

regarding rebuilding China that

upside-down piece of candy corn in a wig

made of use medical gauze is right we do

have to rebuild our infrastructure so

with consensus like this how are things

so bad well one of the problems is just

fixing things is not politically

appealing because when you build

something new you get to do this

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

there is nothing politicians like more

than using oversized scissors to cut

through ribbons but you don't get to cut

a ribbon after routine repairs

infrastructure is like Legos building is

fun destroying is fun but a Lego

maintenance set would be the most boring

toy in the world it comes built

and then you maintain it and if you do

it right nothing happens and eventually

you die have fun son perhaps the best

symbol for our neglected infrastructure

is the US Highway Trust Fund it is the

single largest source of infrastructure

funding in this country and guess what's

about to happen to it there's a May 31st

deadline this year the Highway Trust

Fund goes bankrupt unless Congress acts

yeah the fund is about to run out of

money and unlike most broke trust fund

recipients our highway system can't just

get a job at its daddy's Law Firm really

Declan what case are you working on and

does it contain 24 Miller lights I hate

you Declan the reason the fund is nearly

insolvent is that it's primarily funded

by the federal gas tax and there's just

one hitch with that the Highway Trust

Fund gets revenue from an eighteen point

four cent per gallon gas tax but the tax

has not increased to keep up with

inflation since 1993 and the fact that

it hasn't increased means that in real

terms the gas tax has gone down 39%

since 1993 much like Koosh ball sales or

respect for Bill Cosby

I'd like to think it was more than that

but sadly I don't think it is actually

you would think that Congress would fix

this shortfall but we haven't had

long-term transportation legislation for

over a decade

in fact since 2003 it's barely passed

two partial authorizations and 23

short-term extensions one of which in

July 2005 was for just two days two days

that entire extension lasted half a

sting orgasm that's not enough so so you

might think why doesn't Washington just

raise the gas tax and fund the fund well

because that would be incredibly

unpopular listen to what happened when

c-span had a call in and asked people

whether or not the gas tax should be

raised

I don't know that another gas tax is

gonna help us out okay no they shouldn't

raise the gas gauge okay the last thing

we need is new taxes okay if gas prices

go back up we'll be stuck with the super

high prices okay what I want to say is

no war on coal war on gasoline war on

diesel I agree with all of the other

previous callers okay okay that calling

lasted for nearly an hour and they did

not receive a single call in favor of

the gas tax you would think they'd at

least have been prank calls by Mikey in

the Badger dc's number one morning zoo

crew hi I just like to say we should

definitely raise the gas tax

you've been badgered

[Applause]

[Music]

face in the face of that kinda

overwhelming lack of public support it

is hardly surprising that the White

House is not too keen on it either

the administration has not put forward

and does not plan to put forward a

proposal to increase the gas tax okay so

it seems raising the gas tax is unlikely

which is fine as long as you have

another concrete way to raise that money

so what is the White House's plan this

administration has put forward an idea

by essentially you know closing a

loophole that allows corporations to

benefit from stashing some of their

profits overseas okay raise funds by

closing corporate loopholes I think we

all know that is guaranteed to work

the only obstacle would be and I know

that this is highly unlikely if there

were another corporate loophole

somewhere else in the tax code oh oh and

there is one other obstacle when the

president floated this plan by John

Boehner a year ago he swatted it aside

perhaps because Boehner favors his own

plan which he's been talking up for the

past two years I'm committed to working

a defined a funding source so that we

can begin to repair America's aging

infrastructure The Hunt has been

underway for the last year and a half to

find out funding source which I could

report to you we found it but we haven't

we've got to find a way to deal with

America's a crumbling infrastructure and

we do need to do it in a long-term

program that that is in fact funded two

years and nothing that is but an oddly

laid back way to tackle a potentially

catastrophic problem because if a giant

lizard we're attacking our roads and

bridges you wouldn't spend two years

saying yes I am committed to preventing

marauding lizards destroying our city

but we need to do it in a long-term

program that is in fact funded I refuse

to believe that after all this time

Boehner does not have some sort of plan

we actually emailed his office earlier

this week and asked what is Speaker

Boehner's proposal to raise revenue for

the US Highway Trust Fund we didn't hear

back

so we emailed someone else in the office

still nothing so we

call to the office still nothing at this

point we were getting desperate so we

sent in this tweet asking mr. speaker

how specifically will you raise revenue

for the US Highway Trust Fund hashtag

happy birthday Justin Bieber just to

make sure that he would see it for

definite still nothing then we found out

that he's on vine for some reason

because apparently he's 14 in 2013 so we

sent him this mr. speaker how

specifically would you raise revenue for

the US Highway Trust Fund is that six

seconds it feels like I'd be a lot

longer nothing he still didn't get back

to us look the lack of political urgency

in tackling this problem is insane and

you cannot tell me that you are not

interested in this because every summer

people flock to see our infrastructure

threatened by terrorists or aliens but

we should care just as much when it's

under threats from the inevitable

passage of time the problem is no one

has made a blockbuster movie about the

importance of routine maintenance and

repair or they hadn't until now we're a

few feet of concrete can mean the

difference between life and death where

everything you love can be taken from

you in the blink of an eye a few brave

souls are willing to risk everything to

make nothing happen it's time for your

biennial bridge inspection I've got

Thursday afternoon or Friday anytime

before 3:00 this summer get ready for

infrastructure brace yourself for 98

heart-pounding minutes of incremental

maintenance I'm not showing any cracking

note the lamination dose falls on the

concrete deck that you got mild

corrosion on feet you're gonna have to

keep an eye on that thank you sir

don't get cocky the New York Times calls

infrastructure necessary and something I

never thought about but yeah sure

Jesus Scott Bobby behind you sickness

this thing is gonna blow

fifteen or twenty years which is farts

so important that we caught it early

[Music]

in this line of work one mistake could

be catastrophic it's loose boss bolt is

loose well then tighten it god dammit I

don't know which one

okay listen to me listen to me listen

lefty-loosey righty-tighty

[Applause]

[Music]

talk to me what's going on

it's good

[Applause]

holy stone says nothing happens and

that's probably for the best

I came here to chew bubblegum and

inspect bridges

you want to see terrible puns about

engineering you don't fully understand

looks like somebody needs to get their

ducks in a row you want to see 20 minute

monologues on the structural integrity

of girders I'm ordering uniaxial test to

the slab transverse to the deck

corrugations with additional

reinforcement and tension tests of the

support fastener connections between the

deck and the girders bitch routine

maintenance that you can handle they use

PVC piping when they should have used

see PVC piping

god help us you want to see

infrastructure

featuring an all-star cast plus two-time

Academy Award nominee Edward Norton

sorry three-time Academy Award nominee

Edward Norton

and introducing as the chief steve

buscemi I'm the best damn inspector in

the business and I'm here to inspect us

dam infrastructure if anything exciting

happens we've done it wrong sausage

sandwich of course

you

progress it's the reason that your

grandparents views are better not spoken

in public oh why did I bring you to

Straight Outta Compton pop up this is

this is partly on me in the recent

Republican presidential debate there was

a genuinely encouraging sign because the

subject of gay marriage came up and

presidential candidate John Kasich

responded like this guess what I just

went to a wedding of a friend of mine

who happens to be gay because somebody

doesn't think the way I do doesn't mean

that I can't care about him or I can't

love them Wow

a gay wedding just got applause at a

Republican debate add that to the list

of things that would have been

unthinkable in 2004 like the phrase

Academy Award winner Matthew McConaughey

would have said you were insane and it's

not just Kasich Jeb Bush Rick Perry

Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio have all

said they would attend a gay wedding if

invited which I can only imagine is

terrible news for any of their gay

acquaintances who invited them only on

the assumption that they were declined

to attend and send a very expensive gift

instead well I didn't think he would say

yes did I mark now now which of your

friends wants to sit with Bobby Jindal

yes your friends are like my friends

although not all of the candidates have

been quite so clear Governor Scott

Walker for instance had a much more

squirrelly response would you attend a

gay wedding well in terms of that's a

certainly a first place for a family

member taught by our family are we got a

family member who's had a reception I've

been at a wedding but one

marriages still is defined between a man

the woman I support the Constitution the

state but for someone I love we've been

at reception what it's a yes or no

question how the hell did you respond on

the RSVP card when it asked if you

wanted chicken or fish well that's

certainly a personal question for dinner

at Annette and I already had chicken it

was at a restaurant not our home last

week I believe I haven't had fish

recently though I said I still believe

it is certainly a meal which is my

position although according to the menu

there is also maybe a vegetarian option

so to answer your question I have eaten

chicken in the past yes well well the

idea of a gay wedding is increasingly

widely accepted it is worth noting that

there are still a number of surprising

ways to ruin a gay honeymoon today in

most states an LGBT person can get

married on Saturday

posts photos of their wedding on Sunday

and they get fired from their job or

thrown out at their apartment on Monday

just because of who they are okay that's

clearly terrible

the only possible reason you should be

fired from your job after your wedding

is if your theme was stolen office

supplies that's the only logical reason

but it is true that discriminating

against gay people is surprisingly legal

in much of the country the fact is in 31

States people are at risk of being fired

evicted or refused service just because

they're gay so while federal law may

guarantee a gay couple's right to get

married it offers exactly zero

guarantees about their rights to do the

things that normally follow that like

signing a lease on an apartment they

can't afford or conducting tense

discussions about finances in the

brightly lit tapas restaurant of their

choosing or marching into any bank and

applying for a small business loan to

get Brenda stupid cupcakes for dogs or

idea off the ground

Brenda all cupcakes are cupcakes for

dogs they eat their own Brenda

which is just as well because your

cupcakes are terrible

they're terrible be if you are surprised

by this don't worry you're not alone a

2013 poll showed that nearly 70% of

people thought it was illegal under

federal law for someone to be fired for

being gay people believe it because it

feels like it should be true it's

optimistic but wrong like thinking

vertical stripes are flattering or

making your first condom purchase

magnums optimistic but statistically

wrong and there are plenty of recent

real-life examples of discrimination

happening just look at Colin Du Barry

and Kelly Williams a Texas couple who

made the mistake of visiting a

restaurant called Big Al's where their

waitress had something to say to them

she said that we don't serve can I think

bags here

we don't serve here then the

waitress continued they say here at big

girls we like for men to act like men

and for ladies to act like ladies and it

was just so nonchalantly like I like

almost like she was reading a piece of

paper well she was that phrase is posted

on the front door of the restaurant

she's young lady didn't know what else

to say and they just kept on she finally

said and she said we just thought okay

that is obviously appalling and also

someone might want to tell Big O that

having a sign saying when men act like

men is actually the single gayest thing

imaginable so that's an example of

recent discrimination regarding public

accommodation for discrimination in the

workplace take the case of Casey steagle

a gay man employed as a children's

social services worker also in Texas his

fiancee showed up to help him one day

because he was overseeing a field trip

and wanted assistance and the next thing

he knew this happened well later in that

week I got a text message from the

president of children's home saying I

need to come meet with him and then told

me because of my lifestyle choices he

didn't feel comfortable having me on his

team anymore

for the record being gay is clearly not

a lifestyle choice a lifestyle choice is

when a man gets obnoxiously into jazz or

goes on an Atkins

diet and starts a food blog called

protein wolf both of which you should

actually be fired for but that's not

what we're talking about here tonight

the fact is this kind of discrimination

can have ripple effects like when this

Michigan couple had their pediatrician

refused to treat their baby just because

they were lesbians which as they point

out is crazy

we're not your patient she's your

patient and the fact that you can't your

job is to keep babies healthy then you

can't keep a baby healthy that has gay

parents exactly but to be fair no one

can keep any baby healthy regardless of

the parents babies are fleshy bacteria

magnets

they're basically vomits volcanoes

they're going to get sick and they're

going to make you sick that's just a

fact but it is amazing that any of those

stories are taking place in this day and

age and I'm not saying that this is the

case everywhere some states and cities

do have good protections and I suppose

we could wait for every state to catch

up but there are certain issues too

important to be left to the states

specifically civil rights and state

birds

you chose the scissor-tailed flycatcher

Oklahoma are you kidding me

how do not go with the Eastern Phoebe

That Bird is a pure winged Majesty but

you went to chose a piece of garbage

with a beak it looks like it fell out of

Miranda July's hair that's a barn

Oklahoma shame on you you're on the

wrong side of history

anyway the point is states have a

checkered history when it comes to civil

rights just look at Arkansas right now

not only do they not have any

anti-discrimination ordinances earlier

this year they actually passed an anti

anti-discrimination ordinance that

prevents any city or county from

extending civil rights protections to

gay people here is a sponsor of that law

explaining why I want to be treated

equal just like I want someone from the

LBGT community to be treated equal I

want to be fair to them and I want to be

fair to me they shouldn't get more

rights than I do and I shouldn't get

more rights Amil what are you talking

about this is not about special rights

we're not creating lesbians only

sections on airplanes or putting up

signs at Six Flags saying you must be

this gay to go on this right this is

just basic equality that's all in it now

there have been some positive moves at

the federal level just last month the

EEOC ruled the Civil Rights Act applies

to LGB workers and a year ago the

president added LGBT protections for

federal contractors all of which is

great but those protections could be

undone by his successor and it's worth

noting two of the Republican governors

running for president actually weakened

their state's non-discrimination

policies Bobby Jindal let an executive

order expire and John Kasich kept his

but removed the protections for

transgender workers for some reason and

it must be strange to live in a state

and see progress actually move backwards

it'd be like if apple suddenly

introduced the iPhone 7 and it was a

flip phone so that's still not as dumb

as the Apple watch but it's done

not that dumb but done now the main

argument against extending these

protections is that it might infringe on

religious freedom forcing people to act

against their religious beliefs

hence the rise of Religious Freedom

Restoration Act around the country and

religious freedom is not an inherently

bad thing and I'm not just saying that

because I'm the current mega Reverend of

Our Lady of Perpetual exemption we allow

for religious freedom in limited

sensible ways all the time it's why

Muslims can wear a hijab in their

driver's license photo and why devout

Christians can't be forced to work on

the Sabbath but there are reasonable

limits to it and we've all heard it

mistakenly cited in stories like this

Colorado Baker Jack Phillips estimates

he's made 5,000 wedding cakes since he

opened his shop masterpiece cakes 20

years ago a deeply religious man Jack

Phillips says he'll bake birthday cakes

cupcakes and a variety of other sweets

for same-sex couples just not a wedding

cake I actually feel like I'm taking

part in the wedding part of me goes to

the reception parts of you goes to the

reception I have a horrifying sense what

that might mean in a way I've been

married five thousand times in another

way I come in the cake

[Applause]

that Baker denied service to a gay

couple in 2012 citing his belief that

providing them with a wedding cake would

offend his definition of traditional

marriage but that's a little hard to

square with the fact that he allegedly

had no problem providing a cake for a

wedding between two docs and look those

dogs may lick their own balls but I'm

sure even they are now regretting

ordering a vanilla cone cake from the

ejaculating Baker of Colorado but but

the bigger flaw in his argument is his

understanding of how the law works the

Constitution guarantees me the right to

practice my faith my religion anywhere

anytime there are no restrictions on it

it also gives me the right to free

speech anytime anywhere except it

doesn't though courts have already

decided there are limits on religious

freedom for example they found that you

can't discriminate on race based on your

religious beliefs and there are limits

on free speech you can't yell fire in a

crowded theater the Constitution isn't

the star in Super Mario Brothers

it doesn't make you invincible so you

can just do whatever the you want

now just so you know that Baker lost his

case because Colorado happens to be one

of the states that has a law banning

discrimination based on sexual

orientation and when states have those

laws even states with religious freedom

acts cases do now tend to go gay

people's way which is good the problem

is there are still way too many states

that don't have anti-discrimination laws

at all so maybe it's time we just fix

all of this nationwide in one go and

interesting there is something called

the Equality Act in Congress right now

which adds LGBT protections to the Civil

Rights Act the Fair Housing Act and

several others it has over 200

co-sponsors in the House and Senate

unfortunately precisely 0 of them are

Republican which is genuinely difficult

to do for instance there's an actual

bill that just designated September the

25th as national lobster day even that

had two Republican co-sponsors and look

I'm not saying lobsters don't deserve

recognition from our governments

because they absolutely do although do

they that's not the point

that's not the point the point is this

bill represents the bare minimum of not

being discriminated against and this

should be what represents the threshold

of true gay tolerance not whether or not

you would consider attending a gay

wedding so we actually reached out to

every single presidential candidate from

both parties and asked them would you

support passage of a federal law all

laws that prohibit discrimination based

on sexual orientation and gender

identity specifically in the areas of

employment housing public accommodations

and access to credit it's not a

complicated question it's a long

question yes but it's not a complicated

one but only four campaigns got back to

us lincoln Chafee and martin O'Malley

said yes they would but to be honest I

think they were just happy anyone had

asked them anything

so discount that Bernie Sanders also

said he would and a spokesman for rand

paul said and this is true we'll pass

thanks okay you're welcome

everyone else is presumably still

thinking about it but why we reached out

on Thursday and it should not take that

long to work out the answer to should

gay people be discriminated against is

just know that's it because it is long

past time that gay people had the same

rights that straight people have namely

to be fired because they're being

replaced by a computer to be denied

service at a restaurant because they're

neither wealthy looking nor attractive

and more specifically to have a wedding

cake but not eat it because they suspect

a strange man may for some reason have

ejaculated into it

you

you

this year this year we've covered many

depressing aspects of our criminal

justice system from how mandatory

minimum sentencing is crowded our

prisons to how Bale punishes the poor to

how overstretched public defenders

threaten your right to a fair trial to

how small municipal violations can wind

up putting you in the barrel and

fun fact if you binge watch those

episodes in order you are entitled to an

ice cream cone at Dairy Queen

so congratulations enjoy it you have

earned it just to be clear it's not free

and Dairy Queen is not involved in any

capacity the point is though after

learning about our shattered justice

system you frankly earned the right to

eat your feelings with a peanut Buster

parfait the only frozen Treat in America

with nut buster as part of its name

anyone tonight instead of talking about

how people wind up in prison I thought

we talked about how they leave a process

known as prison re-entry it's

particularly relevant this week in light

of what happened just last weekend the

largest one-time release of federal

prisoners in history is getting underway

today the move is in response to a

loosening of mandatory minimum sentences

for nonviolent drug offenders about

6,000 prisoners are being set free today

yes 6,000 mostly low-level drug

offenders were released last week and if

you are one of them let me bring you up

to speed on what you may have missed

since you've been inside um Uber's

replace cabs everyone pretends to like

kale now Matthew McConaughey has an

Oscar and in four states pot is legal

which for some of you must seem like a

cruel cruel irony

now unsurprisingly this news was not

exactly welcomed by everyone

when you release people like that you're

going to have an increase in crime okay

no doubt my mind

some believe the prisoner release is a

racial deal that will put Americans in

jeopardy it's part of an effort to

reduce prison overcrowding but who

exactly are these prisoners are they

dangerous yes are they dangerous is this

the purge is it happening is this the

Pope what what do I need to buy a mask

or will one be provided for me I don't

know how the purge works now now to be

clear by and large these prisoners were

going to be released in a couple of

years anyway so people are essentially

freaking out about something that had it

happened two years later they wouldn't

even have noticed and it's also worth

noting that more than 600,000 people get

released from state and federal prisons

every year so 6,000 more would represent

an increase of less than 1% and the only

time anyone actually notices a change

that small is your dad with the

thermostat and hey when you have your

own place you can heat it like the

tropics but not what he's paying the

bills and fought you're burning money

unfortunately we have a lot of

misconceptions about what leaving prison

is actually like perhaps because it's

often presented in movies and TV as a

happy moment when former inmates rejoin

families and friends and put their life

back together real wort I never thought

I'd get out there's a good young good

hug it was important that we cut a deal

and Kenny was finally free

oh that's so nice although the last

thing was slightly undercut when Patrick

the starfish realized spongebob had

joined the Aryan Brotherhood 1 inside

hey hey he did what he had to do he did

what he had to do but but the sad truth

is for a surprisingly high number of

prisoners their time on the outside may

be brief the national average of

recidivism is 50% so we're spending 80

billion dollars and failing half the

time right that doesn't make any sense

no it doesn't make any sense the only

thing we're allowed to throw billions

out just to fail half the time is this

man

vandalized urban outfitters mannequin

Johnny Depp the fact that around half of

people who leave prison end up going

back is horrifying but when you look at

the challenges they face it gets a

little less surprising in fact let me

walk you through what it's like when you

get out of prison and let's just start

with minute one because when inmates

exit that gate to start a new life they

could find themselves in the middle of

nowhere with little to nothing in their

pockets and the lucky ones might get

enough for a bus ticket and a meal but

even exonerated prisoners like Glen Ford

can walk out with little to build a life

on Glen Ford was given a $20 gift card

the day he left Angola prison gave me a

card for $20 and said wish you luck

how long did that last year one meal had

some fried chicken tea and the French

fries came with it I had four dollars

and change left a twenty dollar gift

card if you're exonerated you should

probably believe in prison

with more than you take home after a

disappointing office Secret Santa and

hey don't don't act surprised that that

gift was terrible your name got picked

by Janice from accounting and you know

she don't give up

she don't give up how about you and look

once your money runs out you can find

yourself hungry and desperate because in

many states anyone with felony drug

convictions can be banned from

government food benefits and if your

family lives in public housing you may

not be able to return home because some

places require tenants to sign papers

banning relatives with convictions from

entering their homes and while those

rules may have been written to reduce

crime in public housing they're

administered so broadly it can lead to

situations like this

Geraldine Miller signed the ban after

her son robbed a bodega at 16 had I

didn't know what I know today I would

have never signed that paper Miller

herself now faces eviction after her son

was caught helping her with groceries

after she became ill she has to go to

her brother's apartment to see her son

my true want me to throw my son away I

can't I can't look we all want people

who've committed crimes to learn their

lesson but never help your sick mother

with groceries sounds more like the kind

of lesson you'd learn from a shitty Boy

Scout leader their kids never help your

sick mother with groceries always know

where the exits are in a dogfight

and never pay a stripper upfront scouts

dismissed and restricted access to food

and shelter could be just the beginning

of your problems depending on where you

live a felony conviction can cut you off

from everything from voting to a

driver's license - and this is true one

Florida County's home weatherization

program so I guess Florida is perfectly

happy to put people behind bars but they

draw the line at putting them behind

storm windows and insulation and while

you could pay for food shelter and

weatherization with a job your

opportunities to get one of those might

be severely limited there are state and

local bands preventing ex-felons from

working as everything from a nurse to a

septic tank cleaner - in Mississippi an

alligator rancher as if breaking into

the alligator ranching business wasn't

already hard enough as it is

you know I taught it's all who you know

who's been eaten by an alligator in that

guy

and a criminal record can even make

getting an interview for a job difficult

nearly every job application will ask a

potential employee if he or she has ever

been convicted of a felony a question

that in some cases will automatically

disqualify you from getting hired and

makes you a little uncomfortable you get

that anxiety when you get to that box

slave Wow

how they gonna judge me you know know

that I committed this crime how they're

gonna feel about this and it's

understandable that an employer might

want to know if an applicant has a

criminal history but to have that

question on a form before you've even

met the person seems a little unfair

they may have changed significantly

since then and you shouldn't judge

someone and what they may be most

ashamed of imagine if you had once

a watermelon maybe it happened 14

years ago you're not proud of it and

you've changed since then if every job

application you filled out had this

question on it with no opportunity to

give context about drunky were or the

fact you haven't even looked at a

watermelon for over a decade you'd begin

to feel like the deck was stacked

against you and some states seem to even

acknowledge how hard this process can be

Ohio actually has a list of job tips for

ex-offenders with do's and don'ts such

as do be honest but if you're asked why

you left your last job don't use

negative words like went to jail instead

do use terms like relocated or contract

ended both of these are true and they

are and before you judge that is not a

lie everyone tries to present the most

flattering image of themselves you do it

when you use a filter on an Instagram

photo of yourself even the Queen does it

because this is her official portrait

but this is who she actually is but deep

down she knows you can't put that face

on money

and all of this is before we get to the

difficulty of ex-prisoners navigating

parole 2/3 of parolees who go back to

prison do so not due to a new crime but

because of parole violations sometimes

for reasons as simple as missing

appointments or failing a drug test and

for some it may be because they're

dealing with untreated substance abuse

or mental illness but for others who are

trying their hardest satisfying the

conditions of parole can be maddeningly

difficult look at Bilal Chatman he spent

a decade in prison for a nonviolent drug

offense but despite the odds he managed

to get his life back on track and find a

job that he loved things were going well

until he hit a problem regarding

scheduling meetings with his probation

officer so he got off I think every day

about 4:00 and so my job didn't I think

it off till 4:30 I said okay what can I

come in early said no you can't come in

early I said what cable can I come a

little later can I get through at like 5

if you leave at 4:30 I don't stay and

wait for you I'm not gonna wait for you

so I don't want to lose my job this is

the things that I'm supposed to be doing

this is what I'm out here for so I'm

working to be a productive member of

society I felt it I felt set up I felt

like I was set up to fail I thought most

people in that situation or set are set

up to fail and you know what it is hard

to argue with that because the only way

Bilal could make an appointment at 4:00

if he left at 4:30

would be if he somehow owned a DeLorean

a TARDIS or whatever the John

Claude Van Damme used in Timecop

I can't remem I think he travelled

through time by doing the splits it's

been a while but I think it was a split

based system

also depending on where you live you

might not just struggle to meet your to

meet your parole officer you might

struggle to pay him because in many

states you actually have to pay for

probation and parole service and in

Pennsylvania they charged us $60 fee

just to enter the program and if you

don't have the money for all the fees

they charge as one Pennsylvania parolee

explains you can be forced to make a

truly ridiculous choice

you also see your parole officer you

don't have money it will hold you job or

no job and if you don't pay you come out

to Joe yeah I know one thing I found

myself southern drug to pay back to

civilian oh god so in order to pay for

the program to keep him away from

dealing drugs he has to earn money drug

dealing at this point the Pennsylvania

Department of Corrections might as well

change its motto to y'all come back now

you're here by now you may be wondering

who is responsible for a system this

broken well interestingly the answer is

pretty much everybody many of the

obstacles you've seen originated in the

tough-on-crime 90s with surprisingly

little debate remember the ban on ex

prisoners from entering public housing

which forced Geraldine Miller to kick

out her son well here's where that

started from now on the rule for

residents who commit crime and peddle

drugs should be one strike and you're

out

that is a state of the union standing

ovations from both sides almost nothing

gets a full room standing ovations

during those speeches with the exception

of veterans God and the speech being

over in many cases these laws were

passed with barely a second thought the

1996 law letting States restrict food

stamps for extra gallons was debated in

the Senate for all of three minutes I've

been talking about this subject for

nearly five times longer than they did

and I'm leaving a lot of stuff out

mainly because I had to make time for

Timecop references and frankly as well

no one batted an eye when bart gordon a

Democrat from Tennessee justified

cutting off federal student aid for

prisoners with this logic just because

one bland hog may occasionally find an

acorn doesn't mean many other blind hogs

will the same principle applies to

giving federal pell grants to prisoners

first of all pigs find nuts by smell so

a blind one is at no significant

disadvantage in an acorn hunt and second

of all people aren't pigs you asshole

and look I know I know

it is not it's not always easy to care

about the welfare of ex-prisoners and

some are going to re offend no matter

what you do but the fact remains over

95% of all prisoners will eventually be

released so it's in everyone's interest

that we try to give them a better chance

at success because under the current

system if they do manage to overcome all

the obstacles we've set it's a minor

miracle and one of the people who have

managed to beat those odds is Bilal

Chapman I'm happy to say that he is

still in his job and he's still doing

well and I'm even happy to say he's

actually with us this evening so please

welcome Bill Chappell please sit down

fill out fill out oh thank you so much

for coming tonight I know that you were

not sure about doing this so I want to

thank you for being here yes

now you managed to keep the job that you

were talking about in that clip and we

saw the state of Ohio giving advice to

prisoners about how to present their

truth and when you when you apply for

jobs you listed your previous employer

as what did you list state of California

the state of California that's right

that is yeah that's technically true

lettuce that's true that's true

yeah um now I know how is the job going

absolutely fantastic I couldn't I

couldn't script it another way

in any way better than what's going on

I'm very excited I'm very fortunate and

blessed

they've given me this opportunity yes I

am dedicated to them you know absolutely

one of and I know I know that you one of

the reasons you're nervous is that

because not everyone you work for or

with knows about the fact that you were

once in prison now you're going to work

tomorrow morning they may know by then

yes

so I guess guess what I want to know is

what what particularly are you most

worried about I got some more worried

about being judged for what it used to

be I'm not that same person you know

I've dedicated myself up I changed

myself I'm no longer that person you

know as time goes on you become you know

I become a better person

I've worked

hardly the things that that I've taken

from society and so yeah so what what

are the concerns that they'll what they

will think or how they might behave what

does this spectrum of circumstances that

you concerned I guess some more people

are judgmental people that don't know

you know I don't want anybody look at me

as the ex-con I want them to look at me

as a person I am now I'm a supervisor

you know I'm a good employee I'm an

employer I even hire and I fire right so

I think they want I want them to look at

me as that continue live that they were

about to both cheer and boo you when you

okay I guess that was interesting you

say that right that you don't want to be

defined by something that you did so

long ago because we're probably guilty

of giving you a reductive term in that

way because we're having you on tonight

as Bilal the ex-prisoner right which is

clearly not who you've been for a long

time right now everyone has at least

three other things about them that are

interesting what what three things about

you not related to that would you like

people to know well I don't like people

to know you know well you know I'm grow

tomatoes you like wait wait I'm gonna

stop you

yeah I'm going to stop you at number one

fair Bilal cos that's a lot more

interesting than I think you think it is

no I'm hoping that tomorrow you're in

your fellow workers may choose really

mainly to focus on the fact you grow

tomatoes right as being a more

interesting part of your life I know

that one of the things that's

interesting is that I know how hesitant

you were to do this we talked to you

through the week yes as we even talked

to you today and tonight I guess a

question would be why why did you end up

talking to us what why are you here

I'm here because it affected um you know

I may never do this again

I've done other interviews I mean I

would do this again because this takes

me back to being that prisoner again I'm

not that prisoner today I'm a taxpayer

you know I work I'm a citizen I'm a

voter that's who I want to be those are

the things that have defined me today

it's not what I did before I did things

years ago then I'm ashamed of you know

that I don't like but I don't want to

relive that at the same time I want this

opportunity to be for someone who says

oh man I can never get a chance I'll

never have a chance there's always a

chance we just keep going but I want the

person also that looks at down at us

that maybe there's a chance for other

people too

that's right I thought fill out I can't

thank you enough for taking the time to

be here Bilal Chatman later the tomato

grower

you

Equifax.

The company whose name sounds
like a theatrical production

in which Daniel Radcliffe,
plays a horse

-that fucks a fax machine.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Now Equifax,

is one of the big three
credit reporting agencies.

The companies who keep
financial data on all of us.

So that people like uh, lenders
and landlords can decide,

whether or not
we are trustworthy.

So, Equifax controls some of our
most sensitive information

and about a month ago,
we learned this.

NEWSCASTER 1:
 Breaking news from the
 credit monitoring company,

Equifax.

Cyber thieves making off
 with private information

of 143 million Americans,

nearly half the U.S. Population.

It's actually worse.

It's now 145 million Americans

and I have got good news
and bad news there.

The good news is that
by "private information"

they don't mean
your Google search history, so,

nobody yet knows about the time
you searched for,

"wario porn (real),"

or "world's richest dogs
looking for assistants,"

or "can loneliness
cause the farts?"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

But the bad news is,
the information they got,

could well be all this.

NEWSCASTER 2: It's your name,
 social security number,

birth date, driver's license
 and addresses where you lived,

information that
 is mostly permanent

unless you're in
 federal witness protection.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Wow! Okay,

so, that does sound bad,

but here's a simple solution,
just move 145 million people

into the witness
protection program.

That means Jones'
uh, you are the Thompson's,

uh, Thompson's
you're the Campbell's,

Campbell's
you're the Mendoza's,

Mendoza's, you're the Jones'.

Wait-- wait hold on,
Jones' you shouldn't be there,

I made you the Thompson's.

No, Thompson's I made you
the Campbell's.

Campbell's,
you're the Mendoza's.

Mendoza's, why are you there?

You should be living
in the Jones' house in Phoenix.

Oh no, I shouldn't have
said Phoenix.

-Oh God, the Jones' are dead!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-The Jones' are dead!
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

Forget the whole plan,
I was just trying to help!

I'm sorry for trying!
Oh, they're dead!

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-And-- and I know--

-I know there might be...
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

...some younger people
watching this

and, well hold on-- who cares?

We're the first generation

to routinely send pictures
of our junk to each other

-over the internet.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Why should we give a shit

about someone seeing
our social security numbers?

But you should know,

criminals can do a lot more
with that number

than they can with a picture
of your dick.

This information
is gonna be sold

left and right
on the black market.

People are gonna be
able to open up credit cards

for the rest of your life
once they have that information.

They can go out and purchase
a home in your name.

They can open bank accounts,
take car loans.

Someone who has your
social security number

could actually take a job,
they could file taxes

and even claim
your kids as dependents

and be gone with your refund

before you ever actually file
a tax return.

No! No!

No, the tax benefit,

is the whole point
of having children.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Without that,

all you're left with
is your actual children.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Which, you know...

-Ugh!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

The point here is,
it's a huge problem

and in any other era,

this would've been
the biggest news story

for a month, but--

but now that
every day's headline

is simply the words,

"Everything batshit
bananas again today,"

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-it slipped under the radar,

but it is worth asking,
"How the hell did this happen?"

Because the short answer is,

the people in-charge have done
literally everything wrong.

And let's start with just--

just the way that Equifax
told us about the hack.

In early September,
their then CEO, Rick Smith,

a man with a face and name
so bland

he may as well be called,
"Human Person,"

or "Frasier re-run."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-He issued a taped apology,

but his remorse seemed a little
less than heart felt.

On July 29th of this year,
we discovered that attackers

had gained unauthorized access
to certain Equifax data files.

This is clearly
a disappointing event

and one that strikes
at the heart...

of who we are
and what we do.

-Holy shit!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Rick Smith is so
alarmingly mechanical

you probably have to put him
in rice every time he gets wet.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now, notably

he mentioned there that Equifax
learned about the breach

on July 29th,

but even more notably that video
was uploaded in September,

which is, and this is true,
after July.

So, Equifax
knew about the breach

for nearly six weeks

before telling the public
and they claim

that they needed that time
because the investigation was

"complex and time consuming."

Although, that's not all
that happened in that time span.

NEWSCASTER 3: Three Equifax
 executives

sold nearly two million dollars
 in company stock,

days after the data breach
 was discovered.

Wow!

Selling stock before the public
knows there's a problem

is one of those thing
that looks suspicious

whether or not you're
actually doing something wrong.

It's like, walking
into a petting zoo,

with a bib on.

What exactly are you planning

-on messily devouring in there?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And Equifax defended
that saying,

none of the executives
in question

including their
Chief Financial Officer

knew about the data breach,
which raises another question,

-"How is that even possible?"
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Did they just ignore emails
with the subject lines,

"Breach!"
"Following up on breach!"

"Where the fuck are you?
Breach, breach, breach!"

And, "Just spoke to you
in person about breach

and you just stared blankly
at me, and then said,

'I'm gonna order
from the salad place.'"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And if you are getting
frustrated already

with this kind of incompetence,

you're gonna need
to pace yourself,

because this story,
gets a lot worse.

Apparently,
there were multiple points

where this hack
could have been prevented

and one of them is incredible,

because Equifax were alerted
by Homeland security,

back in March,

that they needed to fix
a critical vulnerability

in their software.

But as lawmakers discovered
at a recent hearing,

that's not what happened.

There was one person apparently,
who forgot to tell somebody

that they had a piece
of software

that needed to be patched.

Yeah, it is not ideal,

that a company guarding
such valuable information

leaves something that important
down to one person.

It's like finding out
that Chase Bank

has a big red button labeled,
"Lose everyone's money,

and the only thing
stopping anyone from pushing it,

-is Frank."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And look, I love Frank.

I love the guy,
but what if he has to pee?

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

A-- and I want to tell you
that this is an anomaly,

but Equifax has had multiple
headline-grabbing breaches

over the years,

and that is not even counting
smaller incidents like this.

I checked my credit report
the other day

online with Equifax...

That was it, and next thing
I know I have 300 pieces of mail

sittin' in my mailbox.

NEWSCASTER 4: Every single one
 of these is addressed to her,

but they're not hers.

Instead, she got
 other people's credit reports.

Now, names,
 social security numbers,

dates of birth, current
 and previous addresses

bank and loan account numbers,

all stacked up
on a kitchen table in Biddeford.

-(AUDIENCE GROANING)
-Yeah, I mean,

that not great, is it?

And it really should have
set off red flags at Equifax,

when hundreds of different
credit reports

were being mailed
to the same address.

What exactly did you think
had happened there

that every single Fraggle
checks their credit at once,

down at Fraggle Rock?

-Down at Fraggle Rock?
-(AUDIENCE CLAPPING)

-Now-- very nice.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-And--
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And I know that other companies
have had breaches

but none remotely as damaging
as this new Equifax one,

'cause remember,
this isn't Target

exposing
customer's credit cards.

This is compromising
social security numbers

the things that thieves
could use

to open new credit cards
in your name

and if your information
was stolen, which remember,

is about a 50-50 chance,
it could haunt you forever.

You don't change
your birth date,

you don't change your
social security number.

Those who've been, uh,
jeopardized by this hack

will have to protect themselves
 for years, until they're dead.

It's true and just
think about that.

There is only one other thing

that you have to
constantly protect yourself from

until you're dead.

-And that's fucking death!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And you would hope that Equifax
would do a decent job

of mitigating the damage.

After all,

they did have nearly six weeks
to work on a response,

but instead,
their fuck ups continued.

For instance, they created
a website

for concerned consumers
to go to,

but then this happened:

The site that Equifax started
is called Equifax Security 2017.

But a developer named
 Nick Sweeting,

wanted to show,
 how easy it is

to create a similar fake site,
 so he did.

He called it,
 Security Equifax 2017.

(AUDIENCE GROANING)

Exactly, someone created
a fake site

and if you're thinking,
"Well, who would be dumb enough

to fall for that?"

Equifax! That's who!

Because they tweeted links
to that fake site

at least eight times!

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
IN DISBELIEF)

Despite the fact that site had
a couple of tiny clues

that it might be fake
from the headline reading,

"Why did Equifax use a domain

that's so easily impersonated
by phishing sites?"

to the fact that when you
clicked on their
Frequently Asked Questions,

this happened.

♪ ("NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP"
BY RICK ASTLEY PLAYING) ♪

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
AND CHEERING)

Well played pranksters,
you have my respect.

But look, don't worry.

Equifax says that they are
tightening up their operation.

And to see how well
that they've done on that,

You-- you can just go to,
equifaxfraudprevention.com,

not because it's their site
but because it's our site.

We bought it two days ago,

and if you'll go there
you'll find the message,

"How were we still able
to do this?

Why haven't you learned
anything?"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

But wait-- wait!
Because there is even more.

'Cause Equifax
also offered consumers

a year of free credit monitoring

but when people tried to sign-up
for the service,

they noted something.

Guess what? You lock into
Equifax terms of service

-when sign-up for it,
-Ah!

which means that you
can't sue the company.

You've gotta resolve any
disputes in forced arbitration.

Exactly! You'll be giving up
your right to sue.

So legally, your best recourse
at that point would be,

shaking your fist at the heavens
while shouting, "Equifax!"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Now, they-- they've since
rescinded that clause,

although many frustrated people
are now signing up

for third party credit
monitoring services like,

LifeLock, who've been
advertising everywhere.

And they've seen a real surge
in business

in the wake
of this breach, although,

if you're considering LifeLock
because you are mad at Equifax,

there is something
you're gonna need to know.

According to filings
with the SCC,

LifeLock purchases
credit monitoring services from

-Equifax.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

And that means someone buys
credit monitoring

through LifeLock.

LifeLock turns around
and passes some of that revenue

directly along to Equifax.

Is that right Mr. Smith?

That is correct.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
IN DISBELIEF)

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-It's true. Some of--
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

some of the money that you pay
to LifeLock

goes right back
to fucking Equifax,

which could only be
more infuriating

if you then found out that
the rest of it goes

to Toys For Todds.

A charity that purchases
sex toys

-for grown men named Todd.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Buy your own sex toys Todd,
we can't carry you on this one.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And look, Equifax
connections aside,

LifeLock has had
repeated issues itself,

including settlements
with the FTC

and a truly disastrous
ad campaign

a few years back.

I'm Todd Davis,

and I'm here
to prove just how safe

your identity can be
with LifeLock.

That's my real
social security number.

Yeah, LifeLock's then-CEO
Todd Davis,

actually put his real
social security number,

457-55-5462,

on a truck and billboards.

For a time, it was impossible
to escape

his social security number,

-457-55-5462.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

And that was a very cocky move

and one that resulted in him
having his identity stolen

-13 times.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

And I'm guessing,
that the defense

for the people who took it was,

"I didn't steal his identity

I literally got it off
the back of a truck."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-So, to put it mildly,

LifeLock, may not be your
best solution

to the Equifax crisis,
which brings us to the question,

"What is?"

Well, consumer advocates told us

that the one big step
everyone should take,

is to go through all three large
credit reporting companies,

that's Equifax, Experian
and TransUnion,

and freeze your credit.

That way no one can access it,
including you,

until you unfreeze it.

Now the companies also offer

their own credit protection
products,

with names like, Trusted ID

or Credit Lock Plus.

But, they are
often more expensive

and offer fewer
consumer protection.

So, if you need a way
to remember this,

locks, are something
you don't want.

Think of Justin Bieber's
dreadlocks.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-A terrible decision

to be avoided!

Whereas freezes are great.

Uh, think of this tiny penguin
losing its frozen mind.

♪ (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

See! So, to recap,

-locks, oof, freezes, wee!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Now-- now, here is the thing--
here's the thing on this.

Freezing and unfreezing
of your credit can cost money

which will go back to these
companies, because seemingly,

they just can't
fucking lose on this.

And if you need any more
proof of that,

on the very same day

that Congress was yelling at
Equifax's former CEO,

it emerged that the company
had just been awarded

a seven-million-dollar contract
by the IRS, to prevent fraud,

which led one senator to make
a pretty brutal comparison.

You realize, to many Americans
right now, that looks like uh...

we're giving Lindsay "Lohawn"
the keys to the mini bar.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING IN SHOCK,)
APPLAUDING)

I understand your point.

That was the pause of man
thinking, "Do I let that pass?"

"Do I correct him
on how to pronounce Lohan?"

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Or do I double down

and pronounce her name,
"Lingonberry Lahoni Baloney."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And you should know--
you should know

that IRS deal
has been suspended,

not cancelled by the way,
just suspended.

And that might make you angry
but the problem is,

that anger won't have
much impact on Equifax.

Because they make
most of their money

selling our data to businesses,
like banks.

So, in their eyes,

we are not the consumer,
we're the product.

To think of it in terms of KFC.

We are not the guy buying
the ten-piece buckets,

-we're the fucking chickens!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

So, for the time being,

businesses are the only ones
who can exert influence here

and as one colorfully dressed
expert pointed out,

that's not gonna happen
anytime soon.

I haven't heard any big company
came out-- come out yet

and say, "We're not gonna use
Equifax anymore"

-for their credit scores.
-STUART VARNEY: Good point.

So far, everybody's been quiet,

and I don't know what they're
waiting to hear.

This is outrageous,
they should be done

but I bet you,

because it's America,
they'll be okay.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Here's the truth,

that angry business casual
farm animal on Fox Business

-is talking sense.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And that sentence alone
shows just how bad things are.

So, in the long term,

there should clearly be
major reform to this industry

and how it's regulated,

but that is going to take time,
so until then

you need to freeze
your credit reports

with all three
of these companies,

and only unfreeze them

when you need to apply
for credit.

And because the freeze option

can be hard to find
on their sites

if you go to our twitter feed,

we will give you exact links
to do that, and when you do,

they will give you a PIN number
that you need to unfreeze it.

So, do not lose that number,
or at the very least,

make it something memorable.

I don't know, like...

-457-55-5462.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-But not that, 'cause of course

that's Todd Davis's
social security number.

torture it's the thing that happens to

Mel Gibson in all his movies

this little piggy stayed home Wow that

is awful

although I will say the past decade of

Mel Gibson's life has made those clips

slightly more enjoyable to watch sadly

torture is not just something that

happens to Mel Gibson it's also been

practiced by the United States as

President Obama admitted last summer in

a bizarre manner in the immediate

aftermath of 9/11 we did some things

that were wrong we did a whole lot of

things that were right but we tortured

some folks that's a weird way to phrase

that you said what you're quoting a

horrifying Andy Griffith episode you see

Opie things got a little out of hand

down at the jailhouse and Barney and I

well we tortured some folks we tortured

those folks good okay

the president's comments were triggered

by the Senate intelligence committees

massive 6700 page report on the CIA's

detention and interrogation program the

full report remains classified but a 500

page summary was released in December

and it is even actually available on

Amazon and you should get a copy

especially if you're looking for a truly

terrible book club pick because this has

got to be right up there with a lawn

mower repair manual or Bill Cosby's

memoir time flies you know when time

really flies when you lose consciousness

for three hours and wake up in Bill

Cosby's limo but the point is clearly

most people have not read this summary

that's not particularly shocking what is

shocking is that many of those actually

involved in the programs even former

director of the CIA Porter Goss have not

read it either I have not read a word of

the report I have not read a word of any

of this stuff how how have you not read

it you're in it 81 times

spoiler alert buy the story spoiler

alert

you can do it though just knock out a

chapter a night and if you can't find

the time to sit down and read it don't

worry we've made an audiobook version

with Academy award-winning actress Helen

Mirren reading the report for you and

I'm not kidding about that she did it

for us take a listen

the CIA placed individuals with no

applicable experience or training in

senior detention and interrogation roles

yes reading the report that you should

have already read for you Porter Goss so

put it on in your car and King listen to

it and look I know no one no one wants

to read this or talk about what's in it

but there are a few things in here that

we all should really grapple with

because as a recent poll revealed a lot

of us may have some dangerous

misconceptions about torture 69% of

Americans told us they consider

waterboarding to be torture but nearly

half 49% said such tactics are sometimes

justified and more than half 57 percent

said these interrogation techniques

often or sometimes provide reliable

information that can help prevent terror

attacks 57% of us are confident that

torture works that is a lot according to

one poll only 46% of Americans are

confident in the big bang theory which

is crazy because that is literally

explained to us every week in the

opening credits of the big bang thing

and sadly there is no sitcom theme that

explains torture to us at least not

since they canceled two guys a girl and

a black site prison and if you're

thinking why are we talking about this

now didn't we pass a law banning all

those enhanced interrogation techniques

well it turns out no we didn't we

checked and the only restrictions put in

place were by an executive order

President Obama signed in 2009 requiring

interrogations to follow the Army Field

Manual and that's it and executive

orders can be instantly overturned as

soon as the president leaves office and

think about that that means president

Lindsey Graham could undo that on his

first day in office and to be honest

that just seemed like a nice thing to do

for him it he can put that image in a

frame and he can look at it while he's

not being president for the rest of his

life but let let's look at the report

together because it challenges a lot of

the assumptions in that poll first we

did a lot more than just waterboarding

we learned that one CIA officer played

Russian roulette with a detainee another

threatened a detainee with a gun and a

power drill we learned at least five

detainees were subjected to so-called

rectal rehydration or feeding through

the rectum with no medical necessity yes

forced rectal rehydration and the

details of that in a footnote of this

report are so graphic not even Helen

Mirren can make them sound appealing

maajid khan's lunch tray consisting of

hummus pasta with sauce nuts and raisins

was pureed and rectally infused just

trying not to think about that the next

time you eat hummus in fact I feel like

I should preemptively apologize to the

Sabra hummus brands because your sales

are about to drop quite noticeably and

it doesn't stop there the report also

cites the tragic case of ghoul ramen a

completely innocent man picked up in a

case of mistaken identity who was

shackled to the wall of his cell and

later found dead likely from hypothermia

and at this point we could all probably

do with hearing Helen Mirren reading

something a little more pleasant maybe

some Beatrix Potter Flopsy Mopsy and

Cottontail

good little bunnies went down the lane

to gather blackberries Oh Thank You

Helen that's so much nicer please tell

me more about the bunnies

but while Flopsy Mopsy and Cottontail

were on their way to pick blackberries

peter was chained to a wall in Farmer

McGregor's basement

he'd been badly beaten and a tray of

carrots and raisins was pureed and

rectally in fumes about you for years

you're a monster look you may think as

57% of you evidently do then at least

those tough techniques provided us with

reliable intelligence well not so much

the reports most damning conclusion is

that the tactics were ineffective

despite the CIA's claimed at 20

detainees subjected to them shared

crucial information some of which led to

Osama bin Laden

our staff reviewed every one of the 20

cases and not a single case holds up

torture is one of those things that is

advertised to something that works but

doesn't like a Ford truck or all those

weird bottles of horny goat weed

available at your local bodega but but

maybe the reason that so many of us

innately believe that torture works is

because it does on TV all the time look

at 24 Jack Bauer repeatedly saved

American lives while behaving like this

you're gonna tell me what I want to know

you're gonna start losing your fingers

one by one

where

you probably don't think that any forces

towel down your throat trust me I can

Emmy for Best Drama 2006 beat The

Sopranos great show look torture works

on 24 and in movies because it has to

it's a dramatic device to move the plot

along but art terror experts and they'll

tell you it's one of those movie tropes

that's got no basis in real life like a

wedding being interrupted or someone

this handsome feeling sad or or this

character being partisan it works

because they just says it does and we're

supposed to take it and yet even

supposedly smart people like Antonin

Scalia an ill-tempered bullfrog in a

robe they cite 24 as evidence that

torture could be justified he said Jack

Bauer saved Los Angeles he saved

hundreds of thousands of lives is any

jury going to convict Jack Bauer I don't

think so

and look Justice Scalia just because

Kiefer Sutherland does something on

camera does not mean it's a great idea

unless of course that thing is him

drunkenly running into a Christmas tree

explain everything

[Applause]

yes yes on December 25th we should no

longer celebrate the birth of Christ we

should celebrate that look it's clearly

not all 24s fault

some people continue to insist that our

tactics saved lives citing two

particular cases no Karla chick Mohammad

and Abu Zubaydah provided the

overwhelming majority of reports on al

Qaeda both of them were uncooperative at

first the application of enhanced

interrogation techniques specifically

waterboarding especially in the case of

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed it's what really

persuaded him he needed to cooperate

look I know what you're thinking that is

a reasonable statement from a famously

reasonable man but but let's just look

at those two examples first Abu Zubaydah

the CIA of claims that subjecting him to

enhanced interrogation disrupted two

plots but it turns out he disclosed

those plots before he was waterboarded

and the reports now tells us that they

were judged to be infeasible those plots

and in one case hilariously infeasible

because it concerned two would-be

terrorists who had and this is true

proposed a plot based on a satirical

internet article entitled how to make an

h-bomb which instructed people to enrich

uranium by placing it in a bucket

attaching it to a six-foot rope and

swinging it around your head as fast as

possible for 45 minutes and we all know

that is not how to make an h-bomb that

is the brewing process for Bud Light

line

a scientific fact it's how they do it

now hospital shaykh muhammad he did come

he did give us information after he was

waterboarded that's true

but he's worth noting the quality of

that information he told investigators

that he had sent Abu Issa a Brittani to

Montana to recruit african-american

Muslim converts the FBI scrambles

launches a massive investigation in

Montana trying to find these supposed

black al-qaeda operatives but the FBI

found nothing

KSM was lying yeah of course he was

lying what part of the phrase recruiting

african-american Muslims in Montana did

not make you called instantly

even this week we've learned that the

most famous black person from Montana

may actually be white none of this is to

say that we don't need information from

detainees but if you want to see how to

get it without torture just watch a

former FBI agents Jack Cloonan who

worked in the bin Laden unit show you

how it's done you want to be able to

build a rapport with somebody you are

their salvation because their life as

they know it is over

something I can do for your kids you

concerned about them you want the magic

kid I'll get them educated what do you

want tell me what you want scrip for me

your exit strategy how do you extricate

yourself from this terrible situation by

the way that you put yourself in now you

can't go back home Kenyon no so let's

make peace with that let me help you

find this strategy to give you a life

holy I would tell that man any of

my secrets the fun name I have my

glasses is fixing mcpeepers I want to

try to bleach my anus with Crest

Whitestrips

every day at 2:00 p.m. I cheer myself up

by silently eating four marshmallows

from the back at my desk and I call it a

marshmallow party please stop looking at

me I'll tell you anything so look there

is no proof that torture does any good

but there is real proof that it has

serious harm to America's image overseas

references to American torture show up

everywhere from terrorist recruiting

tools to statements from North Korea who

have called our techniques brutal

medieval and the most insulting thing

about that is that knowing them they

probably meant it as a compliment and

the problem is the rules we have on the

books to stop us from returning to the

dark days of torture are in one easily

reversible executive order now as it

happens John McCain and Diane Feinstein

have proposed an amendment you up for a

vote next week which puts the most basic

parts of the president's executive order

into actual law and we should pass that

because if we don't there is no

guarantee that the next president will

uphold the ban in fact we asked all

fourteen declared candidates whether

they would consider overturning the

president's order and only four of them

told us definitively that they would

definitely keep it in place as for the

rest they either ignored us or avoided

answering directly which is very

frustrating because we need that

information badly from them and the

problem is we can't torture them to get

it because as this report more than

proves that doesn't work

here's the thing if enhanced

interrogation were not torture which it

is and even if torture did work which it

doesn't America should not be a country

that tortures people because it is

brutal

it is medieval and it is beneath us and

when the rest of the world thinks about

America they should not think of this

because that's not what this country is

about they should be thinking about this

[Applause]

Christmas tree

[Applause]

you

school

if Pink Floyd had gone to one they'd

have known its we don't need any

education you undermined your point now

it is it's currently back-to-school

season and for millions the school

they'll be attending will be a charter

school the things the politicians love

to praise I called for a doubling of our

investment in charter schools I'm a big

believer in charter schools

I believe in public Trotta schools

charter schools work and they work very

well charter schools are so successful

that almost every politician can find

something good to say about them yes

Seana schools unite both sides of the

aisle more quickly than when a wedding

DJ throws on hay yah oh look at Nana

dancing we can never let her know what

this song is about charters are

basically public schools that the

taxpayer funded but privately run and

now the first ones in most 25 years ago

as places to experiment with new

educational approaches and since then

they've exploded there are now over 6700

charter schools educating almost 3

million students and some have celebrity

backers like Puff Daddy Andre Agassi and

even pitbull who helps helped launch

Miami's slam Academy he was a keynote

speaker at a charter school conference

in 2013 and his speech has not aged well

for reasons that all become painfully

clear they told me that uh Bill Cosby

has spoken here before which i think is

amazing someone that I really relate to

I also love jello you know yes yes that

does look bad now but to be fair it was

not commonly known at the time that

jello was responsible for dozens of

cases of sexual assault turns out jello

is a monster I think I'm legally okay to

say that

the point is jello and and look when

pitbull has a charter school it seems

like it might be worth taking a look at

them and first let me acknowledge this

is a controversial area charter

proponents will point to positive news

stories like this one about the Kipp

charter schools network most Kipp

students are chosen by lottery

regardless of prior academic record

almost all meet federal poverty guy

lines and yet 82% go on to college I

think one thing that I learned that Kipp

really well is that a lot of your effort

doesn't reap any success until way later

in the future now honestly any

philosophy that can get those kind of

results might be worth considering in

the same way that if we found out they

boosted our immunity

we'd seriously consider eating koalas

but but critics critics argue charters

overstate their successes siphon off

talented students and divert precious

resources within a school district now

for this piece and I know this is going

to make some people on both sides very

angry we're going to set aside whether

or not charter schools are a good idea

in principle because whether they are or

not in 42 states and DC we're doing them

so instead we're going to look at how

they operate in practice one group found

on average charters have a slight edge

over traditional public schools in

reading indeed about the same in math

but acknowledged charter quality is

uneven across the states and across

schools and that is putting it mildly

because around the country there have

been charter schools so flawed they

don't make it through the school year

this charter school suddenly closed its

doors in the middle of the day in Orange

County charter schools suddenly closed

its doors without notice the local

charter school is suddenly and

unexpectedly closing its doors on our

dining room table my son left these two

notes to us one says dear mom is the

school going out of business yes yes you

are right

that kid spelled business business which

I'd argue is a much better way to spell

it now that that school was actually

shut down just six weeks into the school

year so to be honest they probably

should have been much better at business

and charters in some states can have an

alarming failure rate two years ago a

Florida paper found that since 2008 a

hundred and nineteen charter schools had

closed there fourteen of which had never

even finished their first school year so

fourteen schools in Florida were

outlasted by nbc's mysteries of laura a

show which once ended an episode like

this i have a hot date tonight

who threesome actually

but a threesome joke about of king

children it was in the first season and

they gave her another one and the point

is when schools closed that fast

it's shocking because you would assume

someone would rigorously screen a school

before it was allowed to open making

sure it was financially and academically

sound but that is not always the case

take forwarders ruv academies which shut

down after just seven weeks due to a

lack of among other things a school the

schools were repeatedly kicked out of

their buildings shuttled students among

multiple sites including the signature

grand reception hall in Davie

two local churches in Fort Lauderdale

and holiday park

they also bus students on Daley field

trips because they didn't have enough

classrooms Daley field trips how's that

even possible

surely by day ten you've run out of

ideas and they're taking kids to

Marshalls to return a belt hey pretty

pretty great right kids

I'll probably get store credit so put on

your adventure hats we're about to go on

a magical twelve dollar scavenger hunt

so how did those schools get approved

well Florida's charter process begins

with a lengthy application and Ivy

Academy's was four hundred pages long

and their founder Trayvon Mitchell

included passages like this one

beginning instruction is scaffolded to

provide targeted support with the goal

of increasing independence it goes on

and it sounds great but weirdly we found

this application by a school called

Franklin Academy in Fort Lauderdale

which predates that by two years and

which features this passage which begins

instruction will scaffold and then

continues in almost exactly the same way

it's basically identical but for a few

small differences like the Olsen twins I

mean you know you know one of them came

first and then Mary Kate plagiarized her

face

now that behavior might not be illegal

but it's certainly unethical or if I

make once from the IV Academy handbook

you will not plagiarize works that you

find on the Internet plagiarism is

taking the ideas or writings of others

and presenting them as if they were

yours so the application for Mitchel

school would also have been grounds for

him getting thrown out of that school

and incidentally that's not the only

thing he may have stolen he has since

been accused of spending funds for

students on himself and is awaiting

trial for grand theft and the problem

with the approval process being to

Easy's there is a lot at stake in

charter schools they get paid on a per

student basis on average that's about

seven thousand dollars for every

enrollment and that adds up take

Philadelphia's Harambee charter school I

know I know they named it a long time

ago and it's spelled differently your

king monsters rest in peace now that's

gone that's gone received more than five

million dollars in taxpayer money at the

same year that this story emerged by day

the Harambee Institute charter school

looks like any other educating some 450

students from kindergarten through

eighth grade but by night the cafeteria

turns into club domani

a bar that authorities say is unlicensed

and illegal oh wow a nightclub in an

elementary school is a recipe for

disaster because those are the two most

vomit prong populations in the world

they must've had to Febreze the out

of that place now you'll be glad to hear

that that schools under new leadership

now although that might be because its

CEO pled guilty to fraud for embezzling

nearly 80 thousand dollars from the

Harambee Institute rest in peace and and

look you can say that's an isolated

incident but it isn't in Philadelphia

alone at least 10 executives or top

administrators have pled guilty in the

last decade to charges like fraud

misusing funds and obstruction of

justice which may be why Philly magazine

advises parents don't forget to Google

any schools you're looking at to make

sure they won't once unexpectedly shut

down or run by a CEO who pleaded guilty

to theft all of which speaks to a

general atmosphere perhaps best

articulated by the state auditor I said

it before and I will say it again

Pennsylvania has the worst charter

school in the United States that is not

good because it is not like having the

worst something is new for Pennsylvania

remember this is a state that has the

worst football fans the worst Bell and

the worst regional delicacy yes if I

wanted Cheez Whiz on my steak sandwich I

need a kiddy cafeteria the restaurant

run by six-year-olds and and I'm not

even sure Pennsylvania deserves to be

called the worst because

Ohio's charter law was for decades so

lacks even charter advocates have called

it the Wild West

the state has around 360 charters and

their Governor John Kasich

speaks often about how much he loves

choice and competition in schools we

will improve the public schools if

there's a sense of competition it's just

like a pizza shop in the town if there's

only one and and there's not much

pepperoni on it you can call til you're

blue in the face but the best way to get

pepperoni on more pepperoni on that

pizza is to open up a second pizza shop

and that's what's going to improve our

public schools

okay okay that doesn't work on any level

first no one has ever called it a pizza

shop second it's a little hard to hear

the man who just defunded Planned

Parenthood talked about the importance

of choice third there's such a thing

there is such a thing as paying for

extra pepperoni like a normal person

and finally the notion that the more

pizza shops there are the better pizza

becomes is effectively undercut by the

two words Papa John's but but Ohio's

charters have had huge problems with

lack of oversight a review of one year's

state audits found charters misspent

public money nearly four times more

often than any other form of

taxpayer-funded agency and some cases

are incredible like that of Lisa ham a

school superintendent who was accused of

spending money for her school on sparse

jewelry luggage plays Vetri care and

trips to Europe and to see Oprah she

took a plea deal without admitting guilt

but not before delivering this fantastic

explanation proverbs says without vision

people perish and it's very important

for people to have a vision for their

own lives and in order to do that they

need to experience what's possible in

life and in order to transfer that to

the children they have to experience it

themselves that is amazing

she's just spouting a bunch of vague

about inspiration crossing her

fingers and hoping people will buy it

and you know what when you put it like

that I feel like she has learned a lot

from Oprah money well-spent and it's

Nellie for the record when she quoted

proverb saying where there is no vision

the people perish she's leaving out the

very next line which is but he that

keepeth the law happy is he and that's a

king important caveat

and what's crazy is there are ways to

profit off of charter schools perfectly

legally in Ohio and there have been for

years

look at this episode of frontline from

2000 by law

charter schools must be nonprofit but

the schools can hire an educational

management company or a mo to run the

school and the e mo can try to make a

profit

Brennan calls his e mo white hat

management education is first last and

always a business if it's run like a

business it can be done profitably yes

education is first last and always a

business take the L off the word

learning and what do you got earning

take the e off it what do you got then

arning yeah sure that's not a word but

it could be in one of our English

classes now that man's company white hat

management worked on two contracts where

each charter would pay ninety five

percent or more of its government

funding to white hats which as a private

company isn't obligated to provide the

same level of transparency as say a

school district so taxpayers could have

little idea how that money was being

spent and who can say if that's a good

system or not all I know is white hat

ran thirty two of the lowest performing

schools in the state and if you do

essentially the same terrible thing more

than 30 times in a row you're not a

management company

you basically Billy Joel's Greatest Hits

volumes two and three and at this point

you may be thinking charters were

completely unmonitored but that is where

you would actually be wrong because they

are approved and overseen by what are

called authorizes and while some states

sharply limit who can be an authorizer

Ohio allowed many different groups

including nonprofits to do it meaning

well let's say I wanted to open the John

Oliver Academy for nervous boys

and let's say I had a pre-existing

nonprofit called Johnny's kids that

could potentially have overseen my

school and that basically happened

take the Richard Allen chain of schools

in Ohio whose president was a woman

called Jeannette Harris

they were overseen by Kids Count a

non-profit founded by Jeannette Harris

which oversaw the schools as they spent

a million tax dollars on management and

consulting firms founded by wait for it

Jeannette King Harris now Harris denies

a conflict of interest because she

claims she wasn't directly involved in

decision-making and maybe maybe the

school's just chose Kids Count because

it had a proven track record of great

oversight so let's let's just check in

on one of the other schools they oversaw

a local charter school padded its

attendance records resulting in more

than a million dollars in extra money

state auditors interviewed students and

staff their findings show that on any

given day there would only be about 30

students in the building a fraction of

the reported 459 enrolled there oh it

gets worse because when an auditor

looked into it they found Kids Count had

done the legal minimum oversight

required which I would argue suggests a

problem with the legal minimum because

thirty kids showed up and the school

claims they had four hundred and fifty

which doesn't speak well of an oversight

group calling itself Kids Count now

though oh hi oh has passed a new law to

try and clean up some of the problems

you've seen but serious damage has

already been done and incredibly there

is one more way that charter schools

around the country have been allowed to

run wild because we haven't even

mentioned online charters yet they serve

a hundred eighty thousand students and

even if they just get the average seven

thousand dollars per student that's over

a billion dollars in taxpayer money

going to cyber charters annually and

some have an attendant system you would

not believe sometimes kids aren't

counted absent until they have failed to

log on for five days in a row

and some are never required to attend

class but the state still requires the

schools to report attendance so most

just report a hundred percent even

though that's

not what's really going on that's just

crazy you're basically giving kids a box

containing videogames pornography and

long division and claiming a hundred

percent of them chose the right one and

look some kids might need online

education but it has got to be monitored

better because one major study found

compared to kids in traditional public

schools students in online charters lost

the equivalent of 72 days of learning

and reading and 180 days in math during

the course of a 180 day school year and

180 - 180 is as those kids might put it

three now

charter advocates will tell you that

even they are concerned about online

schools and they'll argue some states

have much better oversight than the ones

that we've seen and that is true though

for the record some may even be worse

once you're a researcher told Ohio be

very glad that you have Nevada so you

are not the worst which I believe is the

motto on Nevada state licensed place but

the point is we don't even have time to

get into Nevada and advocates will argue

all these closings shall accountability

inaction just like in business bad

schools closed but there's a king

problem there as one former charter

school employee explains this isn't just

a regular business this isn't a

restaurant that you just open up you

serve your food people don't like it you

close it and you move on this is

Education this is students are getting

left in the middle of the year without a

school to go to so I just think that

there needs to be some filter as to

who's opening up these charter schools

exactly the problem with letting the

free market decide when it comes to kids

is that kids change faster than the

market and by the time it's obvious the

school is failing futures may have been

ruined so if we are going to treat

charter schools like pizza shops we

should monitor them at least as well as

we do pizzerias it's like the old saying

give a kid a shitty pizza you've got

their day treat a kid like a shitty

pizza you could cut their entire life

you

we'd like to talk about someone you may

not have thought about for a while the

Dalai Lama a man so enlightened he's

basically the original woke bei

according to a Gallup poll the Dalai

Lama is actually the sixth most admired

man in America and when you mentioned

his name to people in the streets

you can see how widely he's revered a

lot of respect inspiration from what he

says he says like Bloodgood quotes

here's some really great quotes about

life a lot of good things I guess he's a

peaceful man he's about peace okay so

he's peaceful admired and has some good

quotes that is pretty broad they could

be describing either the Dalai Lama or

Matthew McConaughey but what what

happens when those same people are asked

a simple follow-up what would you say

the guy

now I have no idea I'm not even alive I

don't know II just I'm not really sure

he's a very important figure for a

Buddhist God right no not a God he's a

better person he's a life he just said

oh like he owes the Dalai Lama

money he's alive oh I got to

disappear for a while that guy does not

around now the Chinese government

however have a very different view

because instead of vaguely loving the

Dalai Lama they very specifically hate

him they've referred to him as a wolf in

monk's robes and have banned his image

they've even retaliated against

Americans for even meeting with him

Britain's Guardian says China reportedly

banned Lady gaga

that's because she met with the Dalai

Lama in Indianapolis to discuss yoga Wow

not only is it incredible that they

banned her for that it's incredible that

that event happened at all Lady Gaga was

with the Dalai Lama in Indianapolis

discussing yoga that is only slightly

less ridiculous than Elton John meeting

ben bernanke on Easter Island to talk

about rumors now the Chinese

government's hatred of the Dalai Lama

stems from its desire to main control of

Tibet a region in southwest China and

Tibet was something of a celebrity cause

in the 1990s there were Tibetan freedom

concerts between the Beastie Boys and

Richard Gere even brought it up at the

Oscars that was when it was this kind of

if something miraculous and really kind

of movie like could happen here where we

could all kind of send love and and

truth and kind of sanity did Deng

Xiaoping right now in Beijing that he

will take his troops and take the

Chinese away from Tibet and allow these

people to live as free independent

people again

so but you send this thoughts send this

thought out send this thought we send

this thoughts we send it out right now

oh you know what I'm sorry there's been

a mistake the thoughts are actually

supposed to be sent to the producers of

moon lights this is not a joke

moon lights these thoughts are for you

[Applause]

take the thoughts but but there is a lot

about Tibet that you might not actually

know for a start it's larger than you

probably think

China say it's this area but Tibetan

exiles will say it's even larger

encompassing an area that is roughly a

quarter of China so it's very big in a

confusing way at which and this is true

is also how director Lars von Trier

characterized Willem Dafoe's dick

seriously he told reporters it's too big

everybody got very confused when they

saw it well I'm saying yes Tibet is the

Willem Dafoe's dick of planet Earth it

is surprisingly large the point is China

invaded Tibet in 1950 and ever since

they've imposed strict controls on the

institutions of Tibetan Buddhism their

temples and monasteries have been

destroyed and hundreds of thousands of

Tibetans have been killed and things

inside Tibet are still grim when Freedom

House scored countries and territories

for political rights and civil liberties

Tibet came in second worst behind Syria

and ahead of both Somalia and North

Korea the whole territory is a gross

human rights violation which is

interestingly another way that lars von

trier has described Willem Dafoe's penis

and perhaps the clearest sign of just

how bad conditions are is the fact that

since early 2009 a hundred and forty-six

Tibetans have self-immolated in Tibet

and China setting themselves on fire in

protest to which the Chinese police have

been less than sympathetic

[Music]

when the O'Laughlin German was on fire

Chinese producer came and he caught him

and bit him because Los Angeles on the

fires so the police closer you got on

fire so letters the police are demanding

the family to Los Angeles a family that

they needed a compensation for burning

of their own clothes well every part of

that is horrifying and China is

unlikely to loosen its grip on the

region Tibet has incredibly rich

resources from gold and lithium to River

supplying hydroelectric power and water

to over a billion people so they are

very sensitive to any perceived threat

to their control which brings us back to

the Dalai Lama traditionally he's been

both a spiritual and political leader of

Tibetan Buddhist sort of a cross between

a Pope and a president a pope Siddhant

if you will but you shouldn't so please

don't China has done everything they can

over the years to diminish his power he

even fled Tibet in 1959 under fear of

arrest and he hasn't been back since an

escape that was reported at the time by

the most British man who has ever lived

the young Dalai Lama revered by his

people as a living Buddha was reported

under arrest by the Rebbe's

but according to other sources is safely

in hiding one clear effect rebbe tyranny

is not wanted by these intensely

religious people

yes damn that unwanted creepy birds

tyranny down with those thieving

imperialists and goodnight to Her

Majesty's subjects in Bahrain Maltese

Rhodesia to make a Barbados Kenya and

Uganda

nighty night sleepy tight

for over fifty years

the Dalai Lama has lived in exile in

India and he's lived quite a life he's

met with the last four presidents and

when he was a child FDR gave him a

beautiful Patek Phillipe pocket watch

which he still has to this day and

George W Bush gave him an even greater

gift but painting his portrait these

portraits and I gave Bush his skills as

noticed the same review I give his time

as president not bad for a five-year-old

now

the dalai lama officially stepped down

from running the Tibetan

government-in-exile in 2011 but he's

still have profound importance to the

Tibetan people as a spiritual leader and

a figurehead and here here is where this

story gets absolutely amazing because

he's 81 years old so thoughts have

inevitably turned to his next

reincarnation but it turns out there's a

bit of a problem with that and let me

explain broadly speaking when the dalai

lama dies he reincarnates as a child

somewhere on earth and traditionally a

key person in the process of finding him

is someone called the panchen lama and

when the Panchen Lama dies the dalai

lama plays a similar role in finding him

and so on and so on

they're basically playing a buddhist

version of hide and seek

so the ninth panchen lama helped

identify the current Dalai Lama who in

turn identified this six year old boy as

the Panchen Lama but this is where it

starts to get tricky because that boy

has not been seen in more than 20 years

these are the last known pictures of

GERD and choking Nima the boy chosen to

be Panchen Lama the Chinese authorities

rejected his appointment arrested the

boy and his family it's true China

kidnapped a six-year-old and no one has

heard from him since although just two

years ago a senior Chinese official said

he is being educated living a normal

life growing up healthily and does not

wish to be disturbed which is a little

suspicious because it sounds like the

kind of thing a former child stars

publicist would scream into a phone

she's growing up healthy living a normal

life and those track marks on her arms

are just where they inject the vitamins

she's

she's fine but Jonah didn't stop it just

stealing the Panchen Lama if I had

another trick up their sleeve in an

attempt to discredit the Dalai Lama's

choice of one of tibet's top Buddhist

spiritual leaders Chinese officials used

a 200 year old ceremony to name their

own Pancham Lama

yes they made their own fake Panchen

Lama they basically counterfeited a

religious leader like a knockoff handbag

that doesn't say coach that says cough

and China's tactics here are obvious if

they control the Panchen Lama they can

use him to pick a new Dalai Lama who

might completely coincidentally be very

favorable to the Chinese government

meanwhile the Dalai Lama understandably

is pretty pissed off about this the

landing no I want to make clear there as

far as my own rebirth is concerned the

final authority is myself no one else

but obviously not Chinese colonists that

is some forceful language - he's

basically saying they can make that

decision over my dead body

except you know specifically not that

he's now actually saying that he will

either not reincarnate as the Dalai Lama

at all or if he does it won't be inside

Chinese control Tibet it will be

somewhere else which is incredible

because that means that when he dies we

could plausibly wind up with two rival

Dalai Lama's and the already fraught

situation in Tibet could spiral out of

control and for the time being there is

really only one person who can fill you

in on what is happening in the Dalai

Lama's head but he lives in India and

that is a 14 hour flight away and the

reason I know that is I went to speak to

the Dalai Lama in India enjoy

yes I travel to the Himalayan foothills

of Dharamsala India a journey that

involved considerably more uphill

walking cows and monkey traffic than

I've been led to believe all to talk

with the Dalai Lama about China

conditions in Tibet and what comes next

for him

you holiness it isn't honor to speak to

you may I say Tashi Delek

thank you how is my pronunciation - I

think we're good in my defense I just

started learning Tibetan 40 seconds ago

let's talk about China because the

Chinese government absolutely hates you

don't they yes publicly one government

official said you're a wolf wrapped in

monk's robes and photos of you are

forbidden in many places you don't to me

look like an evil wolf they just called

me sa demon you're a demon oh yeah then

I immediately yes I am demon with horns

yeah because that's the classic demon

right yes I think that's what I look at

you that's what they see oh why don't I

do one to say that's their freedom I

have no say no negative feeling I just

feel a laugh like that I practice you

see taking others anger suspicion

distrust and give them patience

tolerance and compassion I practiced

that but it seems the Chinese government

are particularly good at taking your

positivity turning it back into

negativity and oppression of the Tibetan

people they hand it back to you as it

was yes just outside the dalai lama's

temple is a local memorial honoring

Tibetans who self-immolated in protest

against Chinese oppression acts that put

him in a very difficult position this is

a hard question

well the self-immolation that has

happened or a hundred and forty Tibetans

yes

burned themselves it is very very sad

indeed yes why is it hard for you to

definitively tell them to stop doing it

this is I find a very difficult sort of

situation there right from the beginning

when I first heard that firstly i

express my solo or sadness then meantime

if I say their action is wrong then

their family they will they feel very

sad

what would our family member did

something against Inter Lamas wish right

I don't want to create that and then

certainly I cannot support that because

of the act of killing from Buddhist

viewpoint it's a self killing not good

so therefore my position is very very

difficult

so then best thing is remain silence to

quite the tango Lama is Priene fully

aware how powerful his words are and he

occasionally uses them in targeted and

sometimes surprisingly specific ways

like this example which he offered up

out of nowhere one will my previous

visit Mongolia is it they took lot of

vodka the Russians were hard ferocity

they like a drink yeah vodka then I

suggested drink much less vodka yeah I

love to hear instead of that you say

dead traditional drink horse milk wait

hold on hold me what you tried to wean

them off vodka by giving them horse milk

oh yes

then they follow what they really follow

since then say I think majority of

Mongolian no longer any drink hold on

that is a that is a huge claim you cured

Mongolia of alcoholism yes using horse

milk yes yeah not too late but the point

I'm just concerned I would see horse

milk and I think oh that came from a

horse

oh that's illogical once differences cow

milk and hospital one differences one

comes out of a cow the other I don't

know how you get it out of a horse I

know you just how to keep the party

going let's talk about a lighter subject

death you are going to die and when you

do it's going to be a massive problem

because there are issues regarding your

reincarnation regarding China I I do not

much done son what that by being cousin

is well-being of seven billion human

being and then preservation of rich

Buddhist tradition but which we kept but

you're intertwined with that no no it's

an individual person not much important

you know right but there is a loyal um

but Buddhism over two thousand since

early years still very much alike so do

you think you might be the last Dalai

Lama very possible you do yes you might

be if I become last dollar I feel very

happy what because you were a good one

oh yes I may say quite intelligent

oh you calling yourself intelligent so a

little bit of arrogance there as well if

you don't resolve your reincarnation

issue are you not worried that China

will appoint their own Dalai Lama and he

may not speak like you're speaking now

that also it may I say so yeah there's

also you see one of the foolish and

short-sighted China without using human

brain properly it's harmful that's that

is a guaranteed way to calm the Chinese

government down to tell them they're not

using the human brain properly I told

them our brain usually you see have the

ability to create common sense the

Chinese hardliners in their brain that

one brain is missing Z Chinese leaders

Chinese Communists they're very much

concerned about the image of China I'm

happy to sit here and criticize China

with you because I know the consequences

for me are not necessarily as bad as

they are for you so so I wish you see

they call me demon so I want another

demon so you become demon no no no you

can't transfer you can't reincarnate the

demon into me you cannot do that you

don't only do that SN de geneve Z oh no

this is not how I wanted this interview

today

so the Dalai Lama seems determined to

keep his reincarnation plans private for

the time being

leaving millions of Tibetans waiting for

an answer and as our time drew to a

close I wanted to cement our new

friendship you were given a watch by

President Roosevelt is that true yes

true at that time I think one cursor

better flip that's actually a beautiful

one pocket pocket watch right well I

have a special gift for you it is not a

beautiful watch from a president but it

is a special watch from me here it is

it's a calculator watch oh right

Roosevelt might have given you a fancy

watch but that is water-resistant

wonderful thank you Rosalie rosewood

watch I did old fashioned yeah this new

fashion well not so much new fashioned

as from the 1980s okay thank you

thank you think about thank you my demon

friend

[Laughter]

[Applause]

[Music]

our main story tonight concerns Facebook

the worst place to wish happy birthday

to a friend other than a funeral now

Facebook has been in the news a lot

recently over concerns about everything

from privacy to fake news to Russian

trolls but tonight we're actually going

to go in a different direction and focus

on his behavior overseas because

Facebook has been expanding aggressively

abroad more than half its revenue come

from outside the US and eighty percent

of its users now live in foreign

countries posting things like this yes

that is that's an international version

of the in my feelings challenge the

thing that took Facebook and Instagram

by storm after being popularized by the

Shiggy show and you can learn more about

all of that in my new book I don't know

what any of these words mean but my

staff assures me it makes sense for

years Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg

pushed his utopian idea that all

connections are good connections with

feel-good ads showing him bringing the

Internet to the world and Facebook

employees proudly saying things like

this by connecting the world people

realize that there are other people in

the world who have different lives in

them and that maybe their lives could be

better and then amazing things happen

you want to do something big and you

have this access to you know 1.2 billion

people what can you do is just limited

by your imagination look connecting

billions of people does sound great but

it's also important to remember that

when it comes to the Internet a certain

number of those people are then going to

say Jews control sharks who did 9/11 and

you really have to think that through

unfortunately thinking things through

has never really been Facebook strong

point there early motto was famously

move fast and break things a sentiment

which Zuckerberg has explained this way

we want to build our culture and our

infrastructure so that we just try to

move you know one or two clicks faster

than than other companies and you know

sometimes we go too fast and we mess up

a bunch of stuff and then we have to fix

it and that's cool is that cool is that

cool at all mark because that seems like

maybe the most reckless corporate motto

since the hindenburg companies fly fast

and smokes

and a big bag of hydrogen how did you

not foresee the problems that were

heading your way and make no mistake

Facebook has broken things overseas

sometimes they were small for instance

over the summer there was an earthquake

in Indonesia and while Facebook

undeniably connected people there it

wasn't necessarily in the way the

situation demanded as this international

news report shows normally Facebook

sends the balloon and the confetti

animations to users wishing each other

well however the Indonesian work for

congratulations selamat can also mean

unheard or to survive so when Facebook

users posted messages saying I hope

people will survive Facebook give them

celebratory animations yeah that's not

ideal is it because there's a time and a

place for balloons and it's very rarely

after the word survived in fact let me

prove that to you I have some terrible

news

we may have to eat each other to survive

no that's the worst time for that and

look look if if embarrasing

mistranslations were the only problems

that Facebook had that would be one

thing but the company has made some

hugely consequential mistakes overseas

and that is what tonight's story is

about in the Philippines and Cambodia

Facebook has been accused of empowering

authoritarians in Sri Lanka India and

Indonesia viral rumors and hateful

comments on Facebook have been linked to

outbreaks of deadly violence but for the

worst distillation of what Facebook can

do to a country just look at Myanmar the

country who thinks so little about you

didn't even realize that's not Myanmar

that's Mikhail Gorbachev's birthmark

this is Myanmar now Myanmar

also known as Burma was for decades cut

off from the world under military

dictatorships but in recent years as its

transition to a quasi civilian

government internet use there especially

a Facebook has exploded in 2013 just

over 1 percent of citizens had internet

access but now 18 million people are on

Facebook thanks in part to becoming

pre-installed on mobile phones and heavy

promotion by service providers who

didn't charge Facebook usage against

data plans yeah we can use Facebook for

free except for looking at photos and

watching videos everything is free we'll

use Facebook for free and ask the things

we want to know I'll use empty tea and

post everything to Facebook it's free

let's use Facebook for free with an PC

okay just quick question is Facebook

free cuz I'm worried that commercial

didn't quite make it clear so with

Facebook so easy to access it basically

became the internet so much so that

people in Myanmar use the terms internet

and Facebook interchangeably and look

some people there use Facebook for fun

that guy you saw earlier lives in

Myanmar while other people find it to be

a complete waste of time like this

irritating teacher everybody said easy

it's my phone playing games I hate I

hate I don't like it's a terrible look

likes boys Facebook is a toilet

pinenut okay I get that he's annoyed but

calling Facebook a toilet is a little

unfair to toilets because they make

go away whereas Facebook retains to

simulate your acquaintances and

reminds you have from seven years

ago or what allowing corporations to put

their in front of you what I'm

saying is there is a purity and

integrity to toilets that Facebook

seriously lacks but Facebook's issues in

Myanmar go well beyond distracted

teenagers because if you have glanced at

the not Trump section of the newspaper

at all recently you are probably aware

that Myanmar is a majority Buddhist

country with a long history of religious

and ethnic tensions particularly with

regard to the row hinge er a mostly

Muslim group in the western part of

Myanmar in 2017 and military executed a

brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing so

far about seven hundred and twenty-five

thousand role hinge about three quarters

of the population have fled to

Bangladesh to escape government troops

one estimate puts the death toll

conservatively at around 10,000 people

and to be clear Facebook didn't cause

that I feel comfortable saying it Mark

Zuckerberg not guilty together side in

Myanmar as of this taping but but and it

is a big but by all accounts Facebook

absolutely did inflame pre-existing

tensions there in fact a report on

Myanmar prepared by independent UN

investigators said Facebook has been a

useful instrument for those seeking to

spread hate and it is weird to hear

something that started out as frivolous

be described like that it's like if five

years from now you and investigators

called bubble tea and aggressive threat

to human rights holy I mean

honestly I never really liked it but

Jesus Christ

but hate speech against Muslims and

especially the brow hinge er flourished

on Facebook posted by military leaders

and politicians as well as prominent

Buddhist monks like Ashton were our two

- Muslims have a place here in Burma we

can't repeat his actual response its

r-rated but essentially he said Muslims

were defecating on Burma threatening its

very existence you don't like them very

much

image Ionian I don't accept them why -

because they're deceiving the world they

want to take over the whole country that

monk is so hateful he has actually been

called the Burmese bin Laden that's

right a Buddhist monk is known as the

Burmese bin Laden which is as jarring as

if you found out there's a Care Bear

known as the one who has to be

honest I always thought wish bear would

be the one who I mean look at it

that Beth Fox

lerato had hundreds of thousands of

followers on Facebook and he uses pages

to wreak havoc including spreading false

accusations that a Muslim business owner

had raped a buddhist employee a post

that helped instigate riots in the city

of mandalay in 2014 in which two people

were killed and around 20 others injured

and yet despite repeated warnings about

where our two facebook didn't get around

to banning him until earlier this year

and that is just one example of the

extent to which facebook became an echo

chamber of Islamophobia one local

official told reporters he was proud to

oversee a Muslim free village even

though he admitted he had never even met

a Muslim before adding I have to thank

Facebook because it is giving me the

true information in Myanmar and here is

what happened when ABC talked to people

in the streets there most local people

here get their news via Facebook and

judging by what people have told us they

are not getting the whole picture what

do you think about the

I think they are terrorists they are

they're making problems every time I

could gather information from Facebook

what does Facebook say they want to

occupy our land and our people that is

very very dangerous because no one

should be judged by the worst things

people say about them on Facebook

if I were judgment that you'd think I

was a cuck twit a prime example of why

abortion should be more readily

available and that I look like a

distressed bird in a pet shop trying

desperately to get your attention and I

ask you is any of that apart from that

last one really fair I would say no I

would argue not so so how the did

so much hate speech and violence

inciting content stay up for so long

because it's not like Facebook doesn't

have rules they have a lot of them their

own internal materials get into details

like which sort of anuses photoshopped

onto faces they're willing to allow this

is true they even cite graphic examples

such as this image of Trump with an anus

for a mouth that is apparently allowed

by the way because he is a public figure

Taylor Swift with anuses for eyes also

allowed for the same reason but this

image of kim jeong-hoon with an anus for

a mouth is apparently not okay because i

quote it also displays a sex toy

inserted into the anus but that still

leaves gray areas doesn't it for

instance what if I display a meatball

sub being inserted into that same mouths

anus is a meatball sub a sex toy could

you not argue that meatballs are the

anal beads of Italy and by the way Olive

Garden that slogan is free for you to

use

look you can have it it's yours and look

you can quibble you've been absolutely

quibble with where Facebook draws its

lines and the broader discussion of

private companies policing speech is an

important one but the point is Facebook

does have standards that are enforced in

a number of ways they have artificial

intelligence that automatically detects

some objectionable content and removes

it that they also rely on users like you

and me to flag objectionable content

which is then reviewed by human

moderators is something most social

media companies do and it is a thankless

job as you can see from this training

session run by a Content moderation

company in India here the person is not

naked but you can see their exxor shape

is visible now this lady's now here it's

very much obvious that intensely sees

focusing on but part the camera is

focusing on backpack it will fall under

nudity it's not proper nudity but it

will fall under nudity I'm sorry I'm

absolutely calling it that guy is

definitely focusing on the buttocks look

but as Facebook themselves will tell you

policing nudity is the easy part

what's harder is defining and spotting

misinformation hate speech and that is

what Myanmar has been drowning in and

Facebook system failed them at every

stage first they're AI didn't work

because Facebook's technology isn't

compatible with me and Mars Language

fonts which you know not great but fine

that just meant that they badly needed

Burmese people to flag content for them

but to do that it really might have

helped if things like their community

standards and reporting systems had been

in Burmese which they weren't until late

2015 which isn't great in the country

where almost no one speaks English just

imagine if Facebook Facebook's interface

here was in Burmese you would have no

way of knowing which button did was in

fact that's not even Facebook's

interface that's just a list of

dinosaurs ranked from most to least

and by the way Stegosaurus is

way too far down on that list

Stella Soros is basically the wish bear

of dinosaurs seriously that bear can get

it but but wait wait because it gets

worse even content that did get flagged

in Myanmar often didn't get taken down

and one reason with that may be that

Facebook had shockingly few Burmese

speaking content reviewers how many you

know I'll just let this Reuters report

to tell you back in 2014 they had one

person they hired a second in early 2015

they out sourced an operation they'd

been doing that for a while but they had

had no Burmese speakers at all until

2015 when they hired

- it's true first they had one then they

doubled it to two and through

outsourcing added two more so full and I

don't know what the exact right number

of Burmese speakers for Facebook is but

it probably shouldn't be possible for

the sum total of them to be decimated in

a tandem bike accident and it's not like

Facebook can plead ignorance or surprise

about any of this multiple civil society

groups and individuals tried to warn

them as far back as 2013 five years ago

that they face trouble in Miami and

Facebook itself now admits that they

move too slowly though Zuckerberg

insists that they're now making progress

they've hired 60 burmese speakers me

recently told members of congress that

they're looking for more we're hiring

dozens of more Burmese language content

reviewers because hate speech is very

language specific it's hard to do it

without people who speak the local

language and we need to ramp up our

effort there dramatically hate speech is

language specific it's a little weird to

hear a guy who's been universally lauded

as a genius and a visionary say

something that's completely obvious as

if it's a brand new idea to him it's as

if Steve Jobs called everyone together

for his brand new discovery mrs.

Doubtfire was just the dad in a costume

yeah we know Steve

did you not get that I thought you were

smart I don't trust my iPhone now but

for all his reassuring words many argue

that Zuckerberg still hasn't done nearly

enough hate speech is still widespread

on Facebook in Miami last month four

months after Zuckerberg promised to do

better

Reuters found more than a thousand

Burmese language posts attacking the raw

ginger and other Muslims that were still

on Facebook and short you could say well

come on Reuters was actively looking for

those but you know who else could do

that maybe a company worth 500 billion

dollars

Reuters doesn't have 500 billion dollars

their journalist doesn't even seem to

have a decent webcam get the man a

decent webcam Reuters his work is

important

and despite its 60 hole Burmese speakers

Facebook is still struggling with the

language there in fact earlier this year

their community standards were so badly

missed translated into Burmese that

instead of saying we take our role in

keeping abuse of our service seriously

they said we take our role seriously by

abusing our services and small things

like that really matter

even punctuation can change the meaning

of a sentence for example and this is

true Bill Cosby once wrote a book that

I'm guessing was meant to be called come

on people but they admitted the comma so

it read come on people and you know deep

down perhaps that's when we should have

known and look look I am NOT saying that

the challenges Facebook is facing and

not significant but for a company that

moves fast and break things they have

sure moved slowly in trying to

fix them and until they do it is

painfully obvious that everyone should

be treating anything on their site with

extreme skepticism and see Facebook for

what it actually is a fetid swamp of

mistruths and outright lies interspersed

with the occasional reminder of a dead

pet that's it that's what it is so

instead of producing a Dilek ads about

connecting the world at the very very

least Facebook should be producing ads

that prepare countries for how to deal

with their product or suggest something

like this hi we're Facebook we're

connecting the world

and we're coming to your country whether

you like it or not so there's one thing

about Facebook you should probably know

somewhere between eighty and a hundred

percent of what's on our site is

complete my Facebook

page is full of lies about how happy I

am my Facebook page say I go to yoga

I've been like three times my Facebook

page says I'm a 19 year old girl all my

photos are of me with a baby but I don't

have baby fun we at Facebook believe in

giving everyone a voice without worrying

too much about what that voice then

chooses to say I mean how bad could it

be I don't believe the Holocaust

happened Oh yikes can someone please

explain to me why what Charlie Rose did

was so wrong I wouldn't post that but

you can George Soros invented mosquitoes

Hillary Clinton created aids yeah I'm

sure about that there is only one all

sent winner moving back and forth very

fast look it's not our place to tell you

you're wrong we're about making

connections can you connect me to my

brother

sure can you connect me to coca-cola oh

we can absolutely do that

but I can limit am an animal sake go

get'em at that I mean familiar I'm not

sure what you just said but it sounded

great

the point is Facebook is a platform

anyone can use to do good or bad it's

riddled with and quite honestly

we're never gonna be able to control or

contain it

so before you use our site for the first

time there's something you badly need to

remember Facebook is full of first

of all it's full of

we spoke with Joseph Jam to best boogie

no Maris por nada

first mommy cam said mommy Facebook are

the rust disgusting got a lily left of

this book in a park so they like karma

so in my team band say ah

a toilet Facebooker Lupo konjam

Facebook's a toilet and God willing your

country will survive it

we've really gotta fix that Facebook

we're toilet

[Laughter]

[Applause]



[Applause]

you

The border, the boundary
that is incredibly tough

to smuggle a monkey across...
I am told.

-(MONKEY SCREAMING)
-Shh.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

President Trump has famously
made securing the border

a key priority
for his administration,

most notably
through his border wall,

something which, as we've
pointed out before,

he himself inadvertently found
a flaw in on the campaign trail.

There's no ladder
 going over that.

If they ever get up there,
 they're in trouble.

'Cause there's no way
 to get down.

Maybe a rope.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Yeah. Yeah. Maybe a rope.

And I know that sounds stupid,
but to be fair,

you haven't heard Phase Six

of Donald Trump's
border security plan,

"Go get me all the ropes."

And while that wall idea
has received a lot of coverage,

it is by no means
Trump's only border plan.

One of his more benign-sounding,
but potentially

no less dangerous, ideas
concerns the Border Patrol.

And first, let's be clear
about who they are.

They are part of Customs
and Border Protection.

They are not ICE, who you may
know from immigration raids.

They're also
not customs officers,

who you'll see at airports
and border crossings,

nor are they the Borders Patrol,
a group of vigilantes

who defend abandoned Borders
bookstores from raccoons.

No, the Border Patrol
are the people in green uniforms

who literally patrol
the boundaries of our country.

There are around 20,000 of them.

But Trump,
in an executive order,

has called for them to add
five thousand more,

to tackle the many problems
that he sees

on our southern border.

Let's stop the drugs
 and the crime

from pouring into our country.

You can certainly
 have terrorists,

you can certainly
 have Islamic terrorists,

you can have anything
 coming across the border.

We're gonna have a strong,
 strong, strong border

that people are gonna respect,
 and the drugs are not gonna be

flowing across like gravy.

Now, that right there,
is what happens

when Donald Trump starts
a sentence feeling xenophobic

-and ends it feeling hungry.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

"We need to stop Mexicans
coming in like hot fudge sundaes

coming into my tummy,
three scoops, whipped cream,

no cherry,
'cause I don't do fruit."

But-- but for the record,
Border Patrol agents

do a lot more than just fight
drugs, crime and gravy.

In recent years, the number
of Mexicans apprehended
crossing the border

has dramatically dropped
and has now been surpassed

by the sharp rise in migrants
fleeing violence

in Central America, for whom
there is a legal process
to seek asylum here.

Meaning that agents' days

can frequently include
moments like this.

NEWSCASTER:
 The Boccé family take
 their first tentative steps

into the United States
 of America.

Within seconds,
 the Border Patrol are on them.

There's no chase, no tension.
 They expected to be caught.

(MAN SPEAKS IN SPANISH)

NEWSCASTER: As we film,
 another two figures emerge,

a mother and her daughter.

They're given blankets
 to protect them from the cold.

And that's kind of not
what people expect

when they think of the border.

In the Venn Diagram
of hardened drug dealers

and people who need blankets,

that middle section
is pretty much just Linus.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Oh, I'm sorry, he is not
a drug dealer?

The messy hair,
the stripy shirt,

the thumb-sucking...
He sells ecstasy at raves,

and he's high on his own supply
all the time.

There is no Great Pumpkin,

he's a junkie,
someone intervene!

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

But-- but the truth is,
it is moments like that there,

that show how difficult the job
of a Border Patrol agent can be,

because in that moment,
they are delivering aid

and processing migrants,
but later, that same day,

they may be chasing down
drug traffickers.

So, it's a mixture
between humanitarian work

and law enforcement,
and not everyone can do it.

And that is what makes
Trump's plan

to expand the Border Patrol
by 25 percent so concerning,

because if you hire agents
quickly and badly,

it can actually leave us
much less safe

and have
devastating consequences.

And the reason we know this
is because we have been
down this road before.

So, tonight, I would like
to talk to you

about the last Border Patrol
hiring surge,

because it wasn't that long ago.

NEWSCASTER: After the so-called
 bungling of intelligence
 leading up to 9/11,

President George W. Bush
is determined to shore things up
 at the borders.

As part of that mandate,
 the Border Patrol expanded

from 10,000 agents to 20,000.

It's true. The late 2000s saw
a surge in Border Patrol agents

that was matched only
by the surge in the number

of reality shows about people
making cakes.

There were so many of those,
you don't even know

which one of them I made up.

It was, by the way,
 Cake Cucks...

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-...which, I guarantee you,

will be in production
some time next week.

Now-- now, to meet the surge's
ambitious targets,

recruitment was aggressive,

and the government advertised
everywhere,

even, at one point,
doing this...

NEWSCASTER: The Border Patrol
 spent 8.4 million dollars
 sponsoring this car,

getting it detailed
and staffing recruitment booths.

(CAR REVVING)

That is honestly true.
They sponsored a NASCAR team,

putting the Border Patrol
in such fine company

as other actual NASCAR sponsors,
Depend Underwear,

-and Boudreaux's Butt Paste.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

A product for, I assume,
people who want their butt

-pasted closed.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And look, that wasn't all.

They also ran slickly-produced
TV ads, like this...

ANNOUNCER:
As a mobile law enforcement arm

of the Department
 of Homeland Security,

it is the job
 of the Border Patrol

to prevent terrorists
 and terrorist weapons,

and all those who seek
 to do us harm,

from entering the United States.

(RADIO CHATTER)

ANNOUNCER:
 The Border Patrol.

We protect America.
 Are you up to the challenge?

You have to admit, they make
that job look very exciting,

although, in fairness,
anything said

in that tone of voice
would be exciting.

(DEEP VOICE) Here is my kitten.
I named him Bootsie.

Don't wee on the rug, Bootsie.

I'm not sure he likes me
as much as I like him.

(RESUMES REGULAR TONE)
But the truth of their job is

that most agents work alone,
patrolling vast swathes
of desert.

And whilst some days feature
bursts of action,

others can involve
absolutely nothing,

which can be challenging
in and of itself.

REPORTER:
 One of the larger problems...
 is boredom.

HEYMAN: It doesn't mean
 that it's never dangerous.

There are bandits out there,
 there are drug organizations
 out there.

What they're not really getting
is preparation for...

the boring, non-risky reality
of almost all of their career.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Exactly.

Boredom is a significant part
of life

as a Border Patrol agent.

And they should probably train
for it.

For every hour they spend
in target practice,

they should probably spend
ten hours watching
 Mozart in the Jungle.

Are you funny?
Am I supposed to care about you?

Who's that woman with the oboe?

I'm confused,
but I'm also bored.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

But-- but the big problem was
that as they doubled in size,

meeting and maintaining
their hiring quotas meant

that their screening process
wasn't always as strong

as it could have been.

It was only late in the surge
that the CBP

started giving applicants
polygraph tests,

something that most other
federal law enforcement
agencies do,

and to listen to James Tomsheck,
who headed Internal Affairs

for CBP through most
of the surge,

their findings indicated
they probably should
have done that sooner.

TOMSHECK:
The shocking discovery we found

was that more than half
 of the persons

who had cleared
 background investigations,

failed the polygraph
 examination,

the vast majority of them
providing detailed descriptions

of the criminal activity
 they had been involved in.

Now, just think about that.
Over half of CBP's applicants,

who had cleared
the highest level
of background check,

were found unsuitable
for service.

And some of what
they confessed to

was absolutely incredible.

One applicant admitted
to smoking marijuana

twenty-thousand times
in a ten-year period.

Kudos to that individual.

While another stated he had
"no independent recollection

of the events that resulted
in a blood-doused kitchen,"

and was "uncertain if he had
committed any crime

during his three-hour blackout."

Which, I'm gonna go ahead
and say,

yes, you did commit a crime,
or at the very least,

you really fucked up a soufflé.

I mean, you fucked
that thing up bad.

And the problems didn't stop
once the new agents were hired,

because the training was also
significantly cut back,

and that caused real issues,
as one trainer revealed,

while, for some reason,

being disguised
as an asthmatic scarecrow.

REPORTER: We are disguising
 the face and voice

of this veteran agent
 and training instructor,

because of fears of retaliation.

AGENT:

So, the standards were lowered?

AGENT:

-What is happening there?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

He sounds like Jesse Ventura
after swallowing one of those

novelty cow-voice noise makers.

And look, I know that it is
really hard to pay attention

to what Robot Neil Young
is saying there,

but it is genuinely
worth listening

to where they cut corners.

REPORTER: The source told us
 Spanish-language classes

and physical training
 were cut back.

AGENT:

They cut back on Spanish
and physical training,

so the new standards affected
agents' ability

to talk to the people
they caught

and their ability
to catch the people
they wanted to talk to.

Which seem like pretty essential
facets of their job.

It's like if the training
program at SeaWorld left out

putting on a wetsuit
and systematically driving

carnivorous whales insane.

That's the whole job there!

Take them away, you're left
with nothing else!

And consequently,
as the ranks grew,

corruption and excessive force
sky-rocketed

and misconduct became
such a problem

that, at one point,
the Border Patrol felt it needed

to issue a memo about the fact
their agents

"were averaging two alcohol-
related arrests per week,"

and some agents off-duty
run-ins with the law

were even more spectacular.

BARBARA LEE-EDWARDS: Tonight,
 two Border Patrol agents

are on leave after a woman
 says they put on a lewd show

during Cirque du Soleil,
 performing a sex act

right in front of children.

The accusations
don't stop there.

The couple is suspected
of being drunk and violent.

(CHUCKLING) Wow!

Now, I should tell you,
one agent was found guilty

of assaulting the woman
who complained,

but both denied that anything
sexual was happening,

and they were found not guilty
of the sex act,

presumably because they were
at Cirque du Soleil,

where everything looks
like a sex act.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-I'll show you.

This... is a sex act.

This is a sex act.

This is a wildly difficult
sex act.

That is a bird person sex act.

And I have absolutely no idea
what's happening there,

but I think it's the thing
Steve Bannon is supposed
to be good at.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
AND CLAPPING)

And things got-- things got
more serious than that.

Since 2005, 77 agents
were arrested or indicted

for corruption, and if you think
about it,

Border Patrol agents
are particularly attractive

to drug-traffickers.

Remember, they often work
on their own,

patrolling the border,

which, as one journalist
points out,

is a pretty potent recipe
for trouble.

One Border Patrol agent
 can undo an incredible amount

of good that all the other
 Border Patrol agents do.

One Border Patrol agent
 can wave in tons of drugs.

And, you know--

Literally. Absolutely literally.

Yeah! This is one
of the only cases

where someone saying
"a ton of drugs"

actually means a literal ton
of drugs.

No, Kevin, you did not do
"a ton of drugs,"

you took a Benadryl,
you made out with a goldfish,

and you passed out with
your head in the dishwasher.

Pull your life together.

And look, let me give you
just a taste of the kind

of spectacular corruption
involved.

Take Agent Joel Luna,
who, it turned out,

had a brother in the Gulf Cartel
and who was convicted

of engaging in organized crime

with some
pretty striking evidence

emerging during a house search.

INVESTIGATOR:
 We end up finding a safe,
 a black safe.

We found 89,000 dollars
 in cash.

ROOT:
 Joel Luna's commemorative
 Border Patrol badge,

kilo and a half of cocaine,
 methamphetamine,

a gun that's tied directly
 to the Gulf Cartel,

it says "Gulf Cartel" on it.
It's hard to explain that away.

It's hard to explain
why your Border Patrol badge

is in a safe with cocaine,
money and a cartel pistol.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Yeah.

That is really hard to explain.

I mean, the best I can do
is, uh,

"My badge had a drug problem
that it couldn't bear

to tell me about, so finally,
it decided to shoot itself

with a gun that we found
on a case,

planning to die surrounded
by its money

because its views on death
resemble those
of Ancient Egyptians."

But even then, we are talking
about a sentient police badge

with an interest in Egyptology,
so you're already banking

on a pretty large suspension
of disbelief there.

Oh, and you should know,

Luna was hired during the last
recruitment surge.

And CBP will tell you
what they told us,

that while some agents did
disgrace the badge
with corruption,

the vast majority did not.

Although, it is worth knowing
that Tomsheck,

the Internal Affairs guy,

believes the problem
is much bigger than they imply.

Mr. Luna is not one bad apple.

He is part of
 a raid of corruption

that exceeded that of
 any other U.S. Federal
 law enforcement agency.

Okay, so it's less
"one bad apple,"

than, "Oh, my God.
That is a lot of bad apples."

Which, by the way, should really
be the marketing theme

for red delicious apples.

"Red delicious apples...

Well, at least we got
the 'red' part right!"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And it gets even worse.

Because remember,
these agents have guns.

And some have made
very bad decisions.

And you may have seen coverage
of some of the tragic incidents.

MAN: In a string of shootings
 by the Border Patrol

that have stirred up emotions
 at the border,

there's one case in particular

that has become
 a rallying cry for justice.

A shooting of a 16-year-old boy
 named

Joe Antonio Elena Rodriguez.

They say their agents
were threatened by somebody

throwing rocks on
this side of the fence.

But standing here,
the first thing you ask yourself

is, "Could a 16-year-old boy
really threaten somebody

standing on top of what's
at least a 20-foot cliff?

And on the other side
of that fence?"

I mean, yeah.
That does seem pretty unlikely.

And to explain why,
tune in next week

when our main story will be
"Gravity...

Arch-nemesis
to the concept of up."

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now, so you know,

that case is still
in the courts.

And agents can sometimes feel
threatened by rock throwers,

but it is worth pointing out
that a report which looked at
25 cases

where Border Patrol agents
shot people who'd thrown rocks,

concluded that "too many cases
do not appear to meet

the test
of objective reasonableness

with regard to the use
of deadly force."

Which I believe is kind of
law enforcement legalese for

"Holy shit! You shot some people
you should not have
fucking shot at.

-Maybe don't do that as much."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Oh, and there is one more thing
about the agent

in that fence shooting...
that will not surprise you.

He was one of those persons
hired by, uh, the Border Patrol

-during the surge.
-Of course he was.

And yet, despite all of these
warning signs,

we are about to embark
upon another ambitious

Border Patrol hiring surge.

And CBP will tell you
not to worry about that,

that in recent years
they've improved hiring
and made reforms.

For instance, they've slightly
increased transparency

and given agents more
non-lethal weapons

like pepper spray guns,

as well as rewriting
the use of force rulebook to,

and I quote, "prohibit
the shooting of suspects

fleeing the scene who do not
pose a threat to themselves
or others."

And look, that is great,

although it does seem
to be one of those rules

that you shouldn't have
had to write down.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-If you went to a zoo,

and there were a giant sign
that said,

"Please don't finger
the armadillos,"

you would wonder
what the fuck had happened

-before that sign went up.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CLAPPING)

But the problem is,
many other reforms
have not been made,

and it is hard to believe
that they will be

now that President
Gravy Drugs is in charge.

In fact, worryingly,
there has already been talk

that hiring standards
might drop again

with suggestions like
a shorter polygraph,

or removing parts of
the entrance exam.

And most frustratingly of all,
there may be no reason for us
to take this risk,

because a report from
the Inspector General
For Homeland Security

questions whether we even need
5,000 more Border Patrol agents.

And yet, Trump seems determined
to do this anyway.

Who knows why?

There is a fairly good chance
he only said 5,000

because someone told him
five bazillion is not
a real number.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

And look,
whatever your feelings...

about the laws the Border Patrol
have been given to enforce,

and I have plenty
of feelings on that,

you do want the best possible
people enforcing them,

because if you don't,
as we have seen,

bad things happen.

This is a story about the danger

of not learning from
your mistakes.

And for the sake of
absolutely everybody,

people on both sides
of the border,

and the good
Border Patrol agents

just trying to do
a difficult job well,

if we are going to hire
all these new people,

the very least we can do is be
more careful this time around.

And one tiny step would be
to have recruitment ads

that show potential agents
what the job is really like.

ANNOUNCER: The Border Patrol.

We protect America.

And we're hiring... again.

But this time,
 we're gonna do it right.

So if you're looking for
 an exciting,

heart-pounding adventure,

maybe go skydiving
 or try parkour,

or do whatever the fuck this is.

But the Border Patrol
 may not be for you.

Because a lot of the time
the job looks less like this...

And more like... this.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

ANNOUNCER: That's right.

Just you, the desert,
 and nothing for miles around.

(BIRD CAWS)

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

ANNOUNCER: This could be
 your lunch break.

This is a job that could combine
 hours of boredom

with sudden bursts of action.

AGENT: Oh, shit!

I got people moving.
I need backup!

(CAR ENGINE REVVING)

ANNOUNCER:
 And about that action...

it definitely can involve
 people entering illegally,

or drug smugglers.

But a surprising
 amount of the time,

it involves desperate migrants
 for whom you're the first
 point of contact

in a system ill-equipped
 to cater to their needs.

(AGENT MUMBLING)

These guys... here.

I don't...

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

Shit.

ANNOUNCER:
 This job is not for everyone.

And that's why this time,

we're not advertising
 with NASCAR.

Instead, we're recruiting with
 this sweet-ass Honda Odyssey.

A practical car for
 reasonable, methodical people.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)

ANNOUNCER: Please make sure
 you read the entirety

of this nuanced text
 before making any decisions.

And some of it's in Spanish,

because it would be
 really useful

if you could speak that.

But just to be clear, if you
wanna fuck at Cirque du Soleil,

this is not the job for you.

And we will find out.

Last question, have you ever...
and I mean ever

considered having
sexual relations

at a performance of
exotically dressed

Canadian acrobats?

No.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

We're done here.

ANNOUNCER: The point is,
if you're kind, physically fit,

impervious to bribery
 or boredom,

and you want to
 serve your country

by enforcing a controversial
 and ever-changing

set of policies in the most
 humane way possible,

then give us a call:
 The Border Patrol.

We're hiring!
 Wish us luck with that.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Circus-fuckers need not apply.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

China the country responsible for huge

technological advances and yet it still

can't seem to get pandas to china

is a gigantic and consequential country

where roughly one out of every five

people on earth live it is also the

place that trump has been ranting about

for years China is killing us what

China's doing to us is horrible China

cheats they devalue their currency we

can't continue to allow China to rape

our country and that's what they're

doing okay so even in the context of a

metaphor the word rape is pretty jarring

as verbs go it's not exactly bandied

about it's like if Trump said Congress

is really toe me on this border

wall the underlying point is clear what

he chose to express it that way is not

and yet for all that Trump talks about

China it seems that he's very much in

the process of learning about it just

watch what happened when microphones

picked up this exchange with China's

president during a state visit back in

November actually learned something

there rest assured the only thing you

took away from that conversation was

that Egypt is older and therefore less

though China okay great note to

self don't a gyp t' too old but the

truth Erie's a lot of us are probably

under informed about China and that's

something that its leaders have

historically been absolutely fine with

Deng Xiaoping famous we had a lay low

International Strategy summed up by the

same hide your strength and bide your

time but in recent years there has been

a significant shift regarding that

because when China's current leader Xi

Jingping

assumed the highest office in the land

he said this kumoi shock and awe that

China needs to learn more about the

world the world also needs to learn more

about China you know what he's right we

probably should talk more about China we

should probably have talked more about

it on this show especially considering

we've done roughly 4,000 different

stories on New Zealand and multiple

pieces on

testicle receptacle from the 2005

Russell Crowe film Cinderella man so so

tonight tonight let's talk about China

and let's put America aside for most of

this piece and talk instead about China

on its own terms because it's been going

through seismic social economic and

political changes which have happened

head-spinning Lee quickly and many of

them Center on its leader Xi Jinping who

just recently tightened his grip on

power

the most dramatic political change in

China in decades a vote to scrap term

limits for China's president the move

clears the way for Xi Jinping to stay in

power indefinitely and possibly for life

of nearly three thousand ballots only

two voted against the unprecedented move

three thousand to two which means after

that vote there were two members of

Chinese Parliament thinking whoopsy you

really thought that would go the other

way maybe an edible arrangement will

smooth things over with the man who's

now emperor for life and that followed

on the heels of what was arguably an

even bigger change the fact that last

October

she's political doctrine known as Xi

Jinping thought was enshrined in the

party's constitution and that may not

sound like much to you but it's roughly

the equivalent of Donald Trump making

himself a founding father and including

Donald Trump thought into the

Constitution which would mean that

historians in the future would have to

pass the meaning of while Bette Midler

is an extremely unattractive woman I

refuse to say that because I always

insist on being politically correct

and she's consolidation of power has

been aided by the fact that unlike many

of his predecessors who tended to be

dull bureaucrats he's gone out of his

way to form a cult of personality about

himself for a time state media called

him she Dada or uncle she both of which

are objectively weird names for an adult

to call another another adult but

fantastic names for a pair of hairless

cats see Dada uncle she dinner's ready

creepy weirdos

and she carefully presents eight

man-of-the-people image his origin story

is famous in China are born into an

elite family his father fell from grace

and like many during Mao's Cultural

Revolution she was sent to work in a

rural village a place which has now

become a tourist trap the smartly

dressed tour guide shows us where she

slept an old picture on the wall we see

a well he helped dig and a sewing shop

he set up old farmers who knew she back

then still roam about these pseudo

mascots of this Bazaar theme park yeah

that is a bazaar theme park and I'll say

that knowing full well that this

country's most beloved theme park

features vomit-inducing teacups and a

massive pantsless sailor duck with no

genitals and she's branding isn't

confined to tourist attractions state

media has also featured folksy moments

like this video of him ordering pork

buns at a Beijing restaurant now that

visit was huge news in China and that

could be hard to believe because our

politicians eat junk food in front of us

all the time you can find photos of 12

of the last 12 presidents shoving ice

cream into their faces it's actually

legitimately challenging to find a

single photo of Obama where he is not

about to inhale half a pint of vanilla I

didn't even remember that he'd been

demolishing a waffle cone during the bin

Laden raise but clearly I'd remembered

it wrong I was wrong but but the reasons

for Xi's popularity go beyond marketing

himself as a cuddly XI data that you can

grab a pork bun with because for

starters he is riding an economic wave

that long precedes him over the last 30

years China's GDP growth has averaged

nearly 10 percent a year making it the

fastest sustained expansion by a major

economy in history which has enabled

more than 800 million people to lift

themselves out of poverty and many in

China's growing middle class are pretty

content with how things have been going

the tremendous public optimism is

striking everyone is doing better than

their parents did in their day I think

we'll be able to move to a bigger house

within the next 5 years and I expect my

life to improve a lot whatever happens

I'm very optimistic about the future Wow

a sense of optimism about the future

I've got a say as a British person I

just find that utterly incomprehensible

if you look up optimism in the OED and

this is true the definition simply reads

no so for many in China

things are going undeniably well but she

has even greater ambitions and I'd like

to focus on two massive signature

projects one global and one domestic

first there's his so-called belt and

road initiative a plan which is

absolutely gigantic in scope basically

involves China spending a trillion

dollars on infrastructure projects in

more than 60 countries things like ports

bridges and roads with the idea that it

could eventually span international land

and sea routes and reshape global trade

with China at its center to hear China

tell it it is the most ambitious

infrastructure project in modern history

they've even produced an

english-language propaganda video to

tell the whole world about it

[Music]

okay if I could just if I could just

interrupt this irritating Old Navy

commercial Hawking a trillion dollar

infrastructure plan I know I know that

you're probably thinking right now if I

have to listen to one more second of

that it's going to be stuck in my head

all week well just be thankful that you

haven't heard the rap break until now I

can't take it anymore

either they basically made communist

kars4kids that is too early to say

whether the belt and road is going to be

a success but she's second bold project

has already seen results because he's

undertaken a massive crackdown on

political corruption a long-standing

grievance among Chinese citizens it's

led to the investigation and punishment

of hundreds of thousands of government

officials some at the very top of the

party and this has been widely

celebrated with the state media even

producing a crackdown themed computer

game the People's Daily a Communist

Party mouthpiece released a computer

game where users can give electric

shocks to corrupt officials what could

possibly be sinister about being invited

to electrocute prisoners in a

government-issued game that is the most

entertaining way to package something

disturbing since FDR smash-hit board

game Candyland just kidding it's a

japanese-american internment camp and

this this is where we reach the point of

the story that you're kind of knew was

coming because so far everything that

I've shown you is what she data wants

you to know about China but there is a

lot of troubling stuff under the surface

for instance conveniently for she some

of those swept up in the corruption

purge were his political rivals and

those accused were often funneled into a

system that's been described as a

secretive extra legal process where

interrogators seek to extract

confessions sometimes through torture

and it's worth knowing that those term

limits that he successfully eliminated

were put in place for a pretty good

reason specifically to avoid another

maou under whose regime some horrific

things happened in China from a

collectivized farming attempt that was

responsible for at least 45 million

deaths - a Cultural Revolution that was

estimated to have killed at least

another million - his belief that this

swimsuit was flattering which I realize

now that I say out loud really doesn't

belong with the other two in that list

the point the point here is she is

actively removing the post male

guardrails that were put in place and

while China has never exactly been known

as a haven for free expression

he has clamped down noticeably on any

form of dissent whatsoever there is

dissent online and China's censors are

working hard to quash it they

temporarily ban the use of phrases such

as personality cult and my Emperor and

also references to Winnie the Pooh a

character long used to mock Xi Jinping

based on an apparent resemblance

apparently Xi Jinping is very sensitive

about his perceived resemblance to

Winnie the Pope and I'm not even sure

it's that strong a resemblance to be

honest but the fact he's annoyed about

it means people will never stop bringing

it up trust me she if your face even

remotely resembles that of a beloved

cartoon character the smart move here is

to lean in and backing down on Winnie

the Pooh comparisons

doesn't exactly project strength it

suggests a weird insecurity in him and

experts say that she is deeply concerned

the public opinion will turn on him

China's economy is already slowing and

she's reportedly haunted by the specters

of the Arab Spring and the Soviet

Union's collapse and that paranoia

may be why he's so anxious to

micromanage Chinese daily life the

government has a list of untrustworthy

people which can restrict citizens

ability to travel buy a house or take

out loans and over the next few years

there are plans to take things much

farther every Chinese citizen is being

assigned a social credit score a

fluctuating rating based on a range of

behaviors it's believed their community

service

buying Chinese made products can raise

your score fraud tax evasion and smoking

and non-smoking areas can drop it

if a score gets too low a person can be

banned from buying plane and train

tickets real estate cars and even

high-speed Internet yeah you could be

cut off from a high-speed Internet

although that could actually be a huge

opportunity for the finest purveyors of

shitty low-speed Internet

I'm talking of course about AT&T as of

this week our parent company so goodbye

everyone it's been fun it gets much much

darker here in fact she's crackdown on

human rights he's apparently the most

intense since Tiananmen Square and that

is not good because Tiananmen Square is

on the short list of places so infamous

you don't even need to describe what

happened like Chernobyl or Jonestown or

that one Cheesecake Factory we can't go

to anymore and she has intensified

government suppression of certain

religions in one province

Christians have been told to take down

the image of Jesus and Hank portraits of

she instead something I've also done by

the way so yeah I think it really ties

the room together it's a nice accent

piece and a Muslim population known as

we guys have been singled out for

dystopian levels of surveillance and

persecution here is one man talking

about a form that the government had him

fill out this piece of paper was sent to

everyone people had to fill it out

they asked things like if you are weaker

if you have a job if you have a passport

if you pray all these answers were

turned into a scoring system they would

categorize people into safe regular and

unsafe people that's pretty chilling cuz

generally speaking whenever people are

placed on lists it's not really turned

out well for anyone involved many of

history's greatest monsters put people

on lists Nixon the Nazis Santa all of

these animals did that I looked sure

enough if you are deemed unsafe for

whatever reason you're in big trouble

because China has incarcerated Muslims

in reeducation camps with as many as

800,000 individuals in facilities which

reportedly

to rewire the political thinking of

detainees arrays their Islamic beliefs

and reshape their very identities making

uncle Shi less like your fun uncle and

more like your creepy uncle who

imprisons 800,000 people in his

basements and if you want to see what it

looks like when she's jumping thought

gets put into Xi Jingping practice just

just take the story of Nobel Peace Prize

winner huge elbow he was imprisoned in

2009 for writing a pro-democracy

manifesto and last summer he died in

state custody and even China seemed

concerned about how that might look

fearing domestic backlash government

censors went to work social media post

mentioning Liu's name were deleted

online searches with his name were

blocked even simple candle emojis were

deemed illegal on some sites CNN signal

in China has been cut by government

censors every time we mention his name

exactly the Chinese media wouldn't allow

mentions of a Nobel Peace Prize winners

name which is a pretty intense level of

censorship but it's also my personal

policy towards Guatemalan activists

Rigoberta menchú do not bring her up

around me she knows what she did you

know what you did Rigoberta you know

what you did I don't hear our name on

your lips that's not what this meetings

about

but the point is what it is what

happened to you she'll bo and his wife

who is still under house arrest is

absolutely tragic although to his credit

he didn't go down without taking a final

swing one of the last known photos of

Lee you was with his wife Lucia at first

glance unremarkable but notice the mugs

they're holding yep

that's really the true

good for that chuckling I think deep

down we all know when you need to really

tell someone to go themselves

why not do it with a mark what the hope

the whole point here is under Xi

Jingping China is becoming more

authoritarian just as it has major plans

for expansion onto the world stage so

the era of hide and bide is over and the

era of do as we say may be dawning

because China has significant economic

leverage and it has been using that to

silence criticism even when criticism is

very much warranted the European Union

hardly squeaks about human rights

anymore or certainly the British don't

you don't get much on Tibet either

because whenever anyone raises any of

these issues China turns around and says

do you want to do business or not of

course because China knows no matter how

badly they behave the world will still

want to do business with them they're

like Facebook oh I'm sorry you don't

like us mining your data and

undercutting your democracy what exactly

are you gonna do about it

male people printed out photos of your

meals you ate call your friends and tell

them happy birthday and out loud words I

don't think so go yourself

here is where having set America aside

at the start we should bring it back in

because it is arguably more important

than ever than America be strategic and

tactical about how to deal with China

sadly those qualities are not hallmarks

of this guy who couldn't play chess for

longer than 29 seconds without screaming

my horse eats your big lady and pouring

nacho cheese all over the board

Trump is blowing up the traditional

alliances that have helped influence

Chinese behavior on important issues and

that has been great news for Xi Jinping

as has the fact that human rights don't

really seem to be a big trump priority

in fact just hours after the death of

you gel polo

even has it as his administration issued

condolences Trump himself said this

president she is a terrific guy I like

being with him a lot and he's a very

special person Wow

that was not the best time to give Xi

Jinping a pat on the back it's the

equivalent of saying how much you love

Kevin Spacey in American Beauty right

now first you shouldn't it was

objectively terrible and second you're

picking the worst possible time to bring

that up

the point is Trump is leaving a vacuum

on the world stage and China is more

than happy to fill it by telling the

world its story and leaving out some

very important details so for everyone's

benefit if they're going to send out

cuddly propaganda videos about Xi

Jinping at his achievements someone

might want to make a companion piece the

kind of rounds out the picture

[Music]

[Applause]

taina bandung now it's growing big enjoy

let's learn about it now in this

annoying hum they have a president so

call him uncle she bunny can with

you instead

[Music]

he'll add a shield for you

[Music]

you

[Applause]

I would like to talk about doctors there

among our most trusted professionals

nearly 70% of us write them highly on

ethical standards our lives and

occasionally our balls are in their

hands which is why it was especially

troubling last week to see this with his

syndicated TV show magazine and website

dr. oz has become one of America's most

trusted Doc's but on Capitol Hill

Tuesday he was on the hot seat excuse me

but any seat dr. oz is sitting on is the

hot seat so what did the doctor do they

criticized the talk-show hosts for

describing untested weight loss

supplements as magical or miraculous I

want you write it down Garcinia cambogia

because it may be the simple solution

you've been looking for to bust your

body fat for good now I've got the

number-one miracle and a bottle to burn

your fat lightning in a bottle

it's a miracle flower to fight fat

miracle flowers are you a doctor or an

Old West traveling salesman and I got

something miraculous for you ladies and

gentlemen and monkeys pour mixed with

five petals of a rose and a thimble full

of otter semen guaranteed to cure your

lumbago step right up step right over

here the Senate hearing was about the

marketing of dietary supplements and

unfortunately no one is more effective

at that than dr. oz Oz's advice is so

influential that one mention of a

product can cause sales to skyrocket the

phenomenon even has its own name dr. oz

effect after dr. oz touted a substance

called green coffee bean extract one

company in Florida sold half a million

bottles well what what's so wrong with

that name me one case where a man named

oz claimed mystical powers and led

people horribly as

namely one case you can't do it the only

problem with the dr.oz effect is that

magic pills don't technically exist and

dr. oz knows that do you believe that

there's a miracle pill out there there's

not a pill that's gonna help you

long-term lose weight and live your best

life without diet and exercise do you

believe there's a magic weight-loss cure

out there it the word Metin if you're

selling something because it's magical

no that would be ridiculous no one is

claiming there's a magic pill out there

that would be stupid

this little bean has scientists saying

date time and magic weight-loss cure for

every body type see he never said there

was a magic pill he said there was a

magic bean that's clearly entirely

different because magic beans are a very

real thing that you tried to cow for so

you can steal a golden heart from a

giant that's science and by the way a

recent study found the main ingredient

in those magic beans not only fails to

help lab mice it gave them the early

symptoms of diabetes though if you're a

lab mouse with diabetes you got off easy

good luck getting any sympathy in the

lab mouse support group oh I'm sorry you

can't have any candy I've got an ear

growing out of my back Jeff's

got herpes sorry Jeff his his mission

dr. oz is a doctor and one word degrees

from two Ivy League schools

he's also dangerously likeable watch how

morning joe reacted after seeing bits of

his congressional testimony i live up in

once it didn't can I just say for us I

like duck

I will confirm or deny like I'm a lot

like diners coming here with really good

advice rated by nod and listen if he's

got magic coffee beans I want some of it

you just showed a report that implied

they didn't work he basically just in an

emperor's new clothes piece and they

ended it by saying by the way the

Emperor's tailor was incredible that guy

can stitch and to give dr. Ross the

benefit of overwhelming medical doubt he

seems to be standing by some of his

claims I actually do personally believe

in the items that I talk about in the

show I passionately study them I

recognize that oftentimes they don't

have the scientific muster to present as

fat but that's the whole point you're

presenting it as a doctor if you want to

keep spouting this that's fine

but don't call it your show dr. oz call

it check this out with son God

knows Mehmet just

title to be fair the problem is this

Senate hearing is going to achieve

nothing for a very chilling reason

beyond embarrassing dr. oz there's very

little that Congress can do in this

arena it is the Federal Trade

Commission's job to go after online

scams and even they Yale can only

scratch the surface she's right dr. oz

is just a symptom of the problem the

disease is the fact that dietary

supplements in the US are shockingly

unregulated there are two agencies who

theoretically oversee things the FTC and

the FDA the FTC is supposed to regulate

the marketing of supplements but by

their own admission they give great

deference to the FDA on whether a

company's health claim can be supported

the problem with that is the FDA has

little authority to investigate the

contents of supplements until people are

already getting sick from them that

sounds crazy and in the past they

actually tried to change this in the

late 1980s 38 people died from

l-tryptophan supplements and in response

the FDA tried to expand its authority

how did that go

in 1993 the industry struck back

consumers were urged to write to their

congressman or told they may have to

kiss their vitamin C goodbye so did

people write to their congressman more

people wrote to Congress about the

supplement bill then wrote about the

Vietnam War

what how good must the pro-vitamin

protest songs have been ginseng huh what

is it good for sexual dysfunction of

type two diabetes

so you Daniel actually there were

actually no protests on but there were

PSAs put out by the supplement industry

featuring not just jackbooted thugs

coming to take your vitamins but a

surprise celebrity cameo breathe hey

guys it's only vitamins if you don't

want to lose your vitamins make the FDA

stop call the US Senate and tell them

that you want to take your vitamins in

peace if enough of us do that it'll work

Oh 1993 it was a different time

when you could plausibly say hey be

quiet everybody

let's all listen to what Mel Gibson has

to show and the supplement industry

didn't just pay for ads they gave money

to lawmakers like Republican senator

Orrin Hatch and Democratic Senator Tom

Harkin this was then back then they

actually became the two top recipients

of funds from the industry and in a

crazy coincidence they co-sponsored a

bill to deregulate it I send to the desk

a substitute amendment on behalf of

senators hatch and Harkin today we

honored the wishes of 100 million people

consumers of dietary supplements people

who simply want the ability to lead

healthy lifestyles without the constant

intervention of one tiny agency which is

possessed by a regulatory zeal equaling

none regulatory zeal he just criticized

a regulatory agency for being too into

regulating things that's like accusing

your podiatrist of having a foot fetish

dude dude dude you you're obsessed with

feet it just tone it down a bit now the

supplement industry will claim that it

is one of the more highly regulated

industries see how true you think that

is because if you're a supplement

company today you do not need approval

from the FDA before a product is

marketed you can make health claims

without prior approved

all from the government and you don't

have to prove the safety or

effectiveness of your products before

putting it up for sale the industry is

essentially supposed to police itself

that's not one of those porn sites that

asks you to enter your own age which

basically just ends up teaching children

how to subtract 18 from the current year

it doesn't work which may explain why

since 1994 the supplement industry has

gone from making four billion dollars to

thirty two billion dollars a year with

almost no side effects people who

consume tainted dietary supplements have

suffered from negative side effects like

severe bleeding strokes liver damage or

even death health officials say the

common item linked to several recent

cases of acute liver failure in Hawaii

is oxyelite pro Orioles pitcher Steve

bechler who died after taking a federer

during last spring training ephedra

stayed on the market an extra two years

after many experts asked for a ban

meantime the number of deaths rose to

155 with 16,000 adverse events wow

that's enough to make you wish for an

agency with a certain amount of them

what's the phrase regulatory zeal and

yet lawmakers still resist regulation

because when two years ago a bill was

proposed suggesting supplements should

carry warning labels about potentially

dangerous side effects you'll never

guess who popped up again the FDA

already has a tremendous amount of

regulatory oversight and enforcement

tools when it comes to dietary

supplements every supplement has a label

has the ingredients and the potency by

law on every single item that is sold as

a supplement that's right Hatchin harken

who in 2012 had retained their title of

the top two recipients of campaign funds

from the supplement industry see two

decades later those campaign

contributions still working

who says nutritional supplements don't

have long-lasting effects

and by the way on the point that Senator

Harkin made about how every supplement

has a label saying what's inside it well

funny story when a group of researchers

recently DNA tested supplements from a

dozen North American companies they

found that one-third contained no trace

whatsoever of the plant advertised on

the bottle if one in three milk bottles

didn't contain milk you might think

twice about pouring the white mystery

liquid all over your cereal but none of

this is likely to change because

companies have access to the one

genuinely truly effective wonder drug

it's called lobbying and here's how the

science works FDA regulation can really

stop up your profits jamming up your

whole money-making system which can lead

to painful effects on the company's

bottom line but with lobbying somehow

legal process all those pesky

regulations just melt away into

nothingness giving you that comfortable

corporate feeling of money

almost uncontrollably ask your lawyers

if lobbying is right for you

none of that stock none of this answers

the key dr. oz question now he says he

wasn't paid to mention any particular

products so why say those things on TV

at all in intent to engage viewers I use

flowery language I used language that

was very passionate that makes sense

because we're all looking for flowery

language from our physicians like the

sunlight shines upon the hidden grassy

meadow

so does chlamydia cast a warm glow upon

your private parts and when he says

engaging viewers that is the problem

perhaps his fatal flaw is that he's done

870 daily hour-long shows about health

and medicine which is impossible sooner

or later you're going to get tired of

doing shows about what your poop should

look like with Cameron Diaz this is ever

happen to you and luckily no I'm not a

girl that gets constipated good good for

you lucky you Diaz lucky you and instead

of that you're gonna get tempted to

overstretch and do a show with a title

like can an aspirin a day keep cancer

away to which the answer is clearly no

not not entirely because I feel like if

it did we wouldn't be hearing about it

for the first time at 4:00 p.m. on a

Wednesday afternoon hey did you hear

that I cured cancer no I was watching

Wendy Williams and look the frustrating

thing is it's easy to fill a show with

shameless pandering without dangerously

misleading medical information here I'll

show you I'll show you pandering that

you wouldn't believe hey everyone

wouldn't it be great if we had a Skype

interview with george RR martin the

writer of Game of Thrones

let's do it hey George George ha how's

the writing going I just killed

threatened your favorite character what

it's not aria it's not aria is it George

is not Aria please tell me it's not aria

just give me a clue damn you Martin okay

what what people seem to like that and

no one got hurt so let's keep pandering

um everyone likes puppies don't they

he's a puppy right now here's a puppy

hello puppy in know puppy look look

neither I nor a puppy are making

unsubstantiated claims about potentially

harmful dietary supplements you're not

doing that are you puppy look because

you don't need to do you precious you

don't need to unlock look here's a

here's something else that people like

women in trashy dresses throwing wine in

each other's faces

um go ladies calm down it's all

fabricated

let's keep pandering um who wants a

t-shirt

who wants a

people love t-shirts they know t-shirts

almost as much as they love celebrities

dancing and guess what his Steve Buscemi

tap dancing

we even know

any thoughts the only questionable

benefits of dietary supplements Oh John

this isn't really the time or place for

that discussion

exactly that's the point see dr. Moss

we've done it we engage viewers without

recommending any unregulated products we

can reduce diabetes please welcome the

black and gold Marty elite

you

journalists the heroes that we root for

in movies like all the President's Men

the great Muppet Caper and most recently

spotlight we gotta nail these scumbags

we gotta show people that nobody could

get away with this

not a priest or a cardinal a freakin

Pope

I remember spotlight actually won Best

Picture at the Oscars this year meaning

newspapers finally received the

recognition that we normally reserved

the subject of such importance as the

incredible bravery of real-life

Hollywood filmmakers the incredible

bravery of fictional Hollywood

filmmakers and the incredible bravery of

wanting to your daughter's friends

but but one of one of the things that

made spotlights so powerful is the

knowledge that the newspaper industry

today is in big trouble

papers have been closing and downsizing

for years and that affects all of us

even if you only get your news from

Facebook Google Twitter or Arianna

Huffington's blockwork Junction and book

excerpt Clearinghouse those places are

often just repackaging the work of

newspapers and it is not just websites

watch how often TV news ends up citing

print sources according to the Chicago

Tribune according to the Detroit Free

Press according to the San Francisco

Chronicle according to The Times

Picayune the Boston Globe the Orlando

Sentinel the Philadelphia Inquirer the

Pittsburgh tribune-review the Detroit

News and the Houston Chronicle reports

the Los Angeles Times reports The

Oklahoman reports The Hartford Courant

reports the Salt Lake Tribune reports

it's pretty obvious without newspapers

around to cite TV news would just be

Wolf Blitzer endlessly batting a ball of

yarn around and it is not just news

outlets stupid shows like ours lean

heavily on local papers in fact whenever

this show is mistakenly called

journalism it is a slap in the face to

the actual journalists whose work we

rely on I'll give you just one example

two years ago we ran a piece on state

lotteries and a not insignificant

portion of it was built on the work of

Harry Astaire a reporter at The

Oregonian here is a clip we used of him

talking about this series on camera Here

I am quoting one of his Oregonian

stories directly and Here I am doing it

again you probably didn't notice it at

the time because you were too fixated on

my balls choice of shiny gray tie we

check a dress shirt the ty says mafia

funeral the shirt says high school

debate tournament and the face says I am

not confident enough to carry this lock

off but but the point is we used a lot

of hairy steps work in that piece and

and we try to add new information to our

stories our researchers work incredibly

hard but the media is a food chain which

would fall apart without local

newspapers and the problem is print ads

are less popular than with advertisers

than they used to be and online ads

produce much less revenue I'll show you

between 2004 and 2014

newspapers gained two billion dollars in

online ad revenue unfortunately in that

same period they lost thirty billion

dollars in print revenue so that's like

finding a Lucky Penny on the sidewalk on

the same day your bank account is

drained by a 16 year old Belgian hacker

and this has led to cutbacks in

newsrooms again look at the Oregonian it

used to be a big moneymaker in fact in

1993 their editor talked about how proud

he was of its record of success I've

been at that paper more than 40 years

and every year I've been there I've seen

our staff increase I've seen our

salaries increase not a years gone by

that an employee at the Reunion

full-time employee has not been a

beneficiary of a raise now that level of

confidence is almost tempting fate

he's like a citizen of Pompeii saying

what I love about this city is how

volcano-proof it is not a year goes by

without us not having to have our

horrified reactions captured in Ash

forever

unfortunately the Oregonian circulation

has since dropped and in 2013 just as

hairiest EV was working on his lottery

series their parent company advanced

publications dropped a bombshell this

picture tweeted out from inside the

Oregonian shows staffers listening as

editor Peter Bhatia broke the news some

had feared the paper will split in two

stop seven-day-a-week Home Delivery and

lay off some employees this is an a

strategic move to really focus everybody

on what that digital

future is and what our digital products

and services can be it's true they

became a digital first company and

digital first sounds like a high school

euphemism for seductively sucking on a

finger I put my finger in his mouth we

totally got to digital first it was like

ooh but it was also like hot and that

that meant big changes a local weekly

the willamette week got their hands on a

PowerPoint presentation for the

Oregonian staff outlining the fact

reporters would be expected to meet a

quota of three blog posts a day and on

any post of substance they would have to

post the first comment and what better

way to win the trust of your readers

than posting first underneath your own

article those rules were widely

criticized and have since been relaxed

but extra digital demands being placed

on journalists is now common throughout

the industry just listen to Washington

Post editor Marty Baron who you might

remember as the guy Liev Schreiber

played in spotlight he describes his

concerns about the average workload

required of journalists they have to do

their traditional reporting they have

participate in social media they have to

produce a wire service that's available

24 hours a day they have to be

responsible for video you name it

they're involved they're involved in it

it's a lot to ask that's true and if

journalists are constantly required to

write edit shoot videos and tweet

mistakes are going to get made perhaps

that is how the Boston Globe wound up

tweeting following a shooting in

Tennessee that the FBI had invested

farted about 70 leaks clearly if they

had more time they would have written

hashtag investor farted because that's

how you drive the conversation hashtag

investor party

now now add the Oregonian and the

Oregonian those digital demands came

just as almost a quarter of the newsroom

was laid off and over time even more

staffers left the paper including State

House reporters a two-time Pulitzer

winner and Harry is Steph so his work

bolstered our lottery piece and now the

lack of his work has bolstered this

journalism piece so you can't say that

we don't use every part of the hairiest

EV but here is where it gets frightening

because while the Oregonian rebuilt its

Statehouse team other papers have been

forced to simply go without a study of

over 200 papers found between 2003 and

2014 their number of full-time State

House reporters declined by 35 percent

and that's not good because while there

are some great web outlets

some of which do cover local government

there aren't nearly enough to replace

what has been lost just listen to David

Simon who before creating the TV show

the wire worked for years at the

Baltimore Sun the day I run into a

Huffington Post reporter at a Baltimore

Zoning Board hearing is the day that I

will be confident that we've actually

reached some sort of equilibrium you

know there there's no glory in that kind

of journalism but that is the bedrock of

what keeps you know got the next 10 or

15 years in this country are going to be

a halcyon error for state and local

political corruption is gonna be one of

the great times to be a corrupt

politician well you know I I really envy

them I really do he's right because not

having reporters at government meetings

is like a teacher leaving her room of

seventh graders to supervise themselves

best-case scenario Brittany gets gum in

her hair worst case scenario you no

longer have a school

I look it is clearly smart for

newspapers to expand online but the

danger in doing that is the temptation

to gravitate toward whatever gets the

most clicks

which is why news organizations badly

need to have leaders who appreciate that

what's popular isn't always what's most

important but that is not always the

case look at Sam Zell a billionaire

investor and living garden gnome nine

nine years ago he took over the Tribune

Company which owns newspapers like the

LA Times the Orlando Sentinel and the

Chicago Tribune after acquiring the

company he spoke to the Sentinels

nervous staff outlining his vision and

listened to one particular exchange with

a journalist his his last two words are

perhaps the most illuminating 11 very

simple I want to make enough money so I

can afford you it's really that simple

okay you need to in effect help me by

being a journalist that focuses and what

our readers want and therefore generates

more revenue but what readers want a

puppy dogs II mean we also need to

inform the community sorry I'm sorry ah

I can't hug him you're you're giving me

the classic what I would call

journalistic arrogance of deciding that

puppies don't come hopefully they get to

the point where our revenue is so

significant that we can do puppies

interact okay

whoa Sam Zell just created an inspiring

new motto for the Sentinels masthead all

the puppy news that's fit to print and

maybe some Iraq news too if we can

afford it

q now now the good news is Zell no

longer owns the tribune company the bad

news is their latest attempt to balance

business pressures with journalistic

responsibility has not been

confidence-inspiring just this year its

publishing arm tribute publishing was

rebranded into something much much

stupider this is the future of

journalists this is the future of

content it doesn't get much better than

that if you care about media and

technology this is the place to be

Truong stands for attribute online

content yes trunk they have chosen to

call themselves trunk which sounds like

the noise and ejaculating elephant mates

or or more appropriately the sound of a

stack of print newspapers being thrown

into a dumpster and if you are wondering

how trunks business model will be

different get ready to have your minds

trunked one of the key ways we're going

to harness the power of our journalism

is to have a optimization group this

trunk team will work with all the local

markets to harness the power of our

local journalism feed it into a funnel

and then optimize it so that we reach

the biggest global audience possible

what did she just say they're going to

feed journalism into a funnel oh we're

just going to take content and simply

cram it down your throat like you're an

abused goose and the corresponding

visuals make even less sense what is

happening here it looks like a bunch of

digital sperm impregnating a trunk egg

filming but what seems at first like a

banal corporate rebranding speech

quickly goes off the rails with their

next big idea artificial intelligence is

going to allow journalists to do their

jobs more efficiently

finding the right photos the videos the

databases the things that you were

packaged your stories with right now

that's a manual effort with artificial

intelligence you can create a system

that automatically is doing that for you

ok ok ok putting aside the news robots I

would like to take a moment to break

down what may be the most meaningless

graphic ever created we take a look on

the left there is the phrase

reading habits but once those reading

habits undergo X they become increased

consumption

it almost feels like a test and the

first employee to raise their hand and

say that doesn't mean anything becomes

king of the news and look it is easy to

make fun of tronc I could happily do it

for another 20 minutes but the truth is

publishers are desperate no one seems to

have a perfect plan to keep newspapers

afloat

one option seems to be to pray you get

bought by a billionaire benefactor who

could afford to swallow losses Amazon

founder Jeff Bezos bought The Washington

Post in 2013 and since then they've done

some spectacular journalism and the

reporters seem pretty happy despite some

of his stupider ideas like and this is

true a game that would allow a reader

who didn't enjoy an article to pay to

remove its vowels which is just absurd

taking out all the vowels makes every

word sound like the name of an app I'll

give you an example Turkey is a nation

in crisis Turk is a dating service that

helps you long-haul truckers but but

there are potential downsides to having

a rich owner especially if there is a

concern that they could meddle with the

papers coverage just look at what

happened to the Las Vegas review-journal

last year it was acquired by Sheldon

Adelson at the billionaire casino

magnate and Republican mega donor he's a

big deal in Vegas and his businesses are

at the center of a lot of stories the

reviewed journal covers but while

Adelson and the papers editors have

strongly denied that he interferes with

news coverage in any way the editors

have admitted that they put any articles

about him or his business through a

special review process to make sure that

they are fair although listen to an ex

deputy deputy editor describe his

experience of that process in this

review process things are changed things

are added things are removed there's no

explanation for why and there's no

appeal more than once reporters have

asked if they could have their name

taken off the story and have been told

no that's not allowed anymore there are

things that are done because it's known

that this is the way Sheldon Adelson

wants it to read and it can be something

very minor or it can be something very

very big

now if that's true that is very

compromising there could not be a worse

owner of a paper in Vegas than Sheldon

Adelson with the possible exception of

cirque de soleil because they wouldn't

even give you a newspaper you just have

a fistful of glitter

thrown in your face by a 90-pound man in

a thong and and look look none of this

is to say that there aren't people

producing great work in local news rooms

right now many are at the Oregonian at

the review-journal

even at trunk but they are doing

it despite their current conditions and

the truth is a big part of the blame for

this industry's dire straits is on us

and our unwillingness to pay for the

work journalists produce we've just

grown accustomed to getting unused for

free and the longer that we get

something for free the less willing we

are to pay for it and I'm talking to you

the person watching this segment on

YouTube using the Wi-Fi from the coffee

shop underneath your apartments killing

us

so later we are either going to have to

pay for journalism or we are all going

to pay for it because if we don't

not only will malfeasance run amok but

the journalism movies of the future are

going to look a lot more like this in a

city built on secrets I'm hearing

there's corruption in City Hall

only a newsroom willing to stop at

nothing can uncover the truth and might

go all the way to the top all the way to

the top a new and I think we could prove

that they knew

yeah I'm just not sure what can I clicks

we're gonna get on that you know anybody

else I've got a thing about a cat that

looks like a raccoon or it could be a

raccoon it looks like a cat wait I'm not

sure now we're talking yeah yeah yeah

yeah that's great let's figure that out

all right yeah maybe an online poll it's

political corruption in Boston we'll

come back to that if we have time but I

like the rat cat rat cat that's great

what blow the roof off that eats the

movie critics are hailing as genuinely

deflating and depressingly accurate The

Oregonian raves but who needs a Drake

for reporters uh actually I'm taking a

buyout three reporters technically I'm

not a reporter I'm the director of

social media strategies but I consider

myself an important part of the editor

to reporters I'm also leaving I'm being

replaced by Ripa though this is one

reporter and some kind of burnt orange X

choose the story of a lifetime what is

the thing dog until RocketBallz we're

talking all the way up to the mayor I

got kids man I want to sit - yo yo honey

is all hey nobody Holley and Arica

mcdonnen Hey sorry to interrupt

hi hi doing buddy I gotta talk to you

about your Twitter it's like a ghost

town in here what's going on man we

talked about this eight tweets a day I'm

in the middle of t-bone how many tweets

eight that's right okay we're not

counting retweets he wasn't just up

against the most powerful voices in City

Hall I need answers and you're the only

one who could give him to me he was up

against the most powerful voices at his

newspapers fair in

we gotta show people that no one can get

away with this we got a nail League

scumbags let me stop you right there

hopefully we can get to the point where

we can do racoon cats and City Hall but

we're not there so few the

journal-constitution raids actually we

had to get rid of our full-time movie

reviewer nine years ago so we haven't

seen it yet and the Las Vegas

review-journal says for fun and

excitement look no further than Sheldon

Adelson's casinos and resorts don't care

about you people I still believe in

newspapers I hear you but technically

you don't work for a newspaper anymore

you work at a multi-platform content

generation distribution network now the

REC cat is it adorable or skim you know

what it's like it's cute could it be

scary though we could make it scary as

mics get some clicks cuz some retweets

get some forward I'm talking about

corruption in City Hall yeah we're gonna

get back the archdiocese gotta keep it

moving I gotta keep it moving we just

need a story we can fun okay bud

you know yeah there you go like a little

piggies tail funnel vision exactly think

of like a witch's head upside down went

for the car monocle actually we

rebranded yeah you work for short

is charm hey there you go that's a good

idea for a story stoplight he tried to

break the story he was told to pump the

brakes

oh hey Tommy hey got great news for you

I'm gonna take you off that whole City

Hall thing have you worked the raccoon

cat beat with Chloe air cat record

Melissa

reckon cow anyway I really want you to

dig on this thing okay you know dig like

a raccoon cat stop light

coming soon to a midsize American city

newspaper near you

immigration the system that brought you

me but it's still good and I promise

that won't happen again

immigration has been dominating the news

all week long as a caravan of migrants

from Central America continues to head

north and despite it being a thousand

miles and possibly months away Trump has

made it a centerpiece of his closing

arguments heading into the midterms at

this very moment large well organized

caravans of migrants are marching toward

our southern border some people call it

an invasion it's like an invasion a lot

of young men strong men and a lot of men

that maybe we don't want in our country

I don't want them in our country and

women don't want them in our country

women want security men don't want them

in our country but the women do not want

them women want security why young

strong men are invading our country and

coming from our women that is such old

timey racism I'm genuinely amazed that

imogen automatically turned black and

white as he thought like Pleasantville

in Reverse this week Trump has been

threatening immigration actions ranging

from sending 15,000 troops to the border

to ending birthright citizenship and

look it is hard to know what the

president will or even can do going

forward so tonight instead of focusing

on hypotheticals I thought it might be

useful to look backwards at something

he absolutely did do concerning

immigrants family separation it was part

of his zero-tolerance policy where

parents crossing the border were locked

up prosecuted and had their children

taken away the story dominated the news

back in June with distressing images of

kids in cages and shelters milania's

very cool jackets reading I really don't

care to you and of course this moment I

read today about a ten-year-old girl

with Down syndrome who was taken from

her mother and put in a cage I read

about a a they just they won't want to a

ten-year-old with Down syndrome yes he

did yes Coelho and Taos Key said

womp-womp but and if there is any

justice that will be carved on his

gravestone and when he arrives at the

pearly gates the first thing he'll he

all be oh hi Cori I've been waiting a

long time to say this to you 1 put warm

after a national outcry and court

challenges the President signed an order

reversing course and the story kind of

faded from the headlines but it is

really worth revisiting because a number

of government reports recently came out

giving us a much clearer picture of what

was actually happening and while it

seemed malicious and chaotic at the time

at every step it was even worse than you

might assume so let's look at two major

aspects of family separation how it was

done and why and it starts with the how

because you may remember heartbreaking

stories of parents unsure where their

children had been taken but when Alex SR

Secretary of Health and Human Services

was asked about this he reassured

everyone that there was nothing to worry

about there is no reason why any parent

would not know where their child is

located I could at the stroke of ethic

at keystrokes I've sat on the ORR portal

with sit with just basic keystrokes

within seconds could find any child in

our care for any parent you know it's

not every day that you see a man testify

with the goal of convincing people he

has access to a lot of kids on his

computer seriously guys just a few taps

on the old keyboard and it's kid City on

this thing pretty much the second I open

my computer boob I'm up to my neck in

children and yes I heard how that sounds

and you know what I like it well I saw

may have known where the kids in his

custody were that was only one piece of

the puzzle the critical information that

allowed kids to be matched with parents

was compiled by a different Department

Homeland Security and an Inspector

General report found that their data was

not just incomplete and inconsistent but

that each step of this process was

vulnerable to human error increasing the

risk that a child could be lost in the

system which is terrible you should be

able to lose children in a government

system as easily as in a chuck-e-cheese

ball pit I'm sorry we're gonna have to

call off the search mrs. Donaldson

Ralphie's loss to the balls now

in fact what we've been told that the

government separated around 2600

children and around 220 kids are still

being held away from their parents we

actually can't say for sure whether

either of those numbers are accurate

just two weeks ago the government

apparently found 14 more children and

added them to Italian just think about

that 14 children were missing and we

didn't even know it how was that not a

bigger story when those 12 boys were

stuck in a cave in Thailand there were

live cameras and Elon Musk was sending

submersibles and calling rescuers

pedophiles now I'm not saying that's

what I wanted to happen here I didn't

want it to happen then but at least

people are paying attention and

all this incompetence should have been

obvious because when nonprofits tried to

check on the kids the government often

didn't have a good system to locate

those that were listed as being present

we were given a list by the government

and we were told that we could choose

who we wanted to speak to looking

through the list of over 500 names I

noticed that there were some very young

children there including a two year old

several one year olds and one child that

was listed as being zero so I asked to

see those children they left and came

back and said that they couldn't find

the children they said to me what we

called out their name and nobody

responded so we don't know where they

are so I sort of said there's babies

their babies obviously they're not gonna

respond to their name being called okay

anyone who calls a babies name and then

gives up on finding them either knows

nothing about babies or is covering for

a baby who doesn't actually want to be

reached sorry

so it just tell them I'm not in today

I'm Optima diaper in triangles over here

I've got a 2:30 meeting with my young

toes to prep for Mondays I'm all right

seriously am i right I don't know the

days of the week I am after all a

baby and even with even with the

help of nonprofits in locating and

reuniting parents hundreds of whom

incidentally were actually deported

without their children the government

still had like when one mother

who'd had her five month old

breastfeeding baby taken away was later

handed back the wrong baby and just to

imagine thinking you're about to be

reunited with your child after being

forced apart

and being given someone else's shitty

baby I'd say this as a parents my infant

is a miracle and a joy anyone else's is

a charmless snots monster get it away

from me

so to put it mildly

when it comes to how did we do this the

answer seems to be a combination of

incompetently and cruelly which brings

us to the other big question why why did

we do this well so many Trump

administration argue that they simply

had no choice are you intending for this

to play out as it is playing out are you

intending for parents to be separated

from their children are you intending to

send a message I find that offensive no

because what why would I ever create a

policy that purposely does that no no a

deterrent I would never you offend me

sir here's the thing about this

administration you can always tell you

figured out exactly what they're doing

when they get offended by your

description of what they might be doing

it's a pretty obvious tone he's like a

poker player ejaculating every time they

have a good hand okay I think we all see

what's happening here now often the

official line was that family

separations were not a deterrent they

were simply a consequence of having to

enforce the law as the then acting head

of ice

Thomas Holman explained at the time

every law enforcement agency in this

country separates parents from children

when they're arrested for a crime we are

a law enforcement agency we are

enforcing the criminal laws I don't

blame anybody want to be the greatest

country in there at being a part of this

greatest country on earth which we all

are but there are a white way to do it

there's a wrong way to do it okay it's

pretty hard to listen to someone say

with the greatest country on Earth while

simultaneously justifying why we're

unnecessarily ripping kids away from

their parents especially when that

person looks like what would happen if a

kind of monster energy drink John

Lithgow but a few things there regarding

the right way because first many of

these people were applying for asylum

meaning they're seeking protection from

persecution and under international and

US law it is legal to apply for that no

matter how you enter the country second

while the Trump administration insisted

that the right way for solemn seekers to

come in was through a port of entry like

an official border crossing they made it

far

more difficult to do that with many be

repeatedly denied entry into the country

and forced to wait days or even weeks

and you can't just arbitrarily delay

people that long

there are solemn seekers looking for

safety not AT&T customers trying to

speak to a representative that's right

no finally finally crossing the border

in the wrong way is actually only a

misdemeanor on first offense in fact

most people are usually just sentenced

to time served and that's the thingy

contrary to what you might think most of

the parents who were separated from

their kids were charged to plead guilty

and serve their sentence all fairly

quickly now in the past we generally

didn't prosecute parents and even let

many of them go free awaiting their

immigration hearing which makes sense so

why did we suddenly start keeping people

who had already served their time locked

up and away from their kids

well because Trump hated the old system

he called it catch and release and he

described it in wildly misleading terms

we catch a criminal a real criminal a

rough tough criminal we take his name

and then we release him and we say

please show up to court in a couple of

months you know what the chances of

getting up the quarter like zero okay

now deep down when Trump said the number

zero you just instinctively knew that no

matter what the number was it was

definitely not zero right because if he

says something's hot it's cold if he

said something's up it's down if he said

this is a cute puppy you'd automatically

think I'm not sure why or how but that

puppy is definitely a asshole

and when it comes to family seeking

asylum who remember were the ones

largely impacted by family separation

the number is ridiculously far from zero

because 96% of them turned up to court

after being released from detention and

under Obama administration program

called family case management where each

family was assigned a case manager who

then helped them navigate the system

99.3% attended their hearing so Trump

was wrong he was 99.3% wrong and you

know what that means

you probably expecting the tiger to come

out now but sadly he died of sadness

several months ago so all this but now

does is increase my morphine drip so it

just numbs the pain it's not perfect but

it helps see you later now Trump

discontinued that case management

program despite the fact that even ice

called it an overall success and went

with ripping families apart instead so

for the final time

why if they'd already paid the price for

their crime and there were other better

ways to ensure that they showed up for

court why the everlasting did we

really do this well I would argue that

this is the logical result of a general

hard right turn toward demonizing

immigrants for political advantage in a

way that some might call racist and

others would be wrong about now

conservative immigration arguments

essentially now follow a pretty clear

pattern crossing the border is a crime

therefore anyone crossing it is a

criminal and since all criminals are

dangerous anyone crossing the border is

a dangerous criminal never mind the fact

that immigrants are less likely to

commit crimes than people born here that

has simply not stopped Republicans from

running toxic anti-immigrant anti

caravan political ads like these a young

woman gunned down by an illegal

immigrant who should have been deported

illegal aliens invade America Democrats

who stand in our way will be complicit

in every murder committed

by illegal immigrants Mexican drug lords

ms-13 gang members sex traffickers ms-13

violent gang members gang members known

criminals people from the Middle East oh



you know that's racist because they just

gave up any pretense of specific

fear-mongering and simply said people

from the Middle East at that point why

not go all in and just start naming

groups you hate the caravan also

contains Planned Parenthood gays who

want wedding cakes black Santa and a

thirty-foot Nancy Pelosi Democrats will

be complicit in every person the giant

Pelosi is and if you watch enough of

those ads you realize it's not that they

don't want immigrants to come here

because they're criminals is that

they're calling them criminals because

they don't want them to come here and to

see that in action

just watch this exchange that CNN had

with a New Jersey Trump supporter so

you're worried about immigration only

coming in the illegal way not the legal

way come in the legal way and you are

more than welcome I mean it is legal to

seek asylum well I hope Trump changes

that you don't want any asylum seekers

no no it's simply not often that you see

someone's cover story fall apart with so

little are you three kids wearing

a trench coat no do you want some ice

cream yes there are three of us and we

all like chocolates we're we're now so

accustomed to see immigrants as a threat

the politicians routinely talk about

them in the language of war remember

Trump referred to the caravan as an

invasion and sent troops to the border

and that kind of militaristic talk can

make people think that it is necessary

to make the kind of impossible choices

made during a war which is how things

like family separation happen just

watches Jessica Vaughn of an

anti-immigration think-tank tries to

justify what we did a lot of Americans

find it appalling what do you say to

them I think it's appalling that we have

to do it what do you think the

consequences are for these children that

have gone

that are still going through this trauma

I think it's very possible that some of

these kids war will have some lasting

effects right

but lasting damage to children is a huge

consequence you're separating them from

their parents not telling them you ate

all their Halloween candy to get on

Jimmy Kimmel while we're on that

topic know what to do that I mean I'm

really glad that some people do because

it's extremely funny but nobody should

but please keep doing it and while she

acknowledges that what we're doing is

appalling she says we have to do it but

the truth is we don't we don't have to

do any of it because even though the

language of war is being used there is

not a war and the only reason people

keep talking like there is one is to

give themselves permission to make the

choices they want to be forced to make

but family separation cannot be one of

them because as she says these kids will

have some lasting effects but what

that's easy to say in the context of

abstract pediatric science the reality

of it is heartbreaking take

Henry he's a six-year-old from Honduras

he was separated from his mother and

reunited after a month apart but as a

documentary crew found their ordeal was

far from over and I'm warning you this

is going to be rough to watch

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

the Colosseum formerly artemiy who had

come down mucho somewhere get hurt we

who ya knows wait to eHome yeah we did

that and not because we had to but

because we chose to and horrific ly we

may actually be about to do it again

Trump has publicly 30 with bringing back

family separation and Thomas home and

supported that idea during a recent

interview with Fox & Friends

or as it's not in the business a

face-to-face meeting with the president

well let me talk about the

zero-tolerance policy that was the right

thing to do regardless how sad and

unfortunate no one was he family

separated but when they separated those

people that were prosecuted into the

country illegally the numbers went down

22% in just two weeks if they would have

stuck with that for 30 60 days there

wouldn't be a caravan today yeah maybe

Tom and you know what if we surrounded

the border with randomly firing

flamethrowers and snakes that we tried

to stand up whenever anyone approached

that could potentially drive the caravan

away to but we don't do things like that

cuz it's not supposed to be who we

are

and painfully aware for this Trump

here's that idea coming out of a

television he may well go someone write

that down

snakes and flamethrowers that's a great

idea I had it that's my idea so look

look if the president really wants to

make Tuesdays in election about him and

about immigration

then then fine let's make it about that

because family separation is perhaps the

most emblematic moment of his presidency

so far it was cruel

sloppy needless racist and ultimately

exactly what we should have expected and

I would argue the biggest threat to our

status as the greatest nation on earth

is not a caravan a thousand miles south

of us it's whoever thinks that doing

this is an acceptable response

you

I would like to talk to you about the

sausage principle the theory that says

if you love something never find out how

it was made well tonight I would like to

show you my sausage wait wait this is my

sausage the 2014 FIFA World Cup okay the

World Cup starts this week and I am both

excited and extremely conflicted about

it now I know in America soccer is

something you pick your ten-year-old

daughter up from but but for me and

everyone else on earth it's a little

more important soccer had become

d'azyr's religion in Colombia soccer was

a religion football is a religion here

soccer or football like we say it's a

religion yeah and they're not

exaggerating when David Beckham got a

tattoo of Jesus the response of most

soccer fans was that that's huge for

Jesus that's that's a big deal for him

hey here's here's my conflict the World

Cup is one of my favorite things but

it's organized by these guys

FIFA you either know it as the

fédération Internationale de Football

Association or that soccer video game

you have but for American viewers who

may never have encountered them FIFA is

a comically grotesque organization in

fact telling someone about the inner

workings of FIFA for the first time it's

a bit like showing someone two girls one

cup yeah you do it mainly so you can

watch the horrified expression on

people's faces

because let's start where FIFA's current

World Cup is about to take place

Brazil Brazilians are excited about

everything this is how they celebrate

the fact that it's just about to be Lent

they love the concept of giving up

chocolate temporarily they're also the

biggest soccer fans on earth so they

must be thrilled at the prospect of

hosting the World Cup there's been

months of unrest in some of the cities

for villas or slums with clashes between

police and residents here people

demonstrated against Brazil holding the

World Cup that makes no sense why would

you be unhappy hosting the thing that

you love the most in all the world the

government has spent more than eleven

billion dollars getting ready the United

States team will play its second game

here in the city of Manaus in this

brand-new 270 million dollar stadium

Manaus is so remote that it's almost

impossible to reach by car which is why

officials had to have the stadium

materials brought in by boat shipped

across the Atlantic from Portugal and up

the Amazon River okay that does seem

like a waste of money especially when

you consider that that stadium is only

going to be used for for World Cup games

there's also no team in Manaus that can

fill it afterwards at which point it

becomes the world's most expensive bird

toilet

no wonder Brazilians are so upset

especially when you think about what

they are actually getting in return well

in their gonna make money as well as

we're worried this ng FIFA makes the

money this is where the controversy is

the country usually doesn't make money

FIFA the organization of the World Cup

is who makes the money yep Brazil let me

put this in terms you might understand

think of money as pubic hair and FIFA as

wax they're gonna be all over you during

the World Cup but when they go they're

taking all the money with them

including some from places you didn't

even know you had any money leaving you

teary eyes going Jesus what happened

here what happened I'm never doing this

again because here are FIFA's tax

demands for prospective host countries

it is FIFA and it's FIFA subsidiaries

that are fully exempt from any tax

whatsoever levied at whatever level

state level municipality level all sorts

of taxes consumption taxes income taxes

you name it it's all attempt that's

right by Brazil's own estimates they're

allowing FIFA to forego 250 million

dollars in taxes somewhere Wesley Snipes

is going so soccer was the answer God it

seems so obvious now now now FIFA says

they leave a lot behind which they do

like new laws because you see once upon

a time Brazil did this in 2003 the

Brazilian government banned alcohol from

stadiums because of the enormous ly high

death rate amongst fans that seems like

a good idea

potentially lifesaving even the only

problem is Budweiser is one of FIFA's

key sponsors and they sell a product

they reflexively insist on calling beer

and FIFA seemed anxious to protect

Budweiser from a law designed to protect

people

which is why FIFA Secretary General went

to Brazil with a simple message I'm

sorry to say and maybe I look a bit

arrogant but that something will not

negotiator I mean there will be and

there must be as part of the of the law

the fact that we have the right to sell

beer is a maybe I look a bit arrogant

but how you say your laws and your

public safety is this adds a drag

and the amazing thing is here FIFA won

they successfully pressured Brazil into

passing a so-called Budweiser bill

allowing beer sales in soccer stadiums

and at this point you can either be

horrified by that or relieved that FIFA

wasn't also sponsored by cocaine and

chainsaws and Brazil Brazil is lucky cuz

you're lucky

at least they just had FIFA force

alcohol on them when South Africa hosted

the World Cup four years ago FIFA forced

the creation of the FIFA World Cup

courts which sound funny annoyed it's

like going to the World Series and being

dragged in front of Judge Phillie

Phanatic except FIFA's courts were no

joke to Zimbabweans who robbed foreign

journalists on a Wednesday were arrested

on a Thursday and began 15 years L

sentences the next day that is

unsettlingly fast that's like when you

order Chinese food and it comes five

minutes later thanks very much but that

was too quick you didn't have time to

make this properly and there is a

certain irony in FIFA setting up any

kind of justice system given the

scandals that have dogged it over the

years football's governing body is

trying to tackle its shady inner

workings by suspending two executives on

corruption charges the FIFA scandal

rumbles on Jack Warner who was at the

center of bribery accusations has

resigned as vice president there's been

so many corruption scandals that FIFA

have had to deal with bribery and FIFA

go together like peanut butter and jelly

yeah but they shouldn't though peanut

butter and jelly are supposed to go

together FIFA and bribery should go

together like peanut butter and a child

with a deadly nut allergy no no it's for

your brother

I like it do you think FIFA can't get

any more cartoonishly evil this is their

headquarters actual boardroom that's

right

FIFA apparently modeled where they meet

on the war room from dr. Strangelove

that is Exhibit A for an organization

that does not give a what you think

about them and yet the head of FIFA

maintains that they are merely a humble

nonprofit organization we are a

nonprofit organization and we have to

remain a non-profit organism nonprofit

with over a billion dollars in the bank

yeah but this is a reserve a reserve a

reserve of a billion dollars when your

rainy day fund is so big you've got to

check it for swimming cartoon ducks you

might not be a not profit anymore but

that by the way

is Sepp Blatter and even his name should

have been a red flag if your name is set

at the bare minimum

you've strangled someone in a bar fight

that's just a fact I let me just give

you a taste of Sepp Blatter as a human

being recently he was asked how should

women's soccer be made more popular he

said well they should wear shorter

shorts great idea

put the ladies in hot pants call it foxy

soccer and while you're at it tighten up

the jerseys maybe replace the ball with

a plate of hot wings and KITT let's just

open her hooters FIFA FIFA the humble

non profits even recently spent 27

billion dollars to fund United passions

a fictionalized version of their history

starring for some reason Tim Roth as

Sepp Blatter and this movie like FIFA

itself looks terrible

will be the fédération Internationale de

Football Association FIFA the first war

Cup will be held in Uruguay you have

everything you need to run a family but

you know the slightest error and you're

up

who makes a sports film where their

heroes are the executives and the crazy

thing is you don't need two hours and

Tim Roth because the greatest film about

Sepp Blatter has already been made it's

ten seconds long and it's on YouTube

wonderfully that is the one time you can

genuinely say I'm glad that old man fell

off that stage but perhaps the worst

part of FIFA is not even its past or its

present its its future because the host

of the 2022 World Cup has already been

decided do we know to organize the 2:22

FIFA World Cup is Qatar Qatar there's

between 1 and 50 reasons why that is an

awful idea summer temperatures in Qatar

can reach some 50 degrees Celsius a

difficult environment to hold a

professional sporting than outdoors 50

degrees Celsius is 122 degrees

Fahrenheit you are hosting the World Cup

somewhere where soccer cannot physically

be played that's like if the NFL chose

to host the Super Bowl in a lake now

that there are no allegations that some

fee for executives took bribes to put

the World Cup in Qatar and I hope that's

true because otherwise it makes

literally no sense and not just because

of the weather but because of the

working conditions guitar is a slave

state in the 21st century a migrant

worker can't leave the country without

an exit visa that visa has to be

approved by his employer who has your

passport and a bottle they know each

other so you're trapped here we've got

coffins coming home every day more than

a worker per day on average is dying

conservatively from the figures of just

two countries India and Nepal more than

4,000 workers will die before a ball is

kicked off in 2022 so what you're

essentially saying is the Qatar World

Cup is shaping up to be the most deadly

Middle East construction project since

this one and and by this point I hope

I've proven to you that FIFA is just

appalling and yet here's their power I

am still so excited about the world

next week and it's very hard to justify

how I can get so much joy from an

organization that's caused so much pain

other than going back to right where we

started soccer or football like we say

it's a religion but it's not just that

it's an organized religion and FIFA is

its Church just think about it its

leader is infallible it compels South

American countries to spend money they

don't have building opulent cathedrals

and it may ultimately be responsible for

the deaths of shocking numbers of people

in the Middle East

but-but-but-but the millions of people

around the world like me it is also the

guardian of the only thing that gives

their lives any meaning and if that

comparison does not make Americans love

soccer then frankly nothing will

this is actually our last show of the

season for our main story we thought

we'd pull back a little bit and look at

one of the biggest questions that has

defined this year how good was a star is

born star was born over the weekend a

great movie and it was amazing it was

amazing it's still on my heart

Bradley Cooper had ahold of my soul

there for a little while it's uh it it

is beyond great maybe it's time let the

old ways

Bradley Cooper oh my gosh go see the

movie go see it yeah that guy loves him

and he's distinctive for the Dallas

Cowboys

no one doesn't like a star is born it's

the one movie that even Neil deGrasse

Tyson can't ruin John I had a small

issue with the film see if you want to

know how a star is actually born you

start with a gas cloud shut up shut up

you shut up Neil deGrasse Tyson let this

be the one thing about Stassi don't

ruined

unfortunately we're not talking about a

star is born tonight in fact we're going

to talk about the exact opposite of that

movie the troubling rise of

authoritarian leaders around the world a

lot of them there are the ones that you

instinctively think about like your

bladder Mir Putin and Xi Jingping who've

been steadily consolidating their power

there's the re-election of strong men

like Hungary's Viktor Orban and turkeys

worship Diwan and then there's what

happened just last month in the world's

fifth largest country Brazil has a new

president becoming a latest nation to

elect a far-right leader extreme right

populist bolson era has exalted the

country's military dictatorship

advocated torture and threatened to

destroy jail or drive his political

opponents into exile is calling for

unity oh that's nice he's calling for

unity is he yet the problem is he

expressed an affection for torture and

dictatorship before that and political

platforms are a bit like tinder profiles

once you advocate torture it doesn't

really matter what else you say it's all

the people are gonna remember and for

good reason and not what what well no to

authoritarian leaders are the same the

global trend toward them is alarming

especially because in many cases people

are actively choosing them a report

recently concluded that one-third of the

world's population lives in a

backsliding democracy and that is why

there's a pretty good chance that you

may have been watching the news at some

point this year and found yourself

saying what the is happening to the

world and why so tonight let's look at

three common traits that authoritarian

leaders tend to have to try and figure

out what can make them so appealing to

people and to what extent this country

is in danger of heading in the same

direction and the first trait is

projecting strength authoritarians tend

to love grand displays of force like the

military parades featuring weaponry that

you've seen places like China North

Korea Venezuela and Russia where they'll

even sometimes throw in a surprise

musical number

[Music]

yeah what a warning there Russia

that's what musicals are like when you

don't allow gay people tell you that

spectacles like those serve a purpose as

many authoritarians project strength out

of a real concern that they may be seen

as illegitimate in kind of the same way

that a man who is insecure about his

penis buys a motorcycle or takes up

bodybuilding or invents the Tesla how

how weird is your penis even how weird

is it but projecting military strength

often isn't enough men you

authoritarians tend to conflate their

country's national identity with their

personal identity so they individually

need to appear strong to that most

obvious example of this is Vladimir

Putin who's taken so many glamor shots

there are calendars of him that the

latest ones feature him

cuddling leopards taking a shirtless ice

bath and sunbathing which cool but but

but he's not alone there's also Chechen

leader Ramzan Kadyrov's ridiculous

workout videos which I frankly cannot

recommend highly enough it's like

watching a Keebler Elf get ripped

although my favorite example of this is

also actually the saddest just watch as

the authoritarian president of

Turkmenistan forces his cabinet to watch

him take a gold bar and do whatever this

is

Wow when you go to work tomorrow and

you're forced to laugh at your

supervisors dumb jokes just spare a

thought for the people who had to give a

standing ovation to their boss for

lifting a golden curtain right so so

authoritarians are obsessed with

projecting strength and I often tell

their citizens that that strength is

necessary to protect them from what well

that actually brings us to their second

major trait a tendency to demonize

enemies authoritarians often go out of

their way to identify and sometimes

manufacture a group of evildoers from

whom they and they alone can save the

country in the Philippines Rodrigo

Duterte rose to power by claiming he was

the antidote to drug crime since 2016

Human Rights Watch estimates that his

drug war has killed more than 12,000

people many of them extrajudicially and

that shouldn't really be entirely

surprising given that this was an actual

message that his campaign issued at

Christmas alone in your acquittal lemon

verbena buddy Cooper in Merry Christmas

crema de Rugy star Bogdanov oh crap

criminal at the UNEP a pair of so

pilipino Hawaiian young metal at pitoni

para el corazon eaten a hole in you

Merry Christmas oh boy that is a hard

turn in a Christmas message although it

actually does remind me with

Thanksgiving coming up this week you

know I just like to take a moment to

wish a Happy Thanksgiving to everyone

watching this tonight especially if

you're a turkey because we're going to

slit your throat stuck your dumb bird

corpse with Brad's chopped vegetables

garlic and rosemary and then bake you in

an oven for four hours it's what you

deserve this will be your final

Happy Thanksgiving

sorry where was I oh that's right

authoritarian Sneed enemies because one

of their greatest appeals is making a

complicated world simple if you're under

attack or you've been made to feel that

way it is nice to have a charismatic

individual say the rules the

system I've got this

that's an impulse that we're all

vulnerable to take me I believe in the

separation of powers and the rule of law

but if America were to descend into a

Civil War and someone said hey what if

we just let Tom Hanks figure it out a

not insignificant part of me would go

yeah that seems nice in fact all praise

Daddy Hanks long live the Gump of death

to his enemies when people are

frightened they can be more susceptible

to authoritarians that is why if a real

threat doesn't present itself strong men

will sometimes make one up often

targeting a group that's persecuted to

begin with like immigrants or minorities

Viktor orbán's right would turn in

hungary has been accompanied by stoking

fear of Muslims and refugees and when

Putin was facing a dip in popularity a

few years ago he went after gay people

suggesting that homosexuality was a

weapon of the EU to weaken Russia which

yes sounds ridiculous but judging by

this man the message may have gone

across Russia is not Europe we have our

own conservative traditional values at

the moment in Europe these boundaries

are being crossed because they're

legalizing pedophilia they're legalizing

zoophilia they have zoo brothels wait

are you sure about that

he's I'm pretty confident that there is

no such thing as a zoo brothel a zoo

brothel is if anything just a regular

zoo where you can split the zookeeper 20

bucks to leave you alone in the penguin

area and you would hope don't think

about that if you don't like it just

don't absorb it just don't absorb the

idea in your mind and you would hope

that an independent press or an

opposition party might push back on that

sort of which actually brings

us to our final key trait which is

dismantling institutions because as they

gain power or ferret Aryans will try to

weaken any check on them journalists in

authoritarian regimes are frequently

threatened in

and killed or in putin's russia have

tragic accidents that hopefully others

may learn from an authoritarian will

also attack even more foundational

checks and balances like courts and

legislatures in recent years the

structures of government in Turkey China

Hungary and Venezuela have all been

modified to consolidate power under

their leaders and as Poland becomes

increasingly authoritarian their de

facto leader no longer has to worry

about the country's highest judge or

indeed many other judges because he his

party cleverly managed to force them out

simply by lowering their retirement age

and when some judges showed up to work

anyway in protest a government official

had this patronizing response they can

enter the building they can be their

vacant they can be there as guests but

they cannot work as judges because they

are retired I really don't blame those

judges for being furious about that

because as we all now know there are

only two ways to really piss off a judge

one force them into retirement or to ask

how many brews they'd usually pound when

working out with Vijay and squeeze they

don't like that at all so so look

projecting strange demonizing enemies

and dismantling institutions are very

broadly some key things that

authoritarians do and if you're

wondering who would ever want a leader

who does that the answer is lots of

people many people support Tudor Tate

not despite his authoritarian tendencies

but because of them

the way Filipinos have become too

disorderly and comfortable I think we

need a president that can implement

measures and discipline us it's so

obvious that the media is biased because

they only show the killings why don't

they show the other stuff he's doing

like all the infrastructure he's

building wait what

anything credible to hear someone click

brushing off killings and complaining

that more attention to be paid to

infrastructure she must be the only

person in the world who could hear a

story about a government death squad

throwing someone off a bridge you say

wait tell me more about that bridge

sturdy enough for a whole squad you say

very impressive as we've gone through

each of these traits you may have found

yourself thinking uh-oh some of these

are ringing a bell so unfortunately we

do now have to bring the story back

around to this guy our current president

because he definitely exhibits many of

the things that you've seen so far

tonight

he loves appearing strong he actually

wanted a military parade and when it

comes to demonizing enemies

he's gleefully gone after immigrants and

other marginalized groups as well as

picking aggressively optional battles

with Canada the NFL Mark Cuban the FBI

Robert DeNiro

the 2017 Emmy Awards Puerto Rico the

postal service an upscale farm-to-table

restaurant in Lexington Virginia the NSA

levar ball the city of Chicago the Mayor

of London the CEO of Merck Nordstrom and

Chrissy Teigen and that is only

counting the Twitter feuds and Trump has

openly expressed admiration for many of

the authoritarians you've seen including

specifically praising Tudor tea for the

unbelievable job he was doing cleaning

up crime in the Philippines Trump even

once retweeted a parody account that is

attributed to him the quote it is better

to live one day as a lion than a hundred

years as a sheep which isn't actually

something that Trump said it's a slogan

Mussolini used that's right it was

synonymous with pasture Hitler and and

when that was pointed out to Trump this

was his response did you know it was

Rosellini it's okay to know it's Bruce

Elaine yeah look Mussolini was Mussolini

it's okay

it's a very good quote it's a very

interesting quote and I know it I saw it

I saw what I know who said it but what

difference does it make whether it's

Mussolini is somebody else and so

certainly a very interesting quote you

want to be associated with a fascist no

I want to be associated with interesting

quotes okay okay so first let's agree

there's roughly 50% chance that Donald

Trump thinks that Mussolini is just an

Italian moose it's a coin flip and

second if being associated with

interesting quotes is the goal there are

better ones many of them attributing to

people who have committed far fewer war

crimes how about this one another thing

I like to do is give my vagina a little

vitamin D Trump didn't say that shailene

woodley did but it's a very interesting

quote and what I think we should

associate Trump with and it's worth

noting that was from before he was

elected president his entire tone on the

campaign trail was of an unapologetic

strong man I'm gonna bomb the out

of them I don't care like to punch him

in the face I'll tell you Gitmo we're

keeping that open now we're gonna load

it up with bad dudes we're gonna load it

up with a lot of bad dudes what your

works okay folks don't you know I have

these guys torture doesn't work believe

me it works okay Wow so bomb punch

imprison torture we just need to see

Trump lift a gold bar and do a topless

calendar shoot and we basically got

authoritarian bingo right there and the

thing is people liked that in fact it

may be the thing about Trump they liked

the most

watch how his supporters responded when

he described how Putin deals with

journalists and then they said you know

he's killed reporters and I don't like

that I'm totally against that I by the

way I hate some of these people but I'd

never kill him I hate him no I think no

these people honestly I'll be honest

I'll be honest I would never kill them

I would never do that ah that's safe no

I wouldn't I would never kill him but I

do hate him and I some of them are such

lying disgusting people it's true now

that is legitimately scary because I

know that Trump is kidding there but I'm

not sure that everyone in that audience

is and they are flirting with something

very dangerous because Trump will do

anything if it gets a big enough cheer

the difference between joking about

something and actually doing it is only

about 30 decibels on the

applause-o-meter so so the real worry

here isn't just that Trump sounds like

an authoritarian it's that many people

in this country like the way that sounds

we need somebody's tough Trump just

shows toughness and I love that it's

finally got some busting balls I'm gonna

feel safer in our country with him as a

president let me tell you if Jesus

Christ gets down off the cross and told

me Trump is with Russia I will tell him

hold on a second I need a check with the

president if it's true I honestly don't

know what's more depressing there the

thought of that man believe in it Trump

over Jesus all the thought of Jesus

coming back as someone who won't shut up

about Trump and Russia Jesus we get it

yet we all agree with you but you know

we get it no no I didn't see Maddow

Jesus was she on fire

so it's pretty clear by this point the

Trump shares many characteristics with

authoritarian leaders and yet we're not

currently an authoritarian state so why

is that well thankfully while Trump has

done terrible things as president our

institutions generally speaking so far

have been just strong enough to hold up

against his most authoritarian instincts

he's not managed to shut down the Muller

investigation yet he apparently wants to

end birthright citizenship but that's

not something a president can do and

just this week his efforts to ban a CNN

reporter from the White House were

halted by a judge that he himself had

appointed and that's good but there's no

doubt Trump is testing the system

appointing this well-dressed fire

hydrant as his acting Attorney General

is a worrying sign as are his repeated

attempts to delegitimize elections by

declaring results that he doesn't like

fraudulence so people do need to remain

vigilant and that is the key thing here

because while we may talk about

institutions being strong what that

actually means is that people are

working very hard to protect them and to

use them to contain this president's

worst impulses he's lost in court

because people have sued him he's kept

the Russian investigation going because

his advisors know there would be a

public outcry if he stopped it and to

the extent that Congress is able to

check him going forward it's because

people turned up at the midterms to keep

doing those things because the world is

dabbling with something very dangerous

right now

and America needs to be careful and look

I know democracy can be often by design

frustrating checks and balances can be

irritating and slow and might not

deliver the outcome that you wanted but

removing them opens the door to

something much worse and that is true

whether you live in Russia Turkey

Hungary the Philippines Brazil or yes

the United States and I know that

America is a different country with a

different history and thankfully more

resilient institutions but that is no

cause for complacency because the truth

is the honest answer to could

authoritarianism happen here is and

possibly always will be no I think no
